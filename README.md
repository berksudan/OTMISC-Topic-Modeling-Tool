# Topic modeling advancements

## Task description
- evaluate different Topic Modeling algorithms on short/long text dataset
- draw observations on the applicability of certain algorithmsâ€™ clusters to different types of datasets

## Datasets 
- https://crisisnlp.qcri.org/
- http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/

For further information see the Survey_of_Topic_Modeling_Algorithm.pdf

## How to Build

+ For Linux, It is enough to run the following command for setting up virtual environment and install dependencies.

```bash
$ chmod u+x ./build.sh && ./build.sh
```

+ For windows and other operating systems, install `python 3.8`, and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Be careful about the package versions and make sure that you have the correct version in your current set up!
