I don't have nor Imagine nor Real 3d, but as old
Amiga user I think you should take a look also to 
Real 3d 2.0 for the Amiga. I saw Imagine 2.0 on the
Amiga for a long time at my friend's home, and
I've seen R3D 2.0 in action at Bit.Movie 93 in Riccione,
Italy (an Italian Computer Graphics Contest).
Many professionals using 3d Studio on PC, SoftImage
for Silicon Graphics and Imagine on the Amiga were 
*VERY IMPRESSED* by the power of this programs.
Sorry, I've lost the posting with full description 
of features of this great program.

For more informations give a look in comp.sys.amiga.graphics.

Representative of Activa International told me that
it will be out in 2 weeks for the Amiga and that
PC MS-Windows, Silicon Indigo and Unix version are 
under development.

Ciao,

Hello,

easily accessible from the UNIX environment. 

     The names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any 
experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.

     Please respond via email; I will post a summary if there is 
sufficient interest.


Thanks,

Hi Everyone ::

I am  looking for  some software  called SHADOW as 
far as  I know  its a   simple  raytracer  used in
the  visualization  of  synchrotron   beam  lines.
Now we have  an  old  version of the  program here
,but unfortunately we don't have any documentation
if anyone knows  where I  can  get  some  docs, or
maybe  a  newer  version  of  the program or  even 
another  program that does the same sort of  thing
I would love to hear from you.

PS I think SHADOW was written by a F Cerrina?

Anyone any ideas?

Thanks -Gary- SERC Daresbury Lab.

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.

>(sadly, I have access to none of them.  Just a DEC 5000/25.  Sigh.)

Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+
card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

Unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a
switch isn't going to help them.  If you aren't using your com ports for
anything else, just define them on different com ports.  Define your internal
modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  You really
shouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using
both modems at the same time :).

Yes, I did punch in the wrong numbers (working too many late nites).  I

G'Day All,

I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM.

I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also.

I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save
an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer...

Any help would be apprieciated!

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

hi all,

IN SHORT: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing
	  on SVGA graphics.

COMPLETE:
	I am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
graphics program to write on PC or clones. (ball-and-stick type)

Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics
		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)

What I'm looking for?
1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.
   Presumably in assembly languagine.
	Yes, VERY FAST please.
2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
   text, else later.
   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the 
   project.

Final remarks;-
non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.

	Any help is appreciated.

Beware.  There is only one such *copyrighted* image and the company

Subject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)
Organization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand
Lines: 67

OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

This is almost certainly a MacBinary file which is an encoded version
of a mac file so the Resource fork and Data fork get preserved.
You need a program that converts this to a regular file. If this is a
macbinary file, you may have downloaded it in Text mode and is probably
corrupt (if you did). If you're using FTP to transfer it at any point make sure
you type ""binary"" first.

If you can open the file with a text editor and find
(This file must be converted with Bin....
at the top, it is a BinHex file and can be decoded with
BinHex 4.0 (among other programs).

Subject: Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ
Lines: 130


----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be ""HELP"" or ""USER name <passwd>"".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

Hi all.  I'm looking for datasets of a human body or head  in any
of the popular formats.  I'm doing a presentation tomorrow which
could be greatly enhanced by bringing in this 'human' factor.  I've
looked around the net with no sucess so far.  Anyone got any ideas?
I'd also appreciate info on the location of datasets for the
USS Enterprise (any model)
Thanks in advance,

Hi!
	I am working on a project that needs to create contour lines
from random data points.  The work that I have done so far tells me that I
need to look into Triangulated Irregular Networks (TIN), the Delauney
criiterion, and the Krige method.  Does anyone have any suggestions for
references, programs and hopefully source code for creating contours.  Any
help with this or any surface modeling would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Need help with Mitsubishi P78U image printer
Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA

NNTP-Posting-Host: sipi.usc.edu

Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Thanks.

That's closer, but I dislike ""apps"".  ""software"" (vs. ""hardware"")
would be better.  Would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  Or would
that be ""programmer""?

I don't know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup
split.  Look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).

It's true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing FAQs and
discussing things that would probably be better diverted to
system-specific groups, but I don't know whether a split would help
or hurt that cause.

Maybe we need a comp.graphics.RTFB for all those people who can't be

Hei Pei.

I can not help you directly width you problem, but there may be
intermediate roads to take to get to the IFF. I am using a converter
that can take IGES, IIF, DXF -> IGES, MILESPEC I IGES, MILESPEC II IGES, 
IIF, MILESPEC I IIF, MILESPEC II IIF  and DXF.

IIF is IBM IGES FORMAT. There may be converters out there that can handle
IGES to IFF. Hope this was to any help. By the way the converter is part
of the IGES Processor/6000 package from IBM and it runs on RS/6000 AIX.

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long
time ago.

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).

Organization: University of New Mexico, Albuquerque

Hi.  I'm writing a program to convert .dxf files to a database
format used by a 3D graphics program I've written.  My program stores
the points of a polygon in CCW order.  I've used 3D Concepts a 
little and it seems that the points are stored in the order
they are drawn.

Does the DXF format have a way of indicating which order the 
points are stored in, CW or CCW?  Its easy enough to convert,
but if I don't know which way they are stored, I dont know 
which direction the polygon should be visible from.

If DXF doesn't handle this, can anyone recommend a workaround?
The best I can think of is to create two polygons for each one
in the DXF file, one stored CW and the other CCW.  But that
doubles the number of polygons and decreases speed...

Thanks in advance for any help,

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there
a long time ago).

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.

Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has
to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing
on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:

* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future

* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,
but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better
output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to
program).

Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of

this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5
different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum

Just curious.

This image is copyrighted. Early in another news group it was being
used as a texture map in a planet orbiting simulation. That program
was being freely distributed but the texture map picture for the 
earth had to be pulled because of copyright infringement issues.

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of.
Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of.

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly.

When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.
When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities
they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)
they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point
by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
(4 points being colinear => coplanar)

Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points
has been found is trivial.

Yes, I have both Arts & Letters and CorelDraw.  I personally like
Arts & Letters better but there are things I like about Arts & Letters
that CorelDraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  I haven't found the perfect
graphics program that does everything yet.  

My favorite feature from CorelDraw is that it imports alot of different
formats.  Arts & Letters does not.  I like the thousands of clipart
available with Arts & Letters.  However, I do find looking them up
in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.

One of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
the market for the artistically deprived :-).

Yup.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a
8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as
far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)

Have a day!

I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just ""dodgy"".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!

There might be an IPAS routine that does that,but I can'r be sure.  Another
way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
image.  Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  It will
take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's
the only thing I can think of.

I have to beg to differ on this point, as the batch file I use

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

>>If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much
>>more powerfull software - which is readily available commercially.

In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:

>(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
>places so far.)

Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.

>You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this
""bug"" in the thread, so here goes:

It is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,
and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).

I would guess that it requires X, almost certainly DV/X, which commonly

On my SVR4 Amiga Unix box, I've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for

Unix Press, ie. Prentice-Hall, has a programmer's guide for these
tools, referred to as the FMLI (Forms Mgmt Language Interface) and
ETI (Extended Terminal Interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  It is
ISBN 0-13-020637-7.

Paraphrased from the outside back cover:

    FMLI is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
    and text frames.  ETI is a set of screen management library
    subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
    for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.

The FMLI is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
screen displays for data entry and presentation.  It consists of a
""shell-like"" environment of the ""fmli"" program and it's database
files.  It is section 1F in the Unix Press manual.

The ETI are subroutines, part of the 3X manual section, provide
support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
with controls built on top of the curses library.

Hi! Everyone,

Since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from
4 points, I suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse
from its offset. For example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find
the original ellipse analytically?

I spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,
but I failed. Under the pressure, I had to use other method - nonlinear
programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.

Any ideas will be greatly appreciated. Please post here, let the others
share our interests.

Playmation is available direct from Anjon & Associates for $299.  It's hard
to beat that price.  Also, you'd be better off with a newer version than
an older version that had bugs that have long since been clobbered.

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:

>We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a *lot* easier.

----------------

Eh? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is

paragraph defeats me.

Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.

But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:

>>>process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.

No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

>changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most

???
What are you saying
???

Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!

Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy, however.

Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
>designed for that.

As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.

>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 

Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?

>say,
>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
>expected that the image still is the same. 

Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.

>So, XV were designed
>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
>program work -- design error.

Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets
you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the
human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. It makes no false claims.

>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
>major change to the original design.

If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 
far, you have not done so.

>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

>Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where

I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else
had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

>Well, my text may be a bit hard reading,

Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly
thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think
some more.

You'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
in the new colours.

Use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range
from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the
range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).

Then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
the result should be ok.

You might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.

mapping.  Here's a simple file I was working with, could some kind
soul tell me whats wrong with this.....

#include ""colors.inc""
#include ""shapes.inc""
#include ""textures.inc""
 
camera {
  location  <0 1 -3>
  direction <0 0 1.5>
  up        <0 1 0>
  right     <1.33 0 0>
  look_at   <0 1 2>
}
 
object { light_source { <2 4 -3> color White }
       }
 
object {
  sphere { <0 1 2> 1 }
   texture {
     bump_map { 1 <0 1 2> gif ""surf.gif""}
   }
}

NOTE: surf.gif is a plasma fractal from Fractint that is using the
landscape palette map.

  
	Thanks in advance

Why didn't you create 8 grey-level images, and display them for
1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128... time slices?

This requires the same total exposure time, and the same precision in
timing, but drastically reduces the image-preparation time, no?

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

I am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user
being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.  Also,
the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so
that they can move around while the user is ""exploring"" the wireframe
world.

To do this, I am thinking of using the SRGP package described in the
Van Dam, Foley and Feiner book, but I was wondering if there was
another PD graphics package out there which was faster.  I would like
to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides
satisfactory real time performance on a Sun IPX.

Ideally, I'm looking for a PD graphics package which will allow me to
open a new window under X, and allow me to draw lines within the
window.  Also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven
interaction handling since the user is going to move around the
wireframe models using the keyboard.

If you know or wrote such a package, I would be grateful if you could
direct me to a ftp site which contains the package.

Thank you.

Subject: Please Help: Point in concave Polyhedra
Lines: 43

Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only
1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due
mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at
different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the
stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
  Example:
  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)
      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)

Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as
you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the
application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.
Bravo!

through proper channels so I'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)

Note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that
the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality.
Also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality
depends on them too.
 
This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.
 
IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing
errors in programs.
There's two errors:
  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the
   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of
   original 24bit should be a special case
  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer
   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the
   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier
   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases
   in saving the image, if at all)
 
==clip==

==clip==

[ ..deleted..]

It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.
It is error in design.
It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;
jpeg is not designed to that.

As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were
known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only
at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the
whole design should be changed to support 24bit images.
That were not done and now we have
 -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)
 -the program has human interface errors.

Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without
clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.

[ ..deleted.. ]

==clip==

Some new items follows.

==clip==

I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24
option than with default option we have.
The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)
the same than used in ppmquant.

If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found
that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv
(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly
-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.

I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.
So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.

I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in
rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.
(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I
can say nothing about it.)

==clip==

==clip==

Some minor bugs in human interface are:

Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens
that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong
place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about
five minutes and then it is gone away immediately.
The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.

Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard
and mouse for XV after the image is completed.
Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when
I'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings
then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.

In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV
updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first

Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:

   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge
   2) one's financial situation takes precedence
   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from ""fun"" to ""work""
   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for ""the hobby""

or the biggest killer (IMO)

   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's
      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without
      the motivation the effort seems useless.

Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems, our children
are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy
the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being
taught the ""user"" mentality.  As the number of us ""old-timers"" dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation.

Hi:

I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor.
It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is
sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these
non-linearities are ""Gamma-corrected"" before encoding NTSC signals
or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.
 
Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do
these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC
monitor? In other words does PC monitor display circuitry
correct for ""gamma errrors""?
 
Your response is much appreciated.

Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.
>
>Is there a color version of MGR for Linux?

>Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that
SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well
thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement
it.

If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently
getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well
enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get
a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

Summary: some CView problems explained
Keywords: Stupid Programming
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]

A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.
Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post
it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:

CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most
annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to
do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control
over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its
""current directory"".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)
when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView
doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems 
to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour
information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the ""dithering"", again writing
another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this
second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does
the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to
your screen again.  (It does this last ""recopy"" operation for its
""fit to screen"" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)

 The result of this process is the following:
  
     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all
        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of
        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never
        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.

     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for
        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the
        dithering and writes to the screen card.
        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data
        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)
        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which
        there was room on the disk.

This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general
idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details
about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient
disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be
very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess
of 6 Meg free disk space.


CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from
a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the
floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT
table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted
floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly
unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files
menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the
hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once
when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to
sort a directory listing?


With much thanks to the originator of this article.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.
   Written by Steve Worley.

[ What about Texture City ?? ]

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

c. Others:

[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

  For a free WIT demo disk, call, FAX, or e-mail (poon@ee.ubc.ca)

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the
  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview
-------
  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) 
  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

AT&T also puts out two new products for windows, Model numbers elude me now,
a 15 bit video board with framegrabber and a 16bit with same. Yesterday I
was looking at a product at a local Software ETC store. Media Vision makes
a 15bit (32,768 color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot
use the feature connector on your existing video card. It claims upto 30 fps
live capture as well as single frame from either composite NTSC or s-video
in and out.

Does ANYONE out there in Net-land have any information on the Cobra 2.20 
card?  The sticker on the end of the card reads
        Model: Cobra 1-B-1
        Bios:  Cobra v2.20

I Havn't been able to find anything about it from anyone!  If you have 
any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
card or know where any drivers are for it, PLEASE let me know!

As far as I can tell, it's a CGA card that is taking up 2 of my 16-bit 
ISA slots but when I enable the test patterns, it displays much more than 
the usualy 4 CGA colors... At least 16 from what I can count.. Thanks!

If this question is covered elsewhere, I apologize, but I need information
fast.

My department has been given a large sum of money to install a video system
on our network of IBM RS6000 workstations.  This is not an area in which I
have any expertise, so I wonder if anyone out there can offer advice.  We
would like a system, based either on VHS or 8mm video which will allow one 
write video, frame by frame on tape for play-back in real time.  It's for
visualization of physics problems.  Can anyone tell me what hardware is
available which would work for our system?  Some support software is
obviously needed too, but nothing particularly sophisticated, since the
software we actually use for the visualization is all already written.

Please email with replies, as I don't read this group.  Many thanks for your
help.

It is for a business and the end product has to be a photograph.
I take damaged black and whites, usually old, some very, and repair them
by hand at present.  I would like to do this by using a computer.
I am just trying to find a vendor who can convert my computer stored
images to negatives or thermal print.  The customer will want his/her

Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one
or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something.

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali
is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding ""transformation engines"".

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.


			3400			3500

CPU			DEC Alpha AXP 133MHz	DEC Alpha AXP 150MHz

Z-buffer		24-bit			24-bit
Alpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bit
Stereo support		yes			yes
Other:				both machines will double buffer or do
				stereo output per window.  Both have an
				auxiliary video output that is RS-170A,
				NTSC, and PAL

STORAGE

IO

Both have TurboChannel 100MB/sec, SCSI-2, Ethernet, and FDDI

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Both have libraries for Xlib, Motif, MIT PEXlib, DEC-PEXlib DEC-PHIGS, and GL

Okay, now the real stuff.  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They
use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their
capabilities are as follows:

			E		P		V

As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part
is the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information.
Their number is 408-727-8100.  I'm sure they'll send you an information you
may want.  Oh, some prices:

Low-end

Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S.

High-end

Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it.

Hope this helps someone out there,

Brian

PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any way.  Hell, I thought they made
tractors or something. :-)

I think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er)
Gates' and Jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a
phenomenom as it is now.  With the increased popularity of the PC
come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical
minded and narrower-focused programmers.

Why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or
programs for accountants?  Basically, the yuppies caught up and
disciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image.

Hi there

I am very interested in Rayshade 4.00. I have managed to make a chessboard
for Rayshade. Unfortunately I still have to do the knight (horse). Any ideas?
I am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. The board is marble.
Unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. Anybody with ideas
for nice surfaces?

I would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
command. Unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and I don't have
Craig Kolb's email address. Anybody with ideas, because this is essential
for my next venture into raytracing.

Where should I post the finished chessboard?

Is there anybody else using rayshade on non-Unix systems?

How fast does Unix render?

Thanks

Rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no
artistic talent.

[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,
    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has
    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.

NeXT:

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are
currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific
sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

There are several public domain utilities available at your usual
archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl
file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  The problem 
is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
the many pd format converters I have used. Any hint welcome!
Let me know if you have problems locating the utilities.
Hope it helps.

Hi,
  I need to know if there is a 256 color graphics mode that allows multiple
pages.  I want something like mode 0x10 (640x350x16 2 pages).  I have been
experimenting with graphics by calling the BIOS with borland turbo c.  I
feel like I am flying blind in this area, and could use all the help that
you can give.

  Thanks,
	Ivan......

I've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since I quoted it in my last posting). 
My gripe about TIFF is that it's far too complicated and nearly
infinitely easier to write than to read, which I think hurts your
acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g.,
paint programs).

In a nutshell, I don't think TIFF is salvageable unless the fat is
trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be TIFF anymore.  They
keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  Maybe they >will< fix it,
and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility. 
That would probably make me happy.

   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve
those for c.s.m.a :-) )

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a
booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture
using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
(1.5).

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite
nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by
3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he
increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know
what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.

   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was
from memory!

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some
hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the 
animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?

   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can
claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in 
my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer
low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, 
no longer CD-I.

I'm sure it is, and I am not amused.  Every time I read that part of the
TIFF spec, it infuriates me- and I'm none too happy about the
complexity of the spec anyway- because I think their ""arbitrary but
carefully chosen number"" is neither.  Additionally, I find their
choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why
not just use the letters ""TIFF""?

(And no, I don't think they should have bothered to support both word
orders either- and I've found that many TIFF readers actually
don't.)

According to the literature, it will do quadruple buffering so that you

library for programming in 320*200*256 VGA. We are currently producing it as
shareware, but in a few years it may be a commercial product (excuse typos,
there's no backspace on this terminal). Features include:

- loading and saving bit-images (called blocks from herein)
- flipping, resizing and warping blocks
- loading and saving palette, fading, several in memory at once
- graphics primitives such as line, circle, bar, rectangle
- region fill (not the usually useless floodfill)
- sprites (animated bitmaps), up to 200 onscreen at once
- joystick/mouse support
- SB support (VOC and CMF)
- tile-based game creation using 16*16 pixel tiles to create
  a 320*200 tile map (or game world) like in Duke Nuke 'Em
- number of sprites increased to 1000
- Professional Sprite Creator utility and Map Maker
-  routines to simplify scrolling games using maps, etc
- FLI playing routines, sprites can be animated over the FLI while playing
- PCX support, soon GIF
- EMS/XMS coming soon as well

Maybe. I've had an Epson portable with backlit LCD since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine. The only problem it
has (and ever has had) is the ""arm"" of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it
round a bit. But other than that, it's been perfect! So what's that,
about um, 60 months???!

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well
    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far
    exceed their technical skills.

    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression
    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and
    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the
    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of
    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar
    representions, a confounded user asks: ""What does it all mean?""

    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and
    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by
    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media
    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic
    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for
    composing imagery for understanding.

    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a
    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the
    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,
    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and
    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the
    computer graphics context.

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable
interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It
is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL
means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable.

If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI
sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a
shot.

|>

As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in
1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates
sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5
years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI
('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power
Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics
architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every
18 months to 2 years.

These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become
almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new
platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,
faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we
don't, we become uncompetitive.

From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep
for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as
the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge
R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.

Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule
slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our

Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor
technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at
least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is
really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.

There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,
we know it.

     If you have the GRASP animation system, then yes, it's quite easy.
You simply use GLIB to extract the image (each ""frame"" in a .GL is
actually a complete .PCX or .CLP file), then use one of MANY available
utilities to convert it.  If you don't have the GRASP package, I'm afraid
I can't help you.  Sorry.
     By the way, before you ask, GRASP (GRaphics Animation System for
Professionals) is a commercial product that sells for just over US$300
from most mail-order companies I've seen.  And no, I don't have it.  :)

I can convert them to Window Meta FIles easily enough, but I would rather

Can anyone give me information or lead me to electronic information (not
books; I'm too poor...) regarding programming the standard graphics modes?
320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough, but I'm not so sure about the
rest.  Something about planes or something, and writing to ports and the
like, but I don't know the numbers or anything -- for the 16 color modes, I
think.  If I'm wrong, let me know.  Also, 320x200x256 is just one byte/pixel;
that's easy enough, but are there any other ways to write to the screen,
perhaps bytes at a time, or something like that?

Of course, I'd appreciate any information about any mode....  which reminds
me of another question -- do the SuperVGA modes work the same, generally,
as the normal 16 and 256 color modes, or is not only the mode numbers
for various cards different, but the methods for writing to the screen
different as well?

Thanks for any help you can give me...  I'm developing a screen class for
C++ and find myself searching for information.  Oh, I do have Ralf Brown's
Interrupt List, which has given me tons of invaluable information already.
It just doesn't go into the screen programming details (except for the
read/write pixel BIOS calls...

Thanks again.

	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works
	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.

	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think

Subject: Hitatchi Raster Format (HRF)?

Keywords: HRF

 Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan and
subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. The problem is that
once the raster file is loaded into the CADCore package, a header is added
to the .HRF file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. We
would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for
further use on our workstations. So, here are my questions:

 (1) What is the Hitachi format? - I need this format so I can recognize
precisely what to strip out. I strongly suspect that it's a compressed
format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the
offending header.

 (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF? It would be
really nice to find some sort of ""hrftopbm"" converter out there. ;)

 I've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain
graphics formats documentation, with no luck. So, if you know, or knwo
someone who knows - please email! Thanks.

1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Archie servers:
  archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (Aussie/NZ)
  archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (Finland/Eur.)
  archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (GER.)
  cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (Israel)
  archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (JAPAN)
  archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (Korea)

  archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (New Zealand)

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.


+RED
+---
+  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server.
+  The Server Sites that are available are:
+

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes

  It's a spline based object modeller (""ICoons"" = Interactive 
  COONS path editor) in amiga.physik.unizh.ch (gfx/3d/ICoons1.0.lzh).
  It's free (under the GNU Licence) and requires FPU.

  The program has a look&feel which is a cross between Journeyman and
  Imagine, and it generates objects in TTDDD format.

  It is possible to load Journeyman objects into ICoons, so the program
  can be used to convert JMan objects to Imagine format.

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),

It is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline
algorithm, but not tremendously faster.  I spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  This is
all C (on HP PA-RISC the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as
fast as possible, as far as I could tell).  For any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  Definitely the
way to go.

p.s. sorry but my code CANNOT be made public domain....

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,
then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.

The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then
it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

My experience tells the second method is relible.

Hope this helps.

A book that I can somewhat recommend is :
                     
                     Pratical Image Processing in C
                     by Craig A. Lindley
                     published by Wiley

It addresses reading/writing to/from PCX/TIFF files; image acquisition, 
manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. The source is 
primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities. I 
have converted some of it to Quick C. Naturally, the code has some problems 
in the book - as usuall. Typos, syntax, etc. are problems. It can be a good 
learning experience for someone who is studying C. There is also a companion 
disk with source available for order and $50.00. Overall, the book is not 
bad. I acquired the book at WaldenSoftware.

I understand that Adobe is working on making Photoshop available for

Hi!

We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with
its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language
files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from 
whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language
seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language
that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps
something else ?

The question is, where can I find some information about this language ?
A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?

(OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT
optimistic...)

Thanks in advance for any help!

Yes I have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3D
modelling packages. Be warned, the data content is high and brings
many packages to their knees. We use it primarily for MicroStation
but it exports DXF, as well as other formats, so you should be OK.
You can get it from my FTP mirror site in the US.
It is

                                  OTG

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the
promotion of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method,
procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of
NAPLPS/JPEG standards.  These standards should facilitate the creation
of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video,
Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online
order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to
better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG,
FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and
EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.

We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2
platforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,
Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below.

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.

NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone

Illustrator for SGI is a shipping product. Adobe and SGI have announced that  
Photoshop is being ported to SGI machines. A simillar announcement has been  
made by Adobe and Sun for Sun platforms. No dates have been announced to the

Funny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
might be something to do with X-windows on PCs (? If you know, and have used
it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).

DV/X is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's Desqview/X
software.

I have not used DV/X yet, but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me, it
sounds pretty great:
	* allows multiple DOS machines - the way that OS/2 does, but without
requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS/2 going
	* pre-emptive multi-tasking
	* network computing - a proper X-windows client/server application -
this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your
network, and that X-windows programs can be used on your DV/X computer
	* although it is NOT a version of Unix, it effectively has many of
Unix's features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines. They also have InterNet support online (support@qdeck.com).

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works
very well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it
because of its complexity.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF
images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.

As the saying goes, ""It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the
>other<  assholes out there!""  I've had big trouble with misuse and
abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and
unnecessary) complexity of the format.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized
emphasis mine):

""The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),
and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be
able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many
image-generating applications out there now.""


If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF
image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to
deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not
that anyone does, of course! :-)

****************************   SPHINX   ***************************

	Sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing
and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance 
computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.

	It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote
sensing techniques. 

		   Intuitive Graphic Interface

	Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and 
point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and
analysis simple and fast.
	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image 
layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning
to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.

		    Image Format Compatibility

	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open
and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real
data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats
as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.

		    Image Analysis & Processing

	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an
assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and 
mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution 
product or principal component analyses.
An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows
the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.
Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig
onometric and transcendental functions.

		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis

	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity
for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).
The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and
surface conditions and instrument spectral bands.
A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,
and 3-D image projection.

		    Easy External Program Interfacing

	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally
developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite
observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters
to external programs using special interface functions.

		    Quick Quality Presentation

	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution
multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image
planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,
graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.
Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying
and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as 
histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale
output for standard inkjet and laser printers.
	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external 
graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?

		    Software Support & Development

	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)
 of the Universite de Lille, France.
The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at
the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),
and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).
At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing
research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features
on-line help, is supported by an Internet address

 sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and
 version updates provided without delay.

		    Performance Tested

 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data 
collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,
the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center
and is widely used in many French laboratories, including
the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,
Laboratoire d' Etudes et de Recherches en Teledetection Spatiale,  Laboratoire 
de Meteorologie Dynamique.


   A TEST VERSION OF SPHINX IS AVAILABLE AT loasil.citilille.fr
   (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd SPHINX : get ALL_SPHINX.tar.Z)

   IN THE TEST VERSION THE OUTPUT FILES ARE DISABLE. HOWEVER THE
   VISUALISATION AND GRAPHIC FUNCTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS IS
   SUFFICIENT TO WORK WITH.

   IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN KEEPING ""SPHINX"", SEND US YOUR EMAIL
   AND YOU WILL RECEIVE NEWS ABOUT THE PACKAGE EVOLUTION.

   THE SOFTWARE IS CHANGING WITH USER SUGGESTIONS WE WILL
   APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS.

No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to
suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the
Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My
comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors
that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.

What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.

I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a
previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around
for a while, rather than being flushed.

Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of
getting boned in the process.

Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we
aren't entitled to a ""peek under the covers"" as the Big Kids (NASA,
for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs
and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.
The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That
means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one
previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.
And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I
could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're
supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there
must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,
and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
back to 24 bit image.


>>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>>much more complicated.

Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.


About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global
changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit
image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
selecting individual color is possible from that.

Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...


>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
designed for that.
Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work -- design error.

I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
(Americans: the lift is just an example :)

Hi Noel,

I've made some attempts to write a converter that reads Adobe Type 1 fonts,
triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code
example of how to do it.

Another way to do the bartman may be

- TGA2POV
- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.

  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript
  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open
  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.

Example:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" }
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   texture {
      Glass
   }
   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ""ABP"" black on white in
Times-Roman 256 points.

Disclaimer: This posting does not necessarily reflect the opinions of NCR.
Lines: 16


I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures?

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.

I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
this.  Help, please!

Hi,

well I have opened up a FTP site for getting the latest software drivers
for Genoa graphics cards.

Here is how to access it:

ftp 192.109.42.11
login:ftp
password:ftp
cd pub/genoa
ls -l
binary
prompt
hash

(now if you wanna have the latest drivers for the 7900 board)

cd 7000series
mget *

quit

This is the sequence to get the drivers.

If you have any further question, please email me.

Best regards, Stefan Hartmann

Hi I'm new to imaging, and my advisor and I would like to 
do some 3D reconstructions.

We take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  Then
the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 
we want to save.  The outlines are stored as a TIFF file.

We would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 
3D image.  We are unsure as to where to begin.  Someone mentioned
that if we could convert the TIFF into a vector format then 
we could view them in Autocad.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Would be very pleased to see, what is going on in the field of research
and industrial development.

For those of you interested as well: There is a workshop (preferedly 
held in German), situated in Wuppertal, November 18/19 1993, specially
related to the above topic.
The title:

Sketch:  Rotate so cylinder axis is || Z axis.

Intersect X/Y projection of line with projected cylinder (similar to,
but easier than, sphere intersection).  Result: no intersection, one
intersection, or two intersections, parameterized along line by t0 and
t1.  Now look at Z, and compute intersections of line with top and
bottom planes of cylinder.  This gives t0' and t1'.  The interval of
intersection is then the bit of the line from [t0,t1] INTERSECT [t0',t1'].

Details left as an exercise for the reader.

If you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4
at least), there are at least two points at which the real Question is
implied.  Conversations proceed much like:

Zaphod: What *is* the ultimate Question, I wonder?
Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for
  the Infinite Improbability Drive): Think of a number, any number.

Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and
everytime it's arranged such that ""Think of a number, any number"" could be
an answer to someone's question about the Question.

I kind of like it.  Very mystifying.  It's not even ""pick a number"" or
""tell me a number"", just ""think of one"".

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision.

Try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.

Specifically ""JPEG Still Image Compression Standard"" by Pennebaker & Mitchell,
VNR 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.

BTW. I presume your comment about ""good"" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive
as it does.

Wrong...the major improvements for 2.01 and 2.01a are in the use of IPAS routines
for 3d studio.  They have increased in speed anywhere from 30-200% depending
on which ones you use.

All the Yost group IPAS routines that you can buy separate from the 3d studio
package require the use of 2.01 or 2.01a.  They are too slow with 2.00.

   Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of
   doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
   this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5
   different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
   a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
   for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?
   Just curious.

I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us
who are less omnivorous.  There is no ""waste"" in creating news
groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problem
with only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much time
on this as it is.

I don't know where Douglas Adams took it from, but I'm pretty sure he's
the one who launched it (in the Guide). Since then it's been showing up

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?

Subject: Raytracing Colours?
Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors
Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town
Lines: 25

I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.

When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first
the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and
the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).

The question is: 
  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
between 0 and 1.

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?

The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphics
chips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a little
fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in
Santa Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and Hal
Josephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. We
got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec
(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)
... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).

Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.

CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTime
does indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was stated
above... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size
then it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). The
price of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies
often, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick
on the latest 040 machines.

I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in
the 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?

G'day Brian,

I'll be blunt about this. The ONLY reasonable explanation of Roberts
algorithm is in

Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics
Rogers
McGraw-Hill Book Co. 1985

Go to the library and look at this.

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition
of Newman and Sproull.

The algorithm described in PECG runs in near linear time.

Hi there,

I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone
here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but
are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.

*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it
*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a
*** different version.

The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They
are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,
anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a
""virtual screen"", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with
no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a
simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256
color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three ""windows"".

The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip 
It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g

It is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with
it whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,
and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)

                FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24
          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-
          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-
          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-
          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS
          users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond
          PHIGS"".

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,
          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented
          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS
          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
          based on PHIGS.

          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to
          mainframes.

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
          and translucency.

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like
          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
          Radiosity support is also planned.

          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful
          ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-
          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-
          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-
          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-
          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or
          Starbase.

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows
          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request.

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-
          porates PEX support.

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the
          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.
          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

          tute of Technology.

          The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340
          workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.

          Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A
          Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics
          PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-
          ments.


          PHIGS USER GROUP

          The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS
          applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and
          PHIGS standards bodies.  For more  information  about  the  PHIGS
          Users Group, send e-mail to:

There are JPEG viewers that are windows based and therefore need no hardware
specific drivers beyond those provided in windows. I got mine from the Library
of Congress in connection with their online exhibit of books from the Vatican
library. See a previous message in this newgroup about that.

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question.  If not,
please forgive me and point me in the right direction.

Does anybody know of a program that converts .GIF files to .BMP files
and if so, where can I ftp it from?  Any help would be greatly 
appreciated.

Please respond via e-mail as I do not read this group very often.

Thanks...Scott

Here is one by Andrew ""Graphics Gems"" Glassner that I got from a
collegue of mine.  I think I fiddled with it a little bit to make it
deal with whatever bizarre problem I was working on at the time but it
is known to work.

I think APDA has something called MacWireFrame which is a full
wire-frame (and supposedly hidden-line removal) library.
I think it weighs in at $99 (but I've been wrong on an order

Wow! A 68070! I'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these,
especially considering the fact that Motorola has not yet released the
68060, which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-D

Ricardo, the animation playback to which Lawrence was referring in an
earlier post is plain old Quicktime 1.5 with the Compact Video codec.
I've seen digitized video (some of Apple's early commercials, to be
precise) running on a Centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely (16-bit
color depth). I would expect that using the same algorithm, a RISC
processor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,
though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly
dynamic material.

The best program I've seen for viewing such files is VPIC.  You'll want version 5.9 or later.  (6.0x is current.)  It allows you to view in 15 and 24 bit modes.  It really is QUITE nice.

Now, for a return question:  Do you run Windows?  If so, what are the dates on your drivers?  The newest ones *I* can find are from around 4-??-92!!  My problem is they conflict with Star Trek: After Dark, and other things as well.  I'm willing to bet that it's the drivers, and NOT the programs.  Anyone out there have info on newer SS24 (NOT X) drivers for windows or OS/2?

Thanks,

Sorry!! :-)

Call the four points A, B, C and D. Any three of them must be
non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface
of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either
they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).

A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC
and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.
This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.

Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points
on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in
fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane
containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any
plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles
to the ABC one.

Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference
of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the
normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular
bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is
not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).


Algorithm:

Is the sphere well defined?
    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).
    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).
    (3) Find the plane ABC and check that D does not lie in it (=> failure).
Yes. Find its centre.
    (1) Find the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.
    (2) Find their point of intersection (P).
    (3) Find the normal to the plane ABC passing through P (line N).
    (4) Find the plane containing N and D; find the point E on the
	ABC circle in this plane (if D lies on N, take E as A).
    (4) Find the perpendicular bisector of ED (line L)
    (5) Find the point of intersection of N and L (Q).
Q is the centre of the desired sphere

Numerically:

If ED << EP then Q will be very close to P (relative to the radius
of the ABC circle) and subject to error. It's best to choose D so
that the least of AD, BD and CD is larger than for any other choice.

:  [....] The narrower view that a hacker, when

:  expert is not so widespread, I'm my opinion, at least with the
:  people involved with the field. IMHO the wider meaning is not
:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to

:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody
:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very
:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know
:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]

Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark
recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view
given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.

I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
themselves such.  Following is the definition from ""Jargon File 2.9.10"".
(This is also known as the ""Hackers Dictionary"".)  The definitions are
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:

   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is
     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX
     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password
     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.

     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described
     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
     {hacker ethic, the}).

     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.

   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing
     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
     facilitating access to information and to computing resources
     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun
     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits
     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe
     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that
     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary
     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}
     project.

     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.
     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On
     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,
     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it
     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an
     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.

     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as
     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})
     can function without central control because of this trait; they
     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is
:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
: says ""Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..."" :-)

Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better
not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,
in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known
and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.

: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.
:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)

Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is
to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,
then language is working.

Or perhaps you write a freely available, GPLed unix for commonly
available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst
for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than
many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details).  Or maybe
you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation
and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom
so vital to continuing progress in our field.  Or maybe you start up
a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler
for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.

Some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals.  As for Bill Gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the PC market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the Annals of Computer Hackery.

As for me, I like running linux+X+countless other packages, without
paying a dime.  On the other hand, I have no problem purchasing motif
or other good software, as long as Microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
inept input.

My 2 cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. :-)

Some VESA bios's support this mode (0x100).  And *any* VGA should be able to
support this (640x480 by 256 colors) since it only requires 256,000 bytes.
My 8514/a VESA TSR supports this; it's the only VESA mode by card can support
due to 8514/a restrictions. (A WD/Paradise)

Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which
programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences
between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out
pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...

PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many
devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take
advantage of a 3D extension to X called ""PEX"".  PEXlib is a slightly
""lower"" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX
extension to X.

Some advantages of using PEXlib...
- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS
- Provides immediate mode capabilities
- Is free of ""policy""
- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support
  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).
  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.

Some advantages of using PHIGS...
- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones
- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output
- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier
- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you
- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.

If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like
archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that
both API's have a lot in common.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:

   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

  For a free WIT demo disk, call, FAX, or e-mail (poon@ee.ubc.ca)

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

SCRY
----
[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

Please send any comments to
        gvlware@ahpcrc.umn.edu

  (a specific format, easy to alter for the subroutine) on PC's.  My
  program has hooks into GKS.  If your friend has access to Phigs for X
  (PEX) and fortran bindings, I would be happy to share my evolving code
  (free of charge).  Right now it can display supercells of up to 65
  atoms (easy to change), and up to 100 time steps, drawing nearest
  neighbor bonds between 2 defining nn radii.  It works acceptably fast
  on a 10Mhz 286.

  developed a program to display an MD run dynamically on Silicon
  Graphics.  We are working to improve it, but it doesn't work under X,
  we are using the graphi. lib. of the Silicon Gr. because they are much
  faster then X.  When we'll end it we'll post on the news info about
  where to get it with ftp. (Will be free software).

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview
-------
  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) 
  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed ""movies"".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale ""movie"" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the ""movies"" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you
put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?

	Hi,

	I have a problem, I hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.

	Background of the problem:
	I have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 
	mapping of a 3d Bezier patch into 2d. The area in this domain
	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming
	loop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.
	For the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.

	My problem is this :
	The trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell
	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,
	else it is trivially rejected. 

	Does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 
	somewhere for doing this.

	Any help would be appreciated.

	Thanks, 
	Ani.

How does that compare with JPEG on the same images and hardware as far
as size, speed, and image quality are concerned?

Despite my skeptical and sometimes nearly rabid postings
criticizing Barnsley and company, I am very interested in the

There are several CRT-to-film writers around. Agfa has some, they also might
be called Matrix?, and I am pretty sure other companies sell the same
equipment. You might want to talk to any company in your area that does
presentation slides or offers graphics services. They should have those
machines and they might point you to a local vendor. From there on it's all
a question of money. They units are essentially high res CRTs plus a filter
wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.

Hi again,

Many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a MS-
Windows screen grabber.  It proves to me AGAIN that the net is a 
wonderful thing.  :-)

So, in summary:

There are two choices:

1)	Various screen grabber packages (Corel Draw has one, there are
a couple on simtel and cica).

2)	Use the built-in PrintScreen and Alt-PrintScreen functionality
to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  Then paste the 
clipboard to your application.  Cool!

Again, thanks for the info...

I was at an Adobe seminar/conference/propaganda forum/whatever-you-want-to-
call-it a couple months ago where they announced that Display Postscript was
going to be included in the next release of Sun's OS, (presumably Solaris.)
Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,
Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun.  Other than the
articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't
heard a peep about it.  I hope it's still in the works.

Acorn Replay running on a 25MHz ARM 3 processor (the ARM 3 is about 20% slower
than the ARM 6) does this in software (off a standard CD-ROM). 16 bit colour at
about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour
support, real-time dithering too...). The 3D0/O is supposed to have a couple of
DSPs - the ARM being used for housekeeping.

>I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM in

A 25MHz ARM 6xx should clock around 20 ARM MIPS, say 18 flat out. Depends
really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking ARM6x or ARM6xx
(the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with
slower memory).

I'll stop saying things there 'cos I'll hopefully be working for ARM after
graduation...

Mike

PS Don't pay heed to what reps from Philips say; if the 3D0/O doesn't beat the
   pants off 3DI then I'll eat this postscript.

Help!
How do you write to the second bank/page of memory when in VGA
320x200x256 colour mode?. ie: to perform page flipping animation
and buffering of the screen.
     I have tried using the Map Mask Registers, but this does not
perform the required task (Although it does do something).

Note: It *must* be able to work on a standard VGA (ie: not
necessarily a SVGA card).

           Cornell Theory Center Summer School
 
          Offered through the Cornell School of
        Continuing Education and Summer Sessions
 
                  Course Description
 
 Within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of
Lines: 197

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
 
Time:   Mon-Fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
 
Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow
         programming (DX), interactivity.
 
    Representing the atom
         size, time and energy scales
         basic classical and quantum mechanics
 
    Important categories of molecules
         small molecules, biopolymers, surfaces and catalysts,
         miscellaneous current applications
 
    Data formats and conversions
 
    Advanced molecular graphics techniques
 
    Types of simulation and experiment
         electronic structure, molecular dynamics/mechanics
         electrostatics, X-ray crystallography, NMR, quantum
         dynamics and spectroscopy.
 
Instructors
 
The course will be taught by two instructors. Topics related to computer
graphics will be handled by Dr. Bruce Land, Project Leader of Visualization,
Cornell National Supercomputing Facility. Chemistry-specific aspects
of the course will be handled by Dr. Richard E. Gillilan, Visualization
Specialist and Research Scientist, Cornell National Supercomputing Facility

You can include postscript epsi files in xfig (encapsulated postscript
info files). You can't actually edit the postscript file, but you're able
to draw over the postscript file.

There a eps to epsi converter: eps2epsi (perl program),

The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  It should also be on
the mirrors.  I think there is source for some applications that may have some
bearing on your project.  Poke around the source directory.  I've never used
this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-)

Subject: 3d GrafSys 1.21 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows:

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 1.21 now available. 

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free 
to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster.

Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

********

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.


Enjoy,
Christian Franz

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method
looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution
of linear equations).

To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,
P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2.
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points
(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like
I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to
find).

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define
the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel.

By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?
It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit
in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.

With 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,
this gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear.
With 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best
compinations -- there's 10 levels, but 16 choises; best 10 must be
chosen. Different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but
the levels keeps their order.

Readers should verify what I wrote... :-)

It is used to create a TIN (triangulated irregular network), which is
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of
points.  What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the 
most equalateral possible.  Check out ""Proceedings of AutoCarto N"" where
N is 8..10.  Sorry, I don't have a specific reference describing the
process.

A good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits / pixel
is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have
2 * 24-bit planes. You write to the one in the background, and then FLIP! 
-- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. The screen updates 
in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order 
that they're drawn (as in the CAD/MacDraw effect). Now your ready to update 
the image that used to be in the foreground.

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters. 
The polygons are all convex. 
They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave / self intersecting polygons. 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.

It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.

Does anyone know how to decode the color information of a NTSC signal ?

I need to convert this data to RGB for a Video Capture Utility I am 
writing for use with an IBM M-MOTION Video adapter card...

I need to know the how the V and U signals work in the color process.

Thanks in advance for any information or algorythms etc.

I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.

Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the
accompanying documentation:


                              DMPEG V1.0

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


0. Features
===========

DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:


 - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard
   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)

 - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display

 - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)

 - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale

 - color-space selection

 - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required

 - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)

 - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many Super-VGAs

...

4. Technical information
========================

The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].
The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]
(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero
coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT
(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to
use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).

Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to
+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed
over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas.

Organization: Moscow Scientific Industrial Ass. Spectrum
Lines: 137


       Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association ""Spectrum"" offer
       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of
       controllers.

                     SOFTWARE

            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit
       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.
            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for
       non professional users.
            There are next possibility:
       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;
       - read - white image to - from disk;
       - print image on the printer;
       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;
       - filter image;
       - work with gistogramme;
       - edit image.
       - include users exe modules.

                     CONTROLLER VS9

       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.
       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from
       a field of 724x600 pixels.
       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in
       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions.
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.

                     CONTROLLER VS52

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements, including user
       programmable gate arrays.
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
       devices).
       The controller has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;
       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixels ;
       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
       pixels;
       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024
       pixels ;
       - number of gray level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;
       - 4 input video multiplexer ;
       - input/output lookup table (LUT);
       - possibility to realize ""scroll"" and ""zoom"";













       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
       controlling signal) ;
       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
       digital converter;
       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.
       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
       controller by reprogramming it.


              IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100


            Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV
       signal in real time. It is possible digitize TV signal with
       512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation
       with two images.
            Processor was created on the base of modern elements
       including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board
       for PC.
            Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8
       format. It is possible to accumulate until 16 images.
            The processor has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume to 64 Mb;
       - number of the gray level - 256;
       - 4 input video multiplexer;
       - input/output lookup table;
       - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference;
       - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;
       - possibility color and black / white output;
       - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.

Organization: SQ Software via The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 31

I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature.
This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
looks better on low resolution devices.

The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They
also give an example of how to ""emulate"" strokeadjust in PostScript
environments where it is absent.

The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:

	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
	
Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in "".25"".  From
reading I thought that what they might actually do is:

	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
	
This results in all the coordinates ending in either ""0.25"" or ""0.75"" 
whichever is closer.

By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that
neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS
result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if
anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.

Thanks,

Hi !

If you want to have Soft-Scrolling on your VGA, you have to change some 
intern registers of the CRTC. But it is a little bit difficult to explain, 
so I would suggest, you take a look at ""The Programming of the 
EGA/VGA-Adapter"" by Addison-Wesley. You will find all useful descriptions 
for every available VGA-Register.

Get the generic version (for Unix and VMS) and build it. IMHO a
VMS .com file to build it is supplied.
As the distribution comes as .tar.Z you should either have uncompress
and tar on VMS or a UNIX flavoured machine handy.
Usually you won't find this on IBM-PC specific archives, but on the better
ones :)

I've had exactly the same problems in Aldus Freehand.  I think autotracing
is one of those ""features"" that barely works, but everybody feels compelled

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that
needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%
quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif!

I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any
standard format.  They simply contain the 8-bit pixel values.  I would
like to display these images on a PC.  The conversion to a GIF format
would be helpful.  This conversion can take place either on a PC
or on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC.
Can anyone suggest where I can find software to do this?  Alternatively, I
may have to write my own conversion program.  In this case, could someone
tell me where I can find the GIF format specification?

Please e-mail me directly at: shayla@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov

Thanks.

I am looking for some information of hidden line removal using Roberts
algorithm.  Something with code, or pseudo code would be especially
helpful.

I am required to do this for a class, due Monday (we have very little
time to implement these changes, it is a VERY FAST paced class).  The
notes given in class leave a LOT to be desired, so I would vastly
appreciate any help.

Actually any algorithm would be nice (Roberts or no).  The main problem
is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions, need to know which
lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another.

If you can give me an ftp address and filename, or even the name of a
good book, I'd REALLY appreciate it.

Thanks,

I think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  If

G'day all,

Can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/
display HDF image files ? I've had a look at the HDF stuff under NCSA 
and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage
approaches and minimalist documentation :-)

Part of the problem is that I want to look at large (5MB+) HDF files and
crop out a section. Ideally I would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from
which I can then use the PBMplus stuff quite merrily. I can convert the cropped
part into another format for viewing/animation.

Otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the NCSA Visualisation S/W
for HDF (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. This is for
Suns with SunOS 4.1.2.

Any help GREATLY appreciated. Ta muchly !

Cheers,
	Markus

You can use PBM's 'rawtopgm' to convert three raw (r, g, b) files to pgm format. Then you can use pgm3toppm to convert the pgm files to a composite ppm file,

Hello
	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very
much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. The subjects are

	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a
way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get
any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?

	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in ""mostly plain"" english how the vesa calls work.

	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,
I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both
gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where
are you, and why haven't you written a book yet? 

Please help

Thanks in advance

To draw polygons of course.  Its a VGA mode 13h (320x200) game, done in C and

I sure did use version 3.2. It works fine with most software but NOT
with Animator Pro and that one is quite important to me. Pretty

So I hope the author can fix that.

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,
I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main
file menu.  This may not be implemented in earlier versions,
of course, in which case you're on your own!!!

Also, I seem to think that the s/w for the QCR-Z (at the time)
did strange (and very undesirable) things if ANY part of the
pic was outside the screen area on Corel.  I once spent an
afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!

The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -
so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then
grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the
shape of the object being filled!!!

Of course, if the recorder isn't a QCR, you can ignore all
this and feel suitably :-)

Cheers, Toby.

   OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
   the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

   First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
   (for better or for worse).

   I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
   ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
   frames.

   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
   ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
   switching.

   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
   even more...

I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take
into account:

(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16
bit, but other depths are (of course) possible).

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for ""double size"" scaling, other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder).

(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size
is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference.

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...

It's really not that hard to do.  There are books out there which explain
everything, and the basic 3D functions, translation, rotation, shading, and
hidden line removal are pretty easy.  I wrote a program in a few weeks witht
he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.
	Also, Quickdraw has a lot of 3D functions built in, and Think pascal
can access them, and I would expect that THINK C could as well.  If you can
find out how to use the Quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent
choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the Mac, so should be
fast.

I have posted DISP140.ZIP to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.
I will upload this package to SIMTEL20 later.

******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
         if no fee is gained.
******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program.

Important changes since Version 1.35:
  Added support for IRIS.
  Support Mix/Concat. two images.
  Added support for 'batch conversion'.
  Added support for 'load/save palette table'.
  Added support for 'edge enhance'.
  Added support for 'crop one line'.
  Added support for 'negate image'.
  New color quantization option.
  Fix some minor bugs.

(1) Introduction:
  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)
  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts.
  Include simple file management system.
  Support 'slide show'.
+ Support 'batch conversion'.
  There is NO LIMIT on image size.
  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.
  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).


(2) Hardware Requirement:
  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.
  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).
  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).
  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

  Supported Wares:

  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
  * 80387
  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies
  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX

  Unsupported:

  * DPMI
  * Microsoft Windows

  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory
  model, SVGA graphics.


(3) Installation:
  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.
  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)
  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version)
  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

  All Read/Write support full color(8 bits), grey scale, b/w dither,
      and 24 bits image, if allowed for that format.


(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
      The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.
+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.
     (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site)


(8) Tech. information:
  Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho.
  Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91).
  Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain
    libraries.
  Compiled with DJGPP.
  You can get whole DJGPP package from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.
    For example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp


(9) For Thoese who want to modify video driver:
   1. get GRX source code from SIMTEL20 or mirror sites.
   2. For HiColor and TrueColor:
        15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768.
        16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010.
        24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018.


Acknowledgment:
  I would like to thank the authors of XV and PBMPLUS for their permission
    to let me use their subroutines.
  Also I will thank the authors who write Tiff and Jpeg libraries.
  Thank DJ. Without DJGPP I can't do any thing on PC.

    I do not know if I am hitting the right news groups or not, any help in
the right direction is more than welcome.  I need help finding a company
that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by Adobe Photoshop
and turn them into thermal prints or negatives.  I am looking for a place
as close to North Carolina as possible.  The images will be created on
a Macintosh Quadra 800 running Adobe Photoshop and will then be stored in
whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88M cartridges?

    The images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi
scanner then modified/corrected by Adobe Photoshop.  If anyone could help me
or even give me phone numbers to people who could I would be very grateful.

    Also if anyone else is doing what I am planning I would be happy to hear
from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
use and/or any peripherals or software.  It seemed the Quadra 800 would be
my best bet to modify photographic images.  I am planning on buying a Quadra
800 with 32Megs of RAM, a 510Meg Hard Drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17"" Sony

Hello, I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a
change to read this newsgroup very often.  Anyways for my senior project I need
to convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file.  Please I don't need anyone telling
me that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I
have heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone
knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction.

Any help greatly appreciated,
Matt Georgy

I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the
tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!)
included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert
bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be
imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap.
Result - the file is completely in Corel format and
can be SCODAL'ed no problem!

BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the
solution less than idea, is that the trace utility
spits out many more points than are necessary to
define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and
curves are both traced as many short segments.

So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to
image.

The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping
out the extra points by hand using Corel.

OUCH!
I've done it a few times :-]

>Jeff Lyall

As I say, if you don't mind the problems, go via the route...
BITMAP -> COREL (VIA TRACE) ->
HAND TRIMMING (USING COREL)!!! ->
COMBINE WITH MAIN COREL PIC (VIA IMPORT) -> SCODAL

Cheers,

I downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken
at 1/2 degree increments. The author (not me) wrote some c-code (included)
that read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. They
work very well and are not incumbered by copyright. They are at an aminet
site near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area...

I refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author (sorry, I
forget his name) created these images. The raw data is not included.

PC Magazine seems to be impressed with the ATI card in their most recent
reviews.  In the April 13th issue they rate the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro
(EISA version) as their ""Editor's Choice"".  They noted that the drivers
had improved since they tested the ISA version in January...

Check out Image Pals v1.2 from U-Lead (until May, special $99 intro price,

does screen grabbing, and allows all your image files to be calalogged into

I finally got a 24 bit viewer for my POVRAY generated .TGA files.

It was written in C by Sean Malloy and he kindly sent me a copy.  He
wrote it for the same purpose, to view .TGA files using his SpeedStar 24.

It ONLY works with the SpeedStar 24 and I cannot send copies since it is
not my program.  I believe the author may release a version at a future
time when the program is more developed.   He may or may not comment on
this, as he pleases.

Thanks to all who were helpful.

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),
  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or

> Does anyone out there have any experience with Figaro+ form TGS or
> HOOPS from Ithaca Software?  I would appreciate any comments.

Yes, I do.  A couple of years ago, I did a comparison of the two
products.  Some of this may have changed, but here goes.

As far as a PHIGS+ implementation, Figaro+ is fine.  But, its PHIGS!
Personally, I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level.  I also
dislike structure editing, which I find impossible, but enough about
PHIGS.

I have found HOOPS to be a system that is full-featured and easy to
use.  They support all of their rendering methods in software when
there is no hardware support, their documentation is good, and they
are easily portable to other systems.

I would be happy to elaborate further if you have more specific
questions.

Lines: 15

Hello,

Thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of
displaying 24 bit images. All the viewers like xli,
xloadimage and display are converting the 24 bit images
to 8 bit before display them on the screen.

What I really want is a viewer with make use of the 24 bit
frame/screen buffer (in our case, the Parallax one).

Thanks in advance.

Gilles

What kind of polygons?  Shaded?  Texturemapped?  Hm?  More comes into play with
fast routines than just ""polygons"".  It would be nice to know exaclty what

Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.
So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice.

Arno

Howdy...  I think you would be interested in Infini-D 2.5 for the Mac.  There
is no DOS or Windows version.  It's quite an amazing program.

""Some"" of the features:

*  Bevel Text
*  Timeline based animation sequencer
*  Realtime bounding box preview
*  Object linking
*  Phong Shading
*  Ray Tracing
*  Bounding Box shading
*  Wireframe shading
*  Ghourad shading
*  Flat shading
*  Anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high)
*  Environment maps
*  Quicktime support (wrap a QT movie around an object)
*  Procedural surfaces
*  Composed surfaces (for layering surfaces)
*  Alpha channel support
*  Import EPS, DXF, and Swivel 3D files
*  Export DXF and Swivel 3D files
*  Spline based animation
*  Animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff)
*  Object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too)

... And lots more that I can't remember right now...

Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering
packages.  I think you can get it for around $699 from MacWarehouse.
They also have educational discounts...

Well, hope that helps a bit.

See ya...

10 lined up underneath in the third line
9 lined up under neath in the fourht...



the problem is  given the center of any arbritrary hexagon, and a line with

Subject: AVI to FLC converter
Organization: Cognos Incorporated, Ottawa CANADA

I am looking for a small utility that will convert a Microsoft Video (AVI)
file to an Autodesk Animator Pro (FLC) file. Since AVIs also contain sound,
it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a WAV or VOC
file. Currently I'm accomplishing this by saving the AVI as multiple DIBs
using Video for Windows, then converting each DIB to a GIF, then loading the
GIFs into Animator. For the sound, I load the original AVI into WavEdit and
save it as a seperate WAV file. This requires too many steps to be productive.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.

          Thanks

	Anyone who thinks that TIFF is too complex hasn't dealt with

	which deal with TIFF are dedicated to these other issues rather
	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.

	Perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
	simpleminded formats such as GIF, PCX, and BMP, but to suggest
	that TIFF is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.

	That doesn't mean that GIF isn't fine, but don't even thing about

	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  FAX is nice,
	but it doesn't do color (and GIF doesn't do B&W all that well).
	JPEG is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.

	The advantage TIFF brings to the table is its ability to handle
	all these situations (and then some).  Naturally it's more complex.
	But I'ld rather propose TIFF imaging solutions over imaging
	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.

	You may find that TIFF is too complicated for your personal tastes
	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  The complexity

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it may require you to give it a ""cut"" though...)

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular
Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)
are ""developable"". In more technical words, a developable surface is
""locally isometric to a plane"" at all points.


Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:
whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g., M. do Carmo's book:

@Book{Carmo76Differential,
  author =      {do Carmo, Manfredo P.},
  title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces},
  year =        1976,

	What's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's
hardware.  I currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - Apple,
DEC, and SGI - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's
hardware.  Currently, it seems like SGI customers are pissed at SGI about
dropping support for the Personal Iris, DEC customers are pissed at DEC for
dropping MIPS support in favor of the new Alpha boxes, and Apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new Mac is introduced that's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought.  When I used to be a Sun customer
years ago, I remember people being pissed at Sun for leaving their 386
and 680x0 customers out in the cold when Sparc came along.

	What's really interesting is that from what I can tell, the MIS
folks in the basement with their ES/9000 don't seem to be pissed at IBM.
Why?  I have no idea.  Either IBM really does take care of their customers
better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
smaller vendors do.

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),

I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.

First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.

Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so
this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to
solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.

In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems
Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By
""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus
the original problem.

There are two small problems with this approach. 

	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.

	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
	other words, will it halt?

	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is
	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable.


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

   England.  (Sorry, I don't have an ISBN# for this).

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known
Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an
acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)

--------

From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)

Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this).

|And no, SIGGRAPH 93 has not skipped town -- we're preparing the best
|SIGGRAPH conference yet!

Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever
grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!

For example:

	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same
	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,
	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.

	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.

	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI
	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,
	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic
	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.

	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the
	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG
	also has doubled its membership fee.

What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it
sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,
like SIGGRAPH, all the ""plus"" services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%
increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%
inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?

	Ahh no.  Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is
307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but I
don't think it is a BIOS mode.  I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do
that either.  If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and
640x480.  That by definition is SVGA, though not very high SVGA.

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's 
TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very
well written. 

The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks.

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
just to figure out that if I just used the durned splines then 
it would work...

Yes, there are serveral programs which can convert font files (eq the Borland
fonts) to objects consisting of spheres, cones etc. 
I've used a program (forgot its name/place, but i can look for it) which
converted these Borland fonts to three different raytracers. Vivid, POV and
Polyray (which i like more (more flexibel/faster/use of expressions etc).
The program has a lot nice features.
So if interested give me a mail.

well, i have lots of experience with scanning in images and altering
them.  as for changing them back into negatives, is that really possible?
scanning and altering is no big deal. i don't know what types of
features you have in your version of photoshop.  but the one i use
(which, incidentally is on a quadra) has gallery effects and all types
of other neato stuff.
i'm just wondering why you would want to put your images back into
negatives, because once you print the image out-that's your print.
do you know what exactly your aim is in all of this?  like, are you
doing this just for fun, for a business, to gain more computer
knowledge, for a project you're working on....
otherwise, i guess i don't know if i'd be helping or not by posting info

Reply-To: LIONESS@ufcc.ufl.edu
NNTP-Posting-Host: maple.circa.ufl.edu


More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the
E&S Freedom.


Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.

------

Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market
penetration.

There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and
E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end
developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom
systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose
applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,
however, will remain much more flexible.

The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end
Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting
in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide
strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade
them separately as needed.

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide
this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.
Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics
data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable
solution.

Hope this helps,

Brian

I must agree.  There is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
already.  In addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
into one of these categories.

Also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
environment.

Printer model and specification:

Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)
ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)


Hello,

We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. 
We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The 
copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the
printer with the ""lp"" system using the parallel interface and can print 
postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in 
turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a 
publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts 
are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of 
programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript 
with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 
rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that 
acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format
and translating the image into postscript.

We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality 
pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the 
SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a 
warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without 
some assurance that the product will work.


Here my questions:

If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or 
parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?

Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the
limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on 
the printer?
 
The Big question:

Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?



Please email directly to me, I don't not read news on a regular basis. 
I will post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

1) ok, so I can view these wonderful pictures on my screen.  What's the best way  to get them on to paper?  Would it be possible to take it to Kinko's and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it?

2) I was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced

Yes.  Here's what you should do.

Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,
but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex
more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have
to be transformed at all.

Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither
plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.

Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts
of their budget allocated ""upgrades"", ""maintenance"", and ""new purchases"",
and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually ""leases"" and so
is the software.

Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and
designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 
Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types
upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and
depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies
the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,
payroll, etc.

Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every
engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)

If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica,
Maple,... I would like to ask you for the solution to the following problem.
I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified
symbolic solution. Is there a FTP-able package out there that can handle such

    I would like to solve the following ray - Bezier patch intersection

Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much
as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need
a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the
mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs.

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a
PC?  I must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this
must be saved in a file which I can read.  I haven't found any info on Alias
in the copy of the faq that I have.

I am involve in a Distant Learning project and am in need
of Jpeg and Mpeg encode/decode source and object code.
This is a NOT-FOR PROFIT project that once completed I
hope to release to other educational and institutional
learning centers.
This project requires that TRUE photographic images be sent
over plain telephone lines. In addition if there is a REAL Good
GUI lib with 3D objects and all types of menu classes that can
be use at both end of the transaction (Server and Terminal End)
I would like to hear about it.
 
We recently posted an RFD announcing the OTG (Open Telematic Group)
that will concern itself with the developement of such application
and that it would incorporate NAPLPS, JPEG, MPEG, Voice, IVR, FAX
Sprites, Animation(fli, flc, etc...).
At present only DOS and UNIX environment is being worked on and it
our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major
platform can be accomodated via a plaform independent API/TOOLKIT/SDK
We are of the mind that it is about time that such project and group
be form to deal with these issues.
We want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as
Simte20 and start putting together a OTG FAQ.
If you have some or any information that in your opinion would be 
of interest to the OTG community and you like to see included in our
first FAQ please send it email to the address below.

They need a hit software product to encourage software sales of the product,

There are some multi-media and digital television products out there already,
albeit, not as capable as 3DO's.  But are there compelling reasons to buy

How does the 16 bit color of HDTV work ? It can not be 5 bit Red Green and

******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
         if no fee is gained.
******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program.


Important changes since version 1.30:
    Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).
    Improve file management system (more user-friendly).
    Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.
    Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.
    Fix bug in GEM/IMG reading.
    Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.
    Auto-skip macbinary header.


(1) Introduction:
  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)
  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts.
  Include simple file management system.
  Support 'slide show'.
  There is NO LIMIT on image size.
  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.
  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).


(2) Hardware Requirement:
  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.
  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).
  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).
  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

  Supported Wares:

  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
  * 80387
  * XMS & VDISK memory allocation strategies
  * VCPI programs, such as QEMM, DESQview, and 386MAX

  Unsupported:

  * DPMI
  * Microsoft Windows

  Features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory
  model, SVGA graphics.


(3) Installation:
  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.
  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)
  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version)
+  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
+      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
+      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).
                 You can find vesa BIOS driver from :

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
+       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.
     (There is NO anonymous ftp on this site)

  Program (user interface and some subroutines) written by Jih-Shin Ho.
  Some subroutines are borrowed from XV(2.21) and PBMPLUS(dec 91).
  Tiff(V3.2) and Jpeg(V4) reading/writing are through public domain

Actually, IFF is a *format standard*.  It is not a picture file format, sound
file format, but there exist several formats that use the IFF standard.  The
IFF picture standard used by mostly everybody is a FORM ILBM (or just ILBM).
The only 3D IFF specification I know of is TDDD, which is used by Imagine and
it's predecessor, Turbo Silver.   It is possible that some of the other Amiga
packages use another *IFF* spec, but I don't know of any.  Lightwave will load
TDDD FORM's I believe.

Subject: Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings?
Organization: SCTC
Lines: 47

Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a
boat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set of
reference points whose true x,y positions are known.  

Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron
Danon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program which
converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click
the mouse.

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come
out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways
from the known true values.  This is understandable because the
scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,
scanner errors and what have you.

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""
adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, or
rotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.

So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm for
removing such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets of
points 

Reference(x,y) (the known true values)

DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)

DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)

what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to
DistortedData to remove the errors.

I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted
reference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3d
surface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to remove
the errors in the other data points.

Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,
pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?

Thanks,

Earl

Speaking of Psygnosis, they have licensed games to Philips Interative
Media International for CD-I.

The following was recently posted in a message in the CD-I section of
the Multimedia Forum.

""Seventh Guest has been licensed by Virgin Games to Philips Interactive
Media International for worldwide CD-I rights. Were also licensed to
P.I.M.I. Litil Divil from Gremlin Graphics (UK) and Microcosm from
Psygnosis (UK). Those three titles will be adapted on CD-I using the full
potential of the FMV cartridge, meaning, using the additional memory as
well as the motion video capabilities. Those titles have been negociated
in Europe but will be available worldwide.

Also, Lemmings 1 & 2 have been licensed from Psygnosis, as well as Striker
Soccer from Rage (UK).""

I don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
started (so don't expect your CD-I retailer to have them yet).

There was also some mention of future Nintendo CD-I games in an issue of the
UK magazine ERT - Mario Hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels.

Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:

	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width. 
	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

Hope this helps.

    The gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the Aminet sites includes a
    utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for HamLab that can handle
    the most commonly used kinds of .PIC and .CLP files.

    The biggest problem is that the .CLP files don't usually contain a
    palette, so you need to convert a .PIC with the right palette
    first (which creates a ""ram:picpal"" file), and then convert the
    .CLP files.

I seem to remember that Xloadimage can do 24 bit servers too.

Possibly xwud the x window un-dump program can display 24 bit images; certainly

No.  As I recall, the only differences are in the 3ds.set parameters - some
of the defaults have changed slightly.  I'll look when I get home and let
you know, but there isn't enough to actually warrant upgrading.

A 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100
bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.  The Phillips
rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3DO players are
already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the
commercial release date.

By the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of
3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  Chip
sets will be in full production.  The number of software companies
designing titles for the box will be over 300.

How do I know this?  I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters
last week.  Some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about
company business.

What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and
the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which
requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns
whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn
method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several
comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the
transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My
method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of
something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so
merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are
looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this
method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

Hughes, to obtain text errata and information on distribution of the
software packages described in the book.  Also, users can send the
authors feedback, to report text errors and software bugs, make
suggestions, and submit exercises.  To receive information describing
how you can use the mail handler, simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu

the various volumes (Gems, GemsII, GemsIII), and get the README file first.

Errata to _Graphics Gems_ and _Graphics Gems II is available on
wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics/graphics/books.

A list of computer graphics, computational geometry and image processing
journals is available from Juhana Kouhia, jk87377@cs.tut.fi.


2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose
explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:

The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book is certainly
a good start.  Chapter 6 is ""Viewing in 3D"", then read chapter 15,
""Visible-Surface Determination"".  For more information go to chapter 16 for
shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.


3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.

Find a copy of ""Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display"" by
Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other
algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).

A variant method is described in ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293.  Note that
the code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is all available from an FTP site,
as described above.

Check out John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual.

The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as ""doing a better job than the
other algorithms, but slower"".

There's also an implementation of:

Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data
Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),
pp. 153-162.

avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,
in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.


4) Converting color into grayscale.

The NTSC formula is:

    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue


5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.

The only reference you need for this stuff is:

    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6

But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to b&w conversion.


6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,
loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*
transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.
This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one
2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing
sub-pixel sampling.

However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,
which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation"", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics
Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) under the original title.


7) Free image manipulation software.

There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus
the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.
Here are pointers to some of them:

    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format
    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing
    of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file
    contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

    PBMPLUS, by Jef Poskanzer.  Comprehensive format conversion and image
    manipulation package.  The latest version is always available via
    anonymous FTP as ftp.ee.lbl.gov:pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/packages/pbmplus/pbmplus*.tar.Z,
    and export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/pbmplus*.tar.Z.

    IM Raster Toolkit, by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.uwaterloo.ca).
    Provides a portable and efficient format and related toolkit.  The
    format is versatile in supporting pixels of arbitrary channels,
    components, and bit precisions while allowing compression and machine
    byte-order independence.  The kit contains more than 50 tools with
    extensive support of image manipulation, digital halftoning and format
    conversion.  Previously distributed on tape c/o the University of
    Waterloo, an FTP version will appear someday.

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could someone
mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for
details on some.

Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this.  You may find useful information there.


8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.

You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the
format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.
This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object
formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark
Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,
neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most
often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images
but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.



9) Converting between vector formats.

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw
to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you
get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects
are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.
The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled
round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.
Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do
a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.
A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.

On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive
site.

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to
X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can
be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the
answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial.

GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements
essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
and level 2).


10) How to get Pixar films.

The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available
on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:

    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price
    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00
    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00
    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00
    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00
    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00

All tapes are on 1/2"" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also
available:

    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00
    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)

For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for
each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H
for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add
$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,
213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify
prices and availability.  Or, just write to:

    Direct Cinema Limited
    1749 14th Street
    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342

Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:

At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly
more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's
available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).

    Pixar
    1001 West Cutting Blvd.
    Richmond, CA. 94804
    (510) 236-4000 
    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)

You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's
Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" and ""Knicknack"" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They
will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I 
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect 
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.


11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?

The short answer is, ""You can't.""  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,
but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to
do the job right, consult the article:

  ""A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles""
  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller
  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,
  September, 1989, pages 48-56.

For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:

  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture
  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,
  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.

For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:

  ""Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves""
  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken
  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),
  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]


12) How to order standards documents.

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.

Some useful numbers to know:

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI
Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;
for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.

Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let
you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering
at 1-800-854-7179.


13) How to FTP by email.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" and it will tell you how to use
it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.


14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,
the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in
Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including
treatment of special cases.

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,
if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.

Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in
the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:
pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.


15) How to tessellate a sphere.

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>
has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.
It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.

Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:

Highlights of this edition-

    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through
       November '91;
    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG
        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;
    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;
    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;
    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.

The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.
Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named
""speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z"" and is compressed at most sites-

             Site                             Dir
	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/
	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/
	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/
	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics
	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/

Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global
illumination bibliographies.  These are in ""refer"" format, and so can be
searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is
included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the
sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at
princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as ""RayBib.*"" and ""RadBib.*"".

Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray
tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially
in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This
collection is available at most of the sites above as ""rtabs.*"".

17) SIGGRAPH information online

[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]

ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org
(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both
anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.

The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes
both conference and publications subdirectories.

To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to
     archive-server@siggraph.org
and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with
the command
     send index
which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.


18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available

[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]

ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings
at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available
in three formats:
     text   (ASCII)
     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)
     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)
They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:

(1) by anonymous ftp
    change to one of the directories
       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]
    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word
    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary 
    mode.

    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the
    contents of each panel file.

(2) by electronic mail
    send mail to
       archive-server@siggraph.org
    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you
    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages
       send panel91-txt index
       send panel91-rtf index
    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary
    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.


19) Graphics mailing lists

There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each
covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing.

Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you
would like to see added.

20) Specific references on file formats

    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill
      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,
      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.  Comments - 26 formats, no software
      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).
      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.


21) What about GIF?

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the
keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like
it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question
which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.

Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info
Subject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info
Newsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,
	alt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,
	alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers

Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from
pit-manager.mit.edu in the files:

/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail
message containing any or all of:

send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1
send usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2

Send a message containing ""help"" to get general information about the
mail server.

Also, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and
20 above for more information.


22) What is morphing?

Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.
Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au
in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:

        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)
        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)
        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)

The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards.


23) How to ray-trace height fields

Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,
such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they
get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be
located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.

The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:

F. Kenton Musgrave
Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields
July, 1988
<musg88.ps.Z>

This is available as ""Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639"" from Yale University,
it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and
Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:

    nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    weedeater.math.yale.edu	pub/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    princeton.edu		pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z
    coral.cs.jcu.edu.au		graphics/papers/musg88.ps.Z
    gondwana.ecr.mu.OZ.AU	pub/papers/musg88.ms.Z and musg88.ps.Z

An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.

Another paper exists:

24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon

	The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is
clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.

>From Ronald Golman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above), ""Area

The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is
given by

     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |

where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x

operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal
to P0.


25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH

Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.
Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.
Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,
Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)

SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for
Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions
on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or
Associate Members.

If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you
$59.00 (no student discount).

I get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to
deal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).

Here is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.

This might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

That's a typical claim, though they say they've improved
compression speed considerably.  Did you find out anything else
about the book?  I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me
any pointers.

Reportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used
that marvelous piece of hardware called ""grad students"" to do the
work.  Supposedly it's been automated since about 1988, but I'm still
waiting to be impressed.

I use Arts & Letters on a PC and if you make use of the Tracing Preferences
it traces beautifully. BUT - there's a trick to tracing. I've traced entire
cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to
the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases
a lot of work). You need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it 
together... it's kinda hard to explain in type, but if you're ever in Reno
I can give you a little demonstration!

The RS6000 compiler is so forgiving, I think that if you mixed COBOL & pascal

Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which
won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.

Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!

Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same
direction.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use
the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making
sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a 
set of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that 
have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What's the
best way to realize that face is ""flipped"", and should have it's points
re-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized
that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise
order for a 2d polygon.  I'd like something for 3d data.

Any hints, tips, references would be appreciated.

This past week I've been playing with some of the R-D (Reaction-
Diffusion, not to be confused with RDS or R&D) techniques
from SIGGRAPH '91.

I was wondering what material is available to explain the control
mechanism a little more.  It seems to me very much like a matter of
picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting.  Although
both of the papers (Turk and Witkin & Kass) were very well organized
and extremely helpful, I guess what I need is a more basic description
of the technique, especially wrt the control mechanisms.  The tests
that I did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become
unstable.

Is there any info available online?  Source code would be great but
not necessary.

Thanks!

	Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 
	Contest Announcement)

WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?

ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR 
gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications 
such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, 
Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC.

The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 
systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-
platform use of the same device.

ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:
=====================================

ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty.
ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single 
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus 
data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.

ACCESS.bus Physical Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware 
protocol, with one data line and one clock line.
Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level 
handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization.  

ACCESS.bus Software Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.

I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, 
framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver.  

BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the 
ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with 
additional semantics, including checksum.
Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot 
plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running, without rebooting.

APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: 
keyboards, locators, and text devices.

ACCESS.bus support on the PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the 
PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  
An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 
- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for 
multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and 
Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples 
of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

	---this file last updated..4-21-93---


WHAT IS OTIS?

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
and distribution.  Digital immortality.

The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
there...and someone will dig them up.  
 
If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is 
breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
 
Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what they're here for.

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE?             

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  
 
 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site
		
	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 
	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)

Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin""
command to make sure you're in binary.

OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North
America....the following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff...
	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?
              
What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put
it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,
it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works
are also welcome.

OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  
GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  
you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format. 

OTIS also accepts animation files.      

When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
emailing).

If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send
copies to:

The OTIS Project
c/o Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha, NE 68124-1113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  
Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named, include those as well.  
 
Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
contact me and we'll arrange things.

If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5""
disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,
but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or
JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
not have to.

At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
get a slab-o-OTIS.

As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
Email me for current archive size and directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION?

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images.  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

USE?

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for    
the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the 
Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email
me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact information.
 
When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING IMAGES?

Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep
the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number.
Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CREATING IMAGE FILES?

When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,
address or other information you'd like people to know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

HMMM?!

That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed.
Your input is expected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  
 	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,
	     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations
	     however.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original 
 	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  
	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone
	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  
    	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS
	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights
	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 
	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 
	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     
	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is
	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or
	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 
	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        
	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific
	     permission for this sort of usage.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember, the operative term is ""stimulate"".  If you know of people
that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm
in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...

And, it does support all the way up to 1024x768. The biggest complaint I

Well, there *is* the standards document.  From the FAQ:

12) How to order standards documents.

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.

Some useful numbers to know:

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985. ...

nifty.

This is a heavily edited/modified version of the Gopher FAQ intended to
give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
client and jump into Gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained
as described below.  Once you have a gopher client point it at 
merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!

Common Questions and Answers about the Internet Gopher, a
client/server protocol for making a world wide information service,
with many implementations.  Posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, 
comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.

The most recent version of this FAQ can be gotten through gopher, or
via anonymous ftp:

rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq

Those without FTP access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
with ""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body to find out
how to do FTP by e-mail.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
List of questions in the Gopher FAQ:

Q0:  What is Gopher?
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins for Gopher?
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?
Q7: What is veronica?
Q8: What is Available for Biology?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q0:  What is Gopher?

A0:  The Internet Gopher client/server provides a distributed
     information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide
     information system (CWIS) can readily be constructed.   While
     providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  Gopher
     facilitates access to other Gopher and information servers
     throughout the world. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1:  Where can I get Gopher software?

A1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Look in the directory
     /pub/gopher

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2:  What do I need to access Gopher?

A2:  You will need a gopher ""client"" program that runs on your local PC
     or workstation

     There are clients for the following systems.  The directory
     following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
     ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
     /pub/gopher.

      Unix Curses & Emacs   :  /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher1.12.tar.Z
      Xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xgopher1.2.tar.Z
      Xwindows (Motif)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/moog
      Xwindows (Xview)      :  /pub/gopher/Unix/xvgopher
      Macintosh Hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher/old-versions *
      Macintosh Application :  /pub/gopher/Macintosh-TurboGopher *
      DOS w/Clarkson Driver :  /pub/gopher/PC_client/
      NeXTstep              :  /pub/gopher/NeXT/
      VM/CMS                :  /pub/gopher/Rice_CMS/ or /pub/gopher/VieGOPHER/
      VMS                   :  /pub/gopher/VMS/
      OS/2 2.0	            :  /pub/gopher/os2/
      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client ""The Gopher Book""
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      A Macintosh Application, ""MacGopher"".
        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *

      Another Macintosh application, ""GopherApp"".
        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *

      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP
        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe

      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS
     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe

      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace
      for DOS
         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE


     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:

       Type=1
       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       Port=70
       Path=
       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.

 
     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory.


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more
     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?

A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag.

     Telnet Public Logins:

     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area
     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------
     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America
     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America
     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America
     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe
     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia
     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden
     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America
     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador
     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.



---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?

A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  

     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world.

     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
     count. 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St. SE #190
      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at:
 
      +1 (612) 625-6817

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?

A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 
     
       - Search local WAIS indices.
       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?

A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7: What is veronica?

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 
     Computerized Archives.

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol.

     To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:

     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 
     Type=1 
     Port=70 
     Path=1/veronica 
     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q8: What is Available for Biology?

There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as 

   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2

This equation can be rewritten into the following form:  

   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1

For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.

The best fitting sphere will have 
- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)
- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.

A very good modeling package I found is `irit' (look for irit.tar.Z).
However there is no converter from it's format to POV format. I postet 
a request for such a converter in this group but got no response,
so I'm considering to write such a program myself.

is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'.

Basically, the program must draw a diagram of a FSA from a textual grammar,
showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between.

The problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the

Keywords: ellipse


Hi! Everyone,

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess
my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere.

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold
internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most
importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated. Please give me a hint.

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.
However, so many people involved in the problem ""sphere from 4 poits"".
Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
summary of the answers).

Subject: Advice sought: Turning font outlines into renderable polygons
Organization: CSRI, University of Toronto
Distribution: na
Lines: 53


I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or
TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted
by a 3D scanline renderer. 

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but
have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the
opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have
some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.

The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to
turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle
complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple
polygons). For example, in the letter ""O"" there are two outlines:

	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)
	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.

One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply 
connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the
two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a ""polygon with
holes"". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior
polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.

I do not want to use this simplistic system since:

	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple
		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for
		some fancy fonts).
	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.

From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid
decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as
is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal
polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.

My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into
polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution
since it creates excess number of polygons.

Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create
bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these
subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.

Thanks for any pointers.

I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective, similar to

similar to the following:

                         xxxx    xxxx
                             xxxx

The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move
around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]

Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded
for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope
of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).

I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:

1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a
packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the ""jaggies.""  I'm
now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).
Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,
thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?

2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.
Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape?

Currently I take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produce:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.
Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.
This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But
it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?
Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed?

Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?
I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.
Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.

[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.
This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this
approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing.

Hopefully the ""context"" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches
hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

Thanks in advance for any help.

Hi,
It might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
But usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either Unix or DOS- PC ).
So I'm not much interested in Amiga news. 

In the case of Software, I won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
newgroup to run on a Unix- platform, so I'm not interested in this information.

I would suggest to split the group. I don't see the problem of cross-posting.
Then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. 

BUT WHAT WOULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE A FAQ. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
TRAFFIC A LOT.

Sincerely, Gerhard

14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily
  extensible through ""script"" (or indirect command) files. These script
  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are
  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.
  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame
  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides
  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.""

Satellite Image Workshop
------------------------
  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all
  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-
  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't
  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1

  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.""

  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  starter program except for the obtuse manual""

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called ""Imagine32""
  or ""Image32"" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. 

PC Vista

  A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to
  comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to
  alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few. 

LABOimage

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  ""We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

	Getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape
is harder than it looks.  The standard VGA and EGA outputs are 
very different than the NTSC format used by televisions.  While
there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to
get your hands on and costs quite a bit.

	If you have access to an Amiga computer, that has an
NTSC output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by
modem and tape them from the NTSC output.  Unfortunately, this
would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy
animation unless you had a good Amiga animation program.

	Otherwise, see if your local public access cable
station has equipment that you can use.

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that
making several modifications to the RGB sliders is slow because of screen updates.]

In reverse order:

1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then
click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you
look carefully.

2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must
save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it
saves out 8 bit images - of course!

XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy
facility, not a bug.

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group
'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated.

If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull
software - which is readily available commercially.

And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space
;-)

Hi there,

I'm looking for help on hi-rez CGA modes (hey, i know it sounds crazy but at
the moment it's got to do). My card's manual says it does something like
640 by 400 2 colour and 640 by 200 4 colour (the card has 64k memory). Could 
anyone give me some help on how to implement these modes (Assembly language 
is fine). Any other usefull tips on the CGA regs will also help.

Thanx in advance...

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 

Please post or mail any answers or comments.

Subject: Need help: Z-buffering lines & areas together
Organization: Applicon, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI (USA)
Keywords: Z-buffer, roundoff, lines, areas
Lines: 84

I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different
PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's
_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).

I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,
hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and
are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in
comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above
Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)

The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching""
artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will
differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values
across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the
Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one
for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The
result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e.
smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed
to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.

I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).
Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z
component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more
or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through""
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital
workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test
program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;
this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX
5.1.

Open questions:
    (1) Why does this happen?
        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?
        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
            could be corrected for?
        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
            interpolators?
        --  Something else?
    (2) What to do about it?
        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
            in Z-buffered HLHSR?
        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
            artifacts?
        --  Am I just out of luck?

Any help would be immensely appreciated!

Subject: Tangent vectors of Kochanek-Bartels splines
Organization: University of Trondheim
Lines: 33

I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame
positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm
using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x,y,z).

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain
- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation
error...)

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
I'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
  iharkest@lise.unit.no
Anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
the replies if they contact me.

Originator: abrodnik@watdragon.uwaterloo.ca

This is an invitation to send articles to the Informatica magazine.
The first fully international issue has been published and echoes 
are quite favourable. For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). 

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,

 I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the

The image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)
and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public, rather than pure research.

Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I

Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects
for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer
graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics
would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
per second).

It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations.

Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15
frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general
does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the
UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. 
Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time
operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not
even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our
multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due
to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.

From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2
systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly
important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.

You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are
off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most
popular are (in no particular order):

	- Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS
	- Sens8 Inc.		    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit
	- Naval Postgraduate School (Monterey, CA)     - NPSnet (FREE!)

	- Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks
	- Silicon Graphics Inc.	    (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer

There are some others, but not off the top of my head...

RIX's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a RAW file with
a 256 color palette.
The first 10 bytes is a kind of header, with the name RIX among 7bytes unknown stuff. The you have 768 bytes of palette info (3*256 for the colors RGB)
and then you have the picture in raw format.
If you dont know how to make a viewer of of this description you can get VPIC

My test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up.
Scaling was a very CPU-intensive operation with the original QuickTime (1.0);
the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),
but even so, I'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as
with playing back an actual 320*240 movie. I haven't done any numerical
measurements for scaled playback.

Yes but a key issue is _SPEED_ how fast is Imagine? And is it as easy to
use
as 3D Studio? Can it just do a render as fast as 3DS if you don't want
things like IOR etc.. 3DS can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,
animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the IPAS routines 
(Not that I've ever seen them) It can do explosions, top quality
morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..
I'm not knocking imagine, I just want to know how it compares with 3DS

    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about
this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest
that the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to Ray
Tracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.

    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For
example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you
get some illumination equation like this:

        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less
hand-waving illumination equation is this:

        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt

    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purple-colored glass object.

    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination
equation sermon"" to you also.

Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,
calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I
just question whether you >should<.

The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That
has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't
think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.

I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I
really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.

> There is one other thing that fractals are good for:  fractal

Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal
compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so
great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,
I'll wager.

Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression
work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable
alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)

I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I
don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their
sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a
real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,
right?

	""There are always going to be questions until there's a product

I don't know about that...I've used Photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a Quadra
950...I'd say they are roughly equal.  If anything the 486 was faster.

Both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of RAM (16 megs)
I also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators.

There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at
asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace.
Check the README file.

RTrace now can use the SUIT toolkit to have a nice user interface.
Compile it with -DSUIT or modify the Makefile.
SUIT is available at suit@uvacs.cs.virginia.edu
I have binaries of RTrace with SUIT for SUN Sparc, SGI Indigo
and DOS/GO32.
Please contact me if interested.

****************************************

The MAC RTrace 1.0 port is in directory pub/RTrace/Macintosh
Thanks to Reid Judd (reid.judd@east.sun.com) and
Greg Ferrar (gregt@function.mps.ohio-state.edu).

****************************************

Small changes were done since version 8.1.0, mainly:

1. Now it is possible to discard backface polygons and triangles
   for fast preview...

2. The support program scn2sff has been reworked to use temp files.

****************************************

Here goes a short description of current converters from
CAD/molecular/chemistry packages to the SCN format.

The package programs are related as below (those marked with * have been
modified)

The DOS port of RTrace is in pub/RTrace/PC-386 (rtrac820.arj,
utils820.arj and image820.arj). See the README file there.
Requires DJGPP GO32 DOS extender (version 1.09 included), which can be
found in directory pub/PC/djgpp (and in many sites around netland).
There are also demo scenes, manuals and all the source code...

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the promotion
of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method, 
procedures,algorythms,
applications, implementation, extensions of NAPLPS/JPEG standards.
These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online
applications that make use of Voice, Video, Telecommuting, HiRes 
graphics,
Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online order entry, Fax,in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML,CALS,
ODA,MIME,OODBMS,JPEG,MPEG,FRACTALS,SQL,CDrom,cdromXA,Kodak PhotoCD,TCL,
V.FAST,EIA/TIA562,can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications....
 
We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2 
platforms.
It is our hope that individuals,developers, corporations, Universities,
R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already 
many
corporation have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so do not 
delay joining if you are a developer
 
An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be 
be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject.
If you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to
the address below. 
 
This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG newsletter
as well as a hardcopy version.
We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications
& the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W,  decide to join and mutually benefit from 
this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.
 
NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

I've tried compiling it on several SPARCstations with gcc 2.22.  After
fixing up a few bugs (3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
other things) I got it to compile & link, but after starting client
& server I just get a black window; sometimes the client core dumps,
sometimes the server, sometimes I get a broken pipe, sometimes it
just sits there doing nothing although I occassionally get the
cursor to become a cross-hair in dog-fight, but that's it.  I've
sent word to the author plus what I did to fix it last week, but
no reply as yet.

   not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call
   an X viewer, I figure that the majority of the users here are not
   in an X11 environment - instead using DOS and MS-Kermit.

      With Kermit supporting Tek4010 emulation for graphics display,
   does anyone know of a package that would allow a Tek to display a

   plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of
   XView or XLoadImage ...

I recently got a document describing the JPEG FIF (JFIF) file
format. I was looking thru it, but I didn't get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image.

How do you get the height and width of a JPEG in a JFIF?

How do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture?

I wrote a small tool (lsgif) for GIF that returns the
filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks. The output looks like this:

  157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248C24

I use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
JPEG are getting more and more popular I would like to have a
similar tool for JFIF, with an output like this:

   57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     C24

Please respond by email, because I don't read this news

Keywords: 3-D widget, manipulation, feedback, user interface design system

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would
like to have in your applications.  

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 
application.  It may let you

- manipulate application data, the camera,
  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or
- view the status of the application or 3-D objects
  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.

For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.


Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information
I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.
Your help is very much appreciated.

The equation of the sphere through the 4 points (x1,y1,z1),...,(x4,y4,z4) is
  | x^2+y^2+z^2  x1^2+y1^2+z1^2  ...  x4^2+y4^2+z4^2 |

  |      z             z1        ...        z4       |
  |      1             1         ...        1        |
When this 5 by 5 determininant is expanded on its first column you get the
equation in the form
  A(x^2+y^2+z^2) + Bx + Cy + Dz + E = 0
If you need the center and radius, jyst divide through by A (it cannot be
zero if the 4 given points form a non-degenerate tetrahedron) and complete
the square on x, y, and z to obtain
  (x-xc)^2 + (y-yc)^2 + (z-zc)^2 = r^2

I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.


>And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any

Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

I think you are too optimistic! PostScript is a very big language and
so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of ANY arbitrary
ps code. The only program I know to manipulate PostScript files is
IslandDraw.
I for myself use xfig and include the PostScript files (converted to
epsi format). Small changes then are possible (erasing some letters,
adding text and so on).

Hi,

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan
My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
16.7 million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see 16.7
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged

Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful
options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared
to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --
again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful.

What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,
e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.

	Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident
8900c hi-color card? At best the colors come out screwed up, and at worst the 
program hangs. I loaded the VESA driver, and the same thing happens on 2 
different machines.

	If it doesn't work on the Trident, does anybody know of a viewer that 
does?

Thanx!

This algorithm works well for me:

Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:
---------------------------------------------------
First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices).

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge
dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently
orienting the entire surface.

Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point,
calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's
orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces
are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations
(mark them CLOCKWISE).

If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face
and go through the algorithm again.

At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found.

(Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the
IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to
this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're
not... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it
relies heavily on Inventor).

   I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that

   What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip

   bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
   pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
   the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
   with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
   manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at

   composite a series of frames would be even better.

   I've looked around and I haven't found a PC package that will perform
   this.  Help, please!

If you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation
into AutoDesk Animator .FLI or .FLC format, AutoDesk Animator will do
this for you.  It can take one animation, make a certain color
""clear"", and overlay it over another animation.  I do not have a way
right now to convert .AVI or .MPG files to animator files.  Animator
will also import a series of .GIF files to create an animation, so if
your video capture stuff can create this is might work.

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
  hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.

Therefore, it is (I think) desirable to try to create comp.graphics.

First, thanks to all who replied to my original question.

I've implemented the ideas from the article above and I'm very satisfied
with the results. I needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.
In some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. I now have a
fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. Although
I did not follow the article above strictly. The check if the fourth control
point lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas and
one ellips is too complicated. Instead I enlarged the loop-area and
surrounded it by for straight lines. The check is now simple and fast and
my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves
again!

In all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,
GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the
version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on
export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits
internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit
display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to
convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.
But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.
CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check
the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will
be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip
    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip
    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,
but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

Greetings this is a general call for information regarding Image
Processing. I am looking for any material related to the field, and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. In particular source code for general use packages.

I already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. I'm not
mathematically literate (ie. I don't have a degree in mathematics), so
any material that is suggested I would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

The best book I have found on the subject at the moment is:

""Practical Digital Image Processing""
by Rhys Lewis
ISBN: 0-13-683525-2
Published by Ellis Horwood (c)1990.

Likewise I am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
Image Processing techniques. So far I have 'xv', and 'khoros' for Unix.
'Dcview 2.1' for the IBM PC, and various related smatterings of C code
to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
via convolution etc.

If anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where I am
most likely to find it on the AARNET (Internet). If I can I would prefer
source code in C or Turbo Pascal that includes some Image Processing
code/algorithms, that I can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

All the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

First off: Thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
68070. I assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
further enhancements to the Motorola line, rather than meted out to
another company. Ah, well, I guess that's what I get when I assume the
computer industry will operate in a logical manner! ;-)

Version 1.5 of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of
the software. The older version is 1.0, and 1.6 is on the horizon in the
not too distant future.

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

He lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up.

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I
was using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,
the QT player Apple includes with the software.

>   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

No problem -- it still surprises me that Quicktime is able to do the
things it does as well as it can.

Hmm... 48 bit aye?
Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) 
may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.
Then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program
code.

	Take care,

Hi all,
I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC, Mac, Linux, and Amiga callers. 
Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard (a summary of 
which hit this group about 2 weeks ago). 
Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the BBS (I know I wouldn't)

Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC, Mac, Amiga. I know there
is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7
But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it.

Is there a color version of MGR for Linux? 
I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it.

Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?
I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing.

Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

Thanks in advan

Certainly. Reference follows. 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long
wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.
It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 
Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.

On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red
corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?

This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is
very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.

*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia:

1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) This is the new chromaticity. 

The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications 8(5) 28-40.

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.

>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow

Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and
the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or
obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)
C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
D) find the intersection as in step 3
E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A
F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.

Greetings,
    I have an Epson HI-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  It emulates an HP 7570
or 7574 - I'm not sure which.  It has an option board on it that does
the emulation.  It has a serial interface with Hardware handshake. I
also have 340 Pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 Black Oil based, 16
packs of 4 Red,Green, Blue, and Black pens, 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black,
7 packs of 4 Aqueous R,G,Blue,Black,  1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color
pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.

    The plotter is used.  I have tested it using the Windows drivers for
HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine.  It accepts either A or B
sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).

    I figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at
least another $200 more..  One thing is certain, you won't need to
purchase any pens for quite a while...  All of the packaged pens were
sealed so they are all still fresh.  The rest were capped and seem to
function as well.

    I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
just them.

    I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color.

    I'd like $350 or best offer...

	I just bought a copy.  I can't disagree that it is a very good
book.  But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature
described in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It
is easy to accomodate all the pixel ""descriptor"" (or color attributes)
in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what
I am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the
author didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If
anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics
manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please
send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome.

	Thanks in advance.

The 68070 is a variation of the 68010 that was done a few years ago by
the European partners of Motorola. It has some integrated I/O controllers
and half a MMU, but otherwise it's a 68010. Think of it the same as
the 8086 and 80186 were.

There was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
Transactions On Graphics. I believe Maureen Stone was one of
the authors. Sorry not to be more specific. I don't have the
reference here with me.

The article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide
whether a given (cubic) Bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points
or whatever wierdness. The same treatment is also available in SIGGRAPH 89
course notes for the course called ""Math for Siggraph"" or something like
that.

Peter,  there's a radiosity package ahead. The only problem is: there 
are a few miles to sail ... ;-^

Let's be serious... I'm working on a radiosity package, written in C++.
I would like to make it public domain.  I'll announce it in c.g. the minute
I finished it. 

That were the good news. The bad news: It'll take another 2 months (at least) 
to finish it. 

In the meantime you may have a look at the file
  Radiosity_code.tar.Z
located at
  compute1.cc.ncsu.edu

(there are some other locations; have a look at archie to get the nearest)

Hope that'll help.

Yours

  Actually the most flexible way to create temp files is to check for a TEMP or
TMP environment variable and create the files on the drive and directory pointedto by the variable.  This is pretty much a standard for DOS, Windows and OS/2

'Illumination and Color in Computer Generated Imagery' by Roy Hall contains c
source for several famous illumination models, including Bouknight, Phong,
Blinn, Whitted, and Hall illumination models. If you want an introduction to
shading you might look through the book 'Writing a Raytracer' edited by
Glassner. Also, the book 'Procedural elements for Computer Graphics' by Rogers
is a good reference. Source for code in these book are available on the net i

Yeah, of course... The term 'mach banding' was not the correct one, it should've
been 'color quantization effect'. Although a bad color quantization effect could
result in some visible mach-bands on a picture that was smooth before it was
quantizised.

	It depends on what kind of the polygons. 
	Convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s)

	Of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking

Where could I find a description of the JPG file format?  Specifically
I need to know where in a JPG file I can find the height and width of 
the image, and perhaps even the number of colors being used.

Any suggestions?

OK, never heard of Cross filters, but Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters
are standard spatial masks for edge detection.  Highpass filtering does a
good job of detecting edges, too.  A good reference for all sorts of general
digital image processing is the book _Digital Image Processing_ by
Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods.  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. 1992.
ISBN 0-201-50803-6

I've used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a
grad project.  Not too dificult to do.  The worst part is loading in the
images from TIFF/GIF/IFF-ILBM/whatever!  :)

I am working on a project where we are going to be including
both still and moving grapics within a database.  Of course
JPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the
various files.  However, from what I read on the Net, it seems
as if there are several different forms of each of these.

What I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can count
on as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is going
to support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so this
may be the format of choice.

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess
it is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any different
than standard MPEG files?

Thanx for any info!

I don't want texture mapped, cause if I did I'd asked for them. :)  Just
a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons.  As for the processor, it'd
be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if I can't find a good one for 286s.
Ideally, I want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport,
and write to an arbitrary location in memory.  Of course the chances of
finding something like that are pretty remote, so I guess I'd need the source
with it.  Oh, and I guess it would need to be in ASM otherwise it'd be too
slow.  I've seen some polygon routines in C, and they've all been waaay too
slow.  Its for a 3D vector graphics program.  I've been hunting high and low
for a polyn function in ASM, and I can't find one anywhere that I can use.
I've found one or two polyn functions, but my ASM is pretty bad, so I won't
even try to rewrite them. :)

Why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? Assuming an ARM
is about as efficient as a MIPS R3000 for integer calculations, doing
a Compact-Video-like digital video codec is an easy task. For Software
Motion Pictures (which is a lot like Compact Video, though it predates
it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a DECstation 5000/200. That
machine has a 25 Mhz MIPS R3000.

Recently we have found TIFF manipulation packages which do not recognize
TIFF files output by xv.  This is due to a missing XRESOLUTION and YRESOLUTION
tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for
valid TIFF.  I have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these
do indeed copy these tags.

Has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags?
I have been told that I could find some code in tiff/tools/tiffcp.c, but
that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv.  I
hope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it, but would prefer
to find code already known to work in xv.

Please help.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I
was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,
which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and
all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.

I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was
completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.

I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still
tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,
all to no avail.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the
""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have
this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""

I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the
brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today.

If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not
opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely
necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu
but if you'd rather post I'll be checking back here in a couple of days.

BTW, if the answer to this question is already in a FAQ somewhere, feel
free to flame away but I would ask that you also include the location and
name of the FAQ if you don't mind.

1. How VESA standard works?  Any documentation for VESA standard?

2. At a higher resolution than 320x200x256 or 640x480x16 VGA mode,
   where the video memory A0000-AFFFF is no longer sufficient to hold

   heard about memory mapping or video memory bank switching but know
   nothing on how it is implemented.   Any advice, anyone?  

3. My interest is in 640x480x256 mode.  Should this mode be called
   SVGA mode?  What is the technique for fast image scrolling for the
   above mode?  How to deal with different SVGA cards?


  Your guidance to books or any other sources to the above questions

Version 2 did it quite well, apart from a

with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like ""cannot export

 If anyone out there knows a way around this
I am all ears.
 Temporal images make a product called Filmpak

and I was just wondering if there was anything out

Exactly...

I didn't want to mess with tga or rle.  So I wrote the following script. 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities. 

This script is a .pov to .jpg converter.  Just run it like this:

  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]


  In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs. One is a C program that will perform a ""morph"" between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then
it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 
appreciated.

 I spoke with the author of MacWireFrame earlier today. The cost is $299, but there
 are no license royalties. His name is Eric Johnson in Sacramento, CA phone
 916/737-1550. He doesn't have email. Very nice guy... very knowledgeable about
 graphics. Seems like he may have a decent package. It's an Object Pascal Framework
 that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. 
 I'm going to check it out and see if it's got what I need for my CAD package.

 I also found another package: 3D Graphic Tools by Micro System Options in Seattle.
 The number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. The package is strong at ray tracing,
 I'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. I also need to look into this
 package some more. I also spoke with the author, Mark Owens, another nice
 guy that seems to know his business. The price is $249, no royalties.

                      Genoa Presents High Performance 
                        Video Graphics Accelerator

        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces 
WINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that 
delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the 
competition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  
The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local 
bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).
        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers 
maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 
of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 
non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater 
than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video 
standards.
        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, 
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility 
developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed 
offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards 
will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will 
transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is 
also offering this card in the ""TurboBahn"" combination packaged 
with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.
        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, 
WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 
value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to ""turbocharge"" 
the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D 
Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins 
are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.
        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 
IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two 
year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are 
currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, 
resellers, VARs and systems integrators.

	I was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a

something akin to that.  Anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  That's
60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  Specifically the 48-bit color?  That's 280
trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  Is this an anti-aliasing thing?  Or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.

	Also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are SGI's flagship products?  I know of

[ ..see previous article on this debate for the rests.. ]

I can see XV-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even I say
my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
obvious thing.
Please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
refered to text from which I wrote 'something' -- and you make
hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly I have written.

It is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
and don't understand include previously written material with the new
sentences to give them meaning. You seem to be one such.

You also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
wrong with XV 2.21 even I posted them within the article you did reply
to. Believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when I know
that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.

XV-3.00 and JPEG FAQ and users I have written to agree me with the
places you didn't; I'm sure you just didn't undertand what about I
wrote. We can blame my writing skills (in English?) for that, or?

Better stop the discussion and check what new ideas XV-3.00 gives;
I allready mailed one to Bradley...

    While I don't mean to damn Henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.

    Mach banding will occur for any image.  It is not the color
quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  It is the
human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
The result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
the brighter side and darker on the darker side.

The problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find
the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then
you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon.  There
are two ways to do this:  use a somewhat tricky but by-now well
examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,
or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
routine and accept O(n log n).  Both methods are discussed in
Preparata and Shamos, for example.

Can anybody suggest robust algorithms/code for computing the point of intersection
on n, 2-d lines in a plane. The data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
technique does not seem to provide satifactory results.

Please respond by e-mail and I will post the summary to the newsgroups
if there is sufficient interest.

Thanks,

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least
a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short
description of the process which we use; if you have further questions,
feel free to poke me via e-mail.

================================================================
*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion

0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This
   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are
   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.
   Consider deleting these edges.

1) Now, there are two goals:

    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)
    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)
       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured 
       using the digitized (x,y)'s).

2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For
   example:

    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you
       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will
       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the
       Reference(x,y). 
    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.
       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge
       the correct length (where ""correct"" is the DigitizedLength). 
       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the
       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the
       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.

3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).

alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider
how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist
on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to
balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length
of the edges.

WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be
observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and
you can't allow triangles to ""fold over"" neighboring triangles.  Both of
these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of
individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using 
the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the
original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was
prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and
change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I
*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more
compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having
every point interact with every other point....but first read up on
linear solutions to the n-body problem.

There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on
springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The
above method is described, in more or less detail in:

Yeah - they also gave it their ""Editor's Choice"" in the run-down of
graphics accelerators they tested in the previous issue, which is why
I bought (and then returned) mine.  The only conclusion I can come up with
is that PC Magazine has wildly different ways on determining the worthiness

  Visual Numerics Inc. (formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the
process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0 
and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent
Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through 
June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with 
ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge 
tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.
 
X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:
 
1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types
   available through a large collection of X resources.
2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers.
3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization.
4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback.
5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget 
   library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar 
   to X programmers.
6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.
   This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical
   layout of an application.
 
C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:
 
1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library
   is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C
   standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C.
2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse 
   interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control
   with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization.
3. Large collection of high-level application functions for ""two-call""
   graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available
   with minimal programming effort.
4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling
   the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot
   the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can 
   control the event loop.
 
If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please
contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call
713-279-1066.

Corel Draw will do it; version 2 onwards. If you have version 1 perhaps an
upgrade is in order.

Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript.

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with.

This sounds wonderful, but it seems no one either wants to spend time doing
this, or they don't have the power to do so.  For example, I would like
to see a comp.graphics architecture like this:

comp.graphics.algorithms.2d
comp.graphics.algorithms.3d
comp.graphics.algorithms.misc
comp.graphics.hardware
comp.graphics.misc
comp.graphics.software/apps

However, that is almost overkill.  Something more like this would probably
make EVERYONE a lot happier:

comp.graphics.programmer
comp.graphics.hardware
comp.graphics.apps
comp.graphics.misc

It would be nice to see specialized groups devote to 2d, 3d, morphing,
raytracing, image processing, interactive graphics, toolkits, languages,
object systems, etc. but these could be posted to a relevant group or
have a mailing list organized.

That way when someone reads news they don't have to see these subject
headings, which are rather disparate:

System specific stuff ( should be under comp.sys or comp.os.???.programmer ):

	""Need help programming GL""
	""ModeX programming information?""
	""Fast sprites on PC""

Hardware technical stuff:

	""Speed of Weitek P9000""
	""Drivers for SpeedStar 24X""

Applications oriented stuff:

	""VistaPro 3.0 help""
	""How good is 3dStudio?""
	""Best image processing program for Amiga""

Programming oriented stuff:

	""Fast polygon routine needed""
	""Good morphing alogirhtm wanted""
	""Best depth sort for triangles?""
	""Which C++ library to get?""

I wish someone with the power would get a CFD and then a CFV going on
this stuff....this newsgroup needs it.

Don't mind if I do.
As someone who would _love_ to see XV go to 24 bit, this
would be plenty for me.

    a) XV can Load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
24 bit glory on 24 bit X displays.
    b) All other operations (Crop, Dither, Smooth, etc.) are not
supported on 24 bit images.

how hard would this be?

Hello,

Error messages are,
% targatorle -o o.rle data.tga

xloadimage: X Error: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation) on 0x0

I know that I need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm, but I do not spend
time to install them. Even I do not want to generate .rgb from POVray
and then convert them to rle, if possible.(.rgb to rle works, but
it will mess up my directory with so many files, and it needs 2 more

Does any body out there have same experience/problems ?

Subject: Where did the hacker ethic go?
Lines: 46
Nntp-Posting-Host: acad3.alaska.edu
Organization: University of Alaska Fairbanks


  A great many computer programmers read ""Dr. Dobb's Journal"".  In a recent
issue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It
said:

  ""There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer
industry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90's.""

  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the ""cracker"" ethic, which is something
entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is
it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person
like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,
crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any
useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely
ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller
than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the
286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  

  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of
innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud
it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative
systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the
problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.

  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,
where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves ""hackers""
allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry?

  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips
the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon
the version.  I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11.  2.5 yielded the
50+ number.  I've also benchmarked this with Wintach at over 65 (from memory

As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this
quadrilateral fill command that requires just the four points.

It's very fast, but beware of buggy drivers, and otherwise no non-windows
support.

Graphics Gems (ISBN 0-12-286165-5).  The second step, intersecting the

Why not use the PD C library for reading/writing TIFF files? It took me a

At the moment i'm trying to grab a portion of a Starbase screen, and store it

shouldn't be a problem as the app is running on a 24 bit screen), though
i'm not too fussy about the exact format.

(I actually intend to write the data out as a TIFF but that bits not the

Does anyone out there know how to grab a portion of the screen? The

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

Maximum Strategy, Inc.
801 Buckeye Court
Milpitas, CA 95035-7408
sales@maxstrat.com

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

Interesting problem. Tell us more if you can?

I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and
better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
and (2) that DEC did.

On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market
position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in
computer lifetimes) relatively old.

On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, SGI's
history is better than DEC's.

(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they
going to ""abandon"" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade
path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)

as far as simply mapping your logo or whatever onto a cube or sphere, 
it's quite easy. Just either copy the GIF you want mapped into the map 
directory or add a map path to the directory where it currently is. Then 
go into the materials editor and make a new material with that as the bit

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.

1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)

2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere.

3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.

4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points.

I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
at a point. This might be easier to implement.

Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send
electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an  abstract and an outline to
msuk@ima.enst.fr
by May 30, 1993. The full paper must be submitted by July 31, 1993 to:

Hi Steve,

As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your
mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
software - the quick answer is yes! The long answer is yes - but a
few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are
the same, you know! As far as ""many bugs"" go, it would probably be more
useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)

Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix
Sun Solaris so it is possible.

The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the
RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
how to fix it.

As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would
bother releasing it, if that was the case? Perhaps you didn't read the
few docs that ARE supplied. The dogfight world is made up of clients
only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see
anything! The dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't
see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!

One final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.
If you are interested, then please remember that I'm not asking for
any money! So why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,
maybe that will get results??

Robert.

Corel Draw 4 will be able to do this as it will include the Photopaint stuff that 
the PC version got with version 3. Don't hold your breath though.

  I've talked with Mark and he faxed some literature, though it wasn't very helpful-
  just a list of routine names: _BSplineSurface, _DrawString3D... 241 names.
  There was a Product Info sheet that explained some of the package capabilities.
  I also found a review in April/May '92 MacTutor.

  It does look like a good package. The current price is $295 US.

 Are you using the traditional radiosity method, progressive refinement, or
  something else in your package?

 If you need to project patches on the hemi-cube surfaces, what technique are
  you using?  Do you have hardware to facilitate the projection?

amen.. I too have learned by example, specifically yours. :)

>What can I say but keep the faith, there are others who do likewise.

.. but dorsai leads the way.. Unlike other services that are commercial
in nature, dorsai is a community based service. While others charge
monthly fees for access, dorsai accepts donations from those who can
afford to contribute.

   While other systems don't respond to user input, dorsai thrives on it.
Other systems sell hardware for a profit, dorsai donates hardware to
community service groups, and to individuals who couldn't afford to
normally.

   Dorsai lives due to the ""hacker"" ethic of Charles, Jack, Skip, Cara,
Ira, Mark, David etc etc etc..  sleepless nights and days working on
equipment thats been assembled at the embassy, ( and modifying what
ever else available to work the first time..) in order to keep the
slip line up...

   Heres to you bud... I'm one of the few that decided to
stay, and am damn glad that I did..... :)

No, VGALIB?  Amazing..  I guess it was lost in all those subdirs :-)
Thanks for correcting me.  It doesn't sound very appealing though, only
320x200?  I'm glad it wasn't something major I missed.

Usually, you apply

[R]    [ 1     0        1.402   ][Y]
[G] =  [ 1  -0.34414   -0.71414 ][U]
[B]    [ 1    1.772     0       ][V]


after unlevelshifting U and V (subtracting 128 from them).

This matrix multiplication may give results out of RGB space, so you
have to clamp the resulting bytes to [0..255].
The conversion should be done with arbitrary big integers, not floats :)

This applies to YUV data whereas NTSC may have YIQ where a 33 degree
rotation to U/V is buid in.

I am looking for comments from people who have used/heard about PhotoShop
for Windows. Is it good? How does it compare to the Mac version? Is there
a lot of bugs (I heard the Windows version needs ""fine-tuning)?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated..

Thank you.

Up until last week, I have been running POVray v1.0 on my 486/33 under DOS5
without any major problems.  Over Easter I increased the memory from 4Meg to
8Meg, and found that POVray reboots the system every time under DOS5.  I had
a go at running POVray in a DOS window when running Win3.1 on the same system
and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  I would like to go back to 
using POVray directly under DOS, anyone any ideas???

Nntp-Posting-Host: dali.math.chalmers.se

Lines: 15

I have some color gifs which I would like to archive in a much smaller
size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. The quantization to 16 grays
introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated
by dithering. Up to now I have used XV to process the images, but now I
would like to automate the procedure.

The problem is that XV can't (I think) convert images automatically, and the
obvious alternative PNMPLUS (PPMQUANT and PNMDITHER) don't even get close to
XV's quality. PNMDITHER apparently dithers in RGB, even though the images
are in grayscale. The dithering routine in XV seems to use the natural image
colors for the dither. Is this or any similar routine available in the
public domain? If so, where?

chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was
a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and
age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our
minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost
from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over
its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.

Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support

to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there
will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,
but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you

Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,
but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*
you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)

won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we

Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about)
will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng
ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at
640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I
think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it
use the ET4k modes.

VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
mode. Haven't tried it though...

(Btw, my version of VGAlib is 1.2.)

There is a vast literature on Delaunay triangulations, literally
hundreds of papers.  A program is even provided with every copy of 
Mathematica nowadays.  You might look at this if you are interested in 
using it for creating 3D objects:

(1) No explicit (c) is necessary.  If it the image is attributed to the
Geosphere Company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been
given to reprint.

(2) Unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals.
However, ""interesting"" images do make their way into ads and
computer demos. That is when a pirate might get some flak.
This image is considered so ""interesting"" that many people would
like to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there
is lots of temptation.

(3) One mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery-
is not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be.  Not true.
A new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected.
This image is certainly fits such, since NO ONE ELSE has taken the
tremendous effort to re-create it themselves.  Precedent is a recent
telephone book court case.  Ma Bell tried to copyright the data in
their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are
trick entries in the book).  But the court only permitted copyright
of the expression of the data, and not the data themselves. (You cant
xerox and sell the telephone book.)

(4) There will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future
and computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as Bill Gates
are currently hoarding the digital copyrights.

(5) I'd prefer that Geosphere put this data in the public domain because
it is very interesting to me and others, but that's the way things are.

I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics.  

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  I'm not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  
I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something,
what do you think?

Don't get too excited; Signetics, not Motorola, gave the 68070 its number.
The 68070, if I understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has
an on-chip serial port and DMA.  (It will run at up to 15 MHz--I'm typing
at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so I know that it can
do so--so I seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com

They are 3D object files for CAD 3D 2.0, a program written by Tom Hudson
for the Atari ST computers.  Don't know much more about them except that
they are stored with the points first, then the surfaces are next, and are
made by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface. Then
there's a header that describes coloring, lighting, etc.  Don't know much
more than this, hope this helps.

For Visuallib, will it run with Metaware High C compiler v3.0?  Any

Why so up tight?  FOr that matter, TIFF6 is out now, so why not gripe
about its problems?  Also, if its so important to you, volunteer to
help define or critique the spec.

Finally, a little numerology:  42 is 24 backwards, and TIFF is a 24 bit
image format...

Maybee you should persuade your burea that for only $650 they can become much
more competitive, taking input from Autocad, PostScript andGif as well as
SCODL... 

Seriously, this sounds like something the bureau should have. Or find another
bureau. You should not be the one buting this software.

Hello,
I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously 
Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is ""VGA 4000 TrueColor"".
It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and
at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc.
Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely
the Windows 3.1 driver.
Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode.
Some articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts
made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.

Does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? How can I write
a driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution
of 640 x 480 with 45 Hz interlaced ?

Greetings,

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.

In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

(I don't claim to be a superhacker, but I don't think that invalidates my remarks.
And I'm sure this isn't the whole story.)

Hi everyone,

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups:

*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******

Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.

Features:

   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.
   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
   Generic clients.
   Customizable servers.
   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
        attached.

Functionality:

  Client:
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users.

   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:

    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates)

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)

  Server(s):
   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers:

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want.

    o Event Handler Registration:
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)

    o Collision Detection Registration:
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software.
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose.

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:

    o Provide an initWorld function:
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
        any initialization you want to do.

    o Provide a positionObject function:
        This is where you determine where to place a new client.

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:
        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o Provide a getWorldType function:
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.

    o Provide an animateWorld function:
        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects
        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrunning the clients).

    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided:

        generic - 81 lines
        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future
                           versions)
        dogfight - 72 lines

Location:

   This software is located at the following site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   Directory:
   pub/virtual-worlds

   File:
   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z

Futures:

   Client:

    o Texture mapping.

    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading

    o HMD support.

    o Etc, etc....

   Server:

    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).

    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction

    o Etc, etc....

   Both:

    o Improved Comms!!!

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I
would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Finally one major disclaimer:

This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Disclaimer over!

Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with
POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who
hates it: > /dev/null!

************************************************************************

And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it
creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary.
If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially
printing.

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film
system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.

If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:

For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to
produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
video to the Net.

We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for
commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.

The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll
digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as
an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker
of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been
unable to deliver.  Our system produces ""near VHS"" quality at 30 fields per
second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60
fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some
find distracting.

If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing 
software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of
different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.

Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever
used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology
and the user interface.

The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21"" Apple mon-
itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),
Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.

For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality
that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more
effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system
will look better.

We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!

We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place
in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working
on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 
and ones that will give prettier images.

Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 
going to present a paper titled ""Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains""
which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 
conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape 
with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 
presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.

We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 
and terrain elevation maps (DTM). 
Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can
be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can
be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can
also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.

If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such
data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us
directly :

amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or
danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)

Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be
cited in our paper, and in further publications.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (LZW?).

IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package
images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved
BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory /pub/graphics.formats
(Taken from the FAQ for this news group.)  :)

Hi,

I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes
positioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save
to a .PRJ file their positions/orientation are preserved.  Does anyone
know why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is
explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file. 
I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have 
the format for the .PRJ file?

Is the .CEL file format available from somewhere?

        Yep... Alchemy works fine on my Tseng400+DAC, but I think I remember
reading that it only displays in 15-bit or so.  Of course, that's still 32K
colors which is nothing to sneeze at.  Use the --v flag.

Dear Prospective Employer:

I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware, 
C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and
computer networking.

I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics
Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 
from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer
Engineering at Iowa State University.

During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have
published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.
These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly.

I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level. 
I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS.
I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant,
am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform 
GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating
system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in
computer networking.

While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I
have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.

My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics
Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 
I am eager to hear from you soon.

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline
very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the
wrong way"".

	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its auto-trace tool.

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future
analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,
clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real
life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case.

	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no
bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods.

Organization: International Foundation for Internal Freedom

I'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video
mathematically.  What is the transform?  Is it a simple
reversal of the hue value in the HSV color space?  Is it
a manipulation in the YUV color space?  How is it related
to solarization?

If you want to see something truly wild, turn on the
reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped,
and point it at the monitor.  This creates a chaotic
dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along
rotation, zoom, focus, etc.  Very very surprising and 
lovely.  I'd like to write a simulation of this effect
without analog grunge.  Thanks for any info you may have.

Please e-mail any info to me.  I'll post a summary.

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface ""flips"" when
you travel across that edge.  This is bad.  

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.  

    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as ""OK""
    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which
       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as ""OK"",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.

If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose. 
    
Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise...

I have a small program to extract a 640x480 image from a vga 16 color screen,

sales brochure, which I then need printed in 4 color.  On a mac, I would
use Photoshop to separate the image into 5 EPS files, and then pull it into
quark express, then get it printed to film on a lintronix at a service bureau.

However, I don't have a mac, but I do have windows.  What would I need to

For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article
in The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling
intro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment.
The book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application
to image compression is clear from the text.

    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of
rendering include:

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using:
            - Painter's algorithm.
            - BSP trees.

There is a new product for the (IBM'ers) out there... it is called

3rd version....(1st) for the IBM.... it can do morphing, your standard key-framming animation, it is a raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects... (like ripple, explode, bounce) things of that nature.  Also it has algorithmic texture maps....and your standard brushmapping also...

you can have animated brushmaps...(ie. live video mapped on the objs)...
also animated backdrops (ie. live video backgrounds)
also animted reflections maps....

you get the idea.... it will run for about 500$ retail (I think)...

dont let the low price fool you.... this product can do it all when it
comes to 3D-animation and Renderering...!

also....does anyone here know how to get in the Imagine mailing list??
please e-mail me if you do or post up here....

need to be identified with the entity's name.  The number of entities < 1000

Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it
in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point
me in the right place to look...

We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole
passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:

                                                          |
                                     ||                   [ image
                                                          |
  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen
                            metallic || tube              |
                                     ||                   |
                                                          |

We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However,
the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the
object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not
parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely
that the object is placed so conveniently.  

Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot
know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that
they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?

Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar
(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the
screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?

So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the
image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how
do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.

Thanks in advance, Simon.

be held at the university campus at the world's northernmost
university. There will be conference buses going to the campus
from within walking distances of all the hotels. More detailed
information about the locations and transport will be available
at the conference hotels.

Travel Information
Tromsoe Airport at Langnes is only 7-8 minutes drive from the
centre of Tromsoe. The travelling distance from Oslo is 1 hr
40 minutes. SAS Conference Support Tromsoe offers airticket
services for the conference. In addition to all standard terms
full and reduced fare tickets from Europe and overseas,
(reduced fares require that you stay in Scandinavia the night
between Saturday and Sunday), we can offer additional conference
fares for SAS flights from SAS destinations within Scandinavia,
and reduced fares on Norwegian domestic flights. If you want to
make use of this service please contact Bodil Lauritsen at the
Conference Secretariat.

Note that reduced airticket fares can not be obtained on flights to 
Scandinavia if you don't stay the night between Saturday and Sunday 
(in front of or after the conference). On the other hand you don't have
to stay that night in Tromso to obtain reduced fares within Scandinavia
(SAS flights).

Actuallay I don't, but on the other hand I don't support the idea of having
one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by Brian,
in his reply to my original posting.
I would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,
comp.graphics.hw_and_sw
The reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.
I takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
three I'm interested in.

I understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
meeting. I agree to some extension. I see news as a forum to exchange ideas,
help others or to be helped. I think this is difficult to achive if there
are so many different things in one meeting.

Good evening netters|-)

Sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but I'm not

The problem is, that the files I want to read are in compressed form

plain (uncompressed) format. I don't know where to get the original
TIFF specification, furthermore I haven't any access to a realy complete

Computer Graphics Resource Listing : WEEKLY POSTING [ PART 2/3 ]
===================================================
Last Change : 27 April 1993


14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)

  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner
  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).
  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.

Robot
-----
  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written
  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).
  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at
  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.

VG plotting library
-------------------
  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov
  [129.6.64.151]

Xgobi
-----
  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are
  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it
  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena
  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge
  from STATLIB at CMU.
  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and
  in the body area of the message, put the line

  send xgobi from general

  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu. Log in as
  ""statlib"" and use your e-mail address as your password. Then type

  cd general
  mget xgobi.*

  Warning: It's about 2 MB sources + large Postscript manual. Read the
  relevant README to decide whether you need it or not.

PGPLOT
------
  Runs on VAX/VMS and supposedly on UNIX. It's a set of fortran routines freely
  available (though copyrighted and requiring a nominal fee of $50 or so)
  that includes contour plots and support for various devices, including ps.

Athena Plotter Widget set
-------------------------
  
  This version V6.0 is based on Gregory Bond's version V5-beta. Added
  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,
  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.
  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the
  plotting area for zooming-in. Version V6.0 has a log of bugs fixed and a
  log of improvements against V6-beta. Additionally I did some other
  changes/extensions, besides 
  
  -     Origin and frame lines for axes.
  -     Subgrid lines on subtic positions.
  -     Line plots in different line types (lines, points, lines+points,
   impulses, lines+impulses, steps, bars), line styles (solid, dotted,
   dashed, dot-dashed) and marker types for data points.
  -     Legend at the right or left hand side of the plot.
  -     Optional drawing to a pixmap instead of a window.
  -     Layout callback for aligning axis positions when using
   multiple plotters in one application.

PLPLOT
------
  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,
  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,
  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or
  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually
  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are
  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four
  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
  including a portable metafile format and renderer.
  
  Freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous FTP on
  hagar.ph.utexas.edu, directory pub/plplot
  
  At present (v. 4.13), PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few.

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

Subject: outlining of spline surface
Keywords: spline rasterization
Lines: 38


	About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
solutions to it.

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw 
the object we 

1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure.
2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
3) Depth sort the triangles
4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw
	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special ""edge color""

	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area.

Try ImageMagick. I cannot test it but one told me it does 24bit.

Off the top of my head, I might try:

Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4

Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4), 
       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the 
x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  
Solve using your favorite method.  :)


All the best,

- John :)

PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the
PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API's for the PEX protocol,
which is an extension to the X protocol.

So it depends on You, what you go to use.

Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs, 
SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects.

Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics, because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs
to a Prortocol.

   I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,
   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.
   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)

NAME
   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both
  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The
  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of
  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image.

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 
  the processed image will be displayed.

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing
    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with
    the option of subpixel sampling.

  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text
    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.

  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished
    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-
    lability of graphical histograms of the image.

  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-
    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,
    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions
    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle).

  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-
    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.

  o Performs histogram equalization.

  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
    arbitrary order.

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.

  o Cuts and pastes across images.

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images. (SlideShow)

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

  o Performs image type conversions.

  o Converts image formats.

  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it.

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra.

  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEG(JFIF) format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.
      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScript(Write only)

Hardware requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.

Where to get it:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z
   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73

   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking

Acknowledgement:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.
   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.
   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.

---------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of
  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical
  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it
  (and you will like it).
  
  As always, any comments/bug reports are welcome.

    I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a
great card especially with my multimedia presentations.  It runs graphics
and animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  The only
thing I can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  Its qualit in
between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly
compromise speed.  It seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes
with some great software, but Im not so sure about the excelerator
part.  I used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster
than that.  One thing I do like is that it loads its own vesa driver
from ROM at startup, (I think) because I have never had to load it for
links386 or any other programs that require special VESA drivers at
startup.

Nope, this won't work for a cylinder. You can have a line arbitrarily close
to the the cylinder backbone, and yet not intersect it. The test works for a
pillbox, though. (a cylinder with two hemispheres attached at the ends.)

I'm planning to buy a new VLB/EISA system with a good graphic performance.
So far I looked at the ATI GUP VLB as my favorite graphics-card. But 
recently I heard something about a new card from  Miro. It was the Miro
Crystal 24s with 3 MB and True Color support up to 1024x768. It costs just a
little more than the ATI. So, can't decide which one matches better my needs.
Any technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the
Miro card) would be greatly appreciated.

     ROME REBORN: THE VATICAN LIBRARY & RENAISSANCE CULTURE

                        an Exhibit at the
                       Library of Congress
                      Washington, DC  20540

                 Available by anonymous FTP from
                          seq1.loc.gov
                         (140.147.3.12)

                      /pub/vatican.exhibit



ROME REBORN:  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some 200 of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome.  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through
April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely.

     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican
Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &
Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came
to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each
section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,
but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and
to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If
you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local
computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please
contact me.

    Login in anonyomus or ftp  with a valid email address as the password

Wouldn't this require a hyper-sphere.  In 3-space, 4 points over specifies
a sphere as far as I can see.  Unless that is you can prove that a point
exists in 3-space that is equi-distant from the 4 points, and this may not
necessarily happen.

Correct me if I'm wrong (which I quite possibly am!)
