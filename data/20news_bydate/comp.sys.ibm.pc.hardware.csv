VESA local bus with 1-2MB RAM.  Does anyone have suggestions/ideas on:

  - Diamond Stealth Pro Local Bus

  - Orchid Farenheit 1280

  - ATI Graphics Ultra Pro

  - Any other high-performance VLB card


Please post or email.  Thank you!

Think!

It's the SCSI card doing the DMA transfers NOT the disks...

The SCSI card can do DMA transfers containing data from any of the SCSI devices
it is attached when it wants to.

An important feature of SCSI is the ability to detach a device. This frees the
SCSI bus for other devices. This is typically used in a multi-tasking OS to
start transfers on several devices. While each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. When the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

On an IDE bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. This is typically a 10-20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.

Subject: Need help identifying Serial board
Organization: Strategic Software, Redford, Michigan
Lines: 26

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
	     
The only identification printed on the board is ""MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD""
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words ""SERIAL NO"", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers ""1990 2 8"".

Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

[discussing the use of IRQ 7]

In  recent article msprague@superior.mcwbst311b (Mike Sprague) writes:

>I as a number of poeple in this thread have already written
>(I can't prove it's true, but I believe it), LPT1 does not

To put it a little differently:

 - IRQ 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
   printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

 - DOS doesn't monitor IRQ 7; it uses other means to determine when it's
   time to send out another byte to the printer.

 - Most (all?) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
   the use of IRQ 7, usually by merely breaking the connection between
   the ISA pin and the associated driver.  Other adapters control the
   IRQ line by a tri-state driver, and by programming just leave it
   in the high-impedence mode.

 - Unfortunately, there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
   drivers (i.e., either assert high or assert low) for the IRQ lines
   rather than tristate drivers (assert high, assert low, or don't
   assert anything).  The presence of such a card on an IRQ line precludes
   the use of that IRQ by any other adapter unless it is physically 
   disconnected by a jumper.

   (Incidentally, note that there's no requirement that a card hold
   the IRQ line low when no interrupt is desired.  If that were true
   you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected IRQ lines, and
   that certainly isn't a requirement.)

 - Non-DOS operating systems (OS/2, NT (?), various Unices or whatever the
   proper plural of Unix might be) require the use of IRQ 7 for performance
   reasons.  

And the SB16, alas, is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

Subject: CACHE or Micronics EISA/VLB Motherboard?
Organization: Indiana University Computer Science, Bloomington
Lines: 27


This might be a silly question but I have to ask it anyway. I am in
the process of purchasing an EISA/VL Bus 486 DX2-66 computer and I
found two places that sell machines that have what I want and have the
same price. The first is Ares and they use a Cache motherboard (that's
the brand of the motherboard) with OPTI chip set, the other is Micron
(formerly Edge Technology) and they use the Micronics EISA/VLB
motherboard.

I said that this might be a silly question since I believe that
Micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while I never
heard of Cache! I am however leaning towards the Ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good, solid machines
and they have good tech support (24 hr, 7 days/wk), and a better
warrantee (2 years).  Micron, on the other hand, seems to have
recently aquired Edge Technologies and I'm not sure how much I should
trust the company.

I would REALLY appreciate any input on this. Is the Micron machine the
clear choice?  Does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company? Has anyone ever heard of Cache motherboards? Should I
go with Micron just because it has the Micronics motherboard? etc.

Thanks very much in advance for any information.

BusLogic just announced the BT445 FAST SCSI-2 VLB Interface as of
April 20.  This always happens to me!

I have a one week old BT545S which is the ISA version.  I am
enjoying spectacular performance with a Micropolis MC2105 560mb 10ms
3.5"" HH 5200 RPM drive.  I'll be changing to the BT445 VERY soon,
though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
the 32bit VESA support.

You can call BusLogic and ask 'em about the NT question. I hear that
the support is excellent.   I have not had to call them myself yet.

IDE also uses DMA techniques.  I believe floppy controller also uses DMA,
and most A/D boards also use DMA.  DMA is no big deal, and has nothing to
do directly with SCSI.

You can thank your software for that.  If DOS had a few more brains, it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  The
hardware will support it, but DOS (at least) won't.  Again, this has   
nothing to do with SCSI.

And if you stick with DOS you'll wonder why you can't multitask.

Again I ask why can't a UNIX or OS/2 type OS do all the miraculous things
with an IDE harddrive that it can with a (single) SCSI hard drive.

Experiences with Diamond Viper VLB video card

Several problems:

1) The ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1MB
   of VRAM, which is what I have. This color depth is NOT SUPPORTED
   with video BIOS version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. A max of 65K
   colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1MB
   VRAM.

2) With the 65K color choice I notice two minor irritations:

   a) Under NDW, when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
      Open menu) and then is deselected, a faint vertical line often
      remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
      be.

   b) With Word for Windows, when you use shading in a table, the
      display shows the INVERSE of the shading; for example, if you
      shade the cell as 10%, the display is 90% (the printout is OK).

3) The big killer bug is using the Borland C++ Integrated Development
   Environment. The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger
   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the
   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed
   to do). The screen goes haywire, and is largely unreadable. The
   Turbo Debugger display is all garbled.

   Through trial and error, I have found that when the disrupted screen
   is displayed you should do [Alt-Spacebar] followed by the letter
   ""R"". This instructs Turbo Debugger to refresh the screen, and it
   does this satisfactorily. I wish I didn't have to do this.

   The bug is more than with the Diamond drivers. The same disruptive
   behavior happens with the standard VGA driver that comes with
   Windows. There must be something in the video card that mishandles
   the VGA mode.
   
   The problem is not my monitor. The same bug shows up when I use
   another monitor in place of my usual one.

I still like this video card, and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other ""board"" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day
delivery.  The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
power supply.  PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO.

Well SCSI is ALSO a FLOPPY drive interface.  In the Mac {since SCSI is THE
inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive {called CPU in all identifiers.}  This allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the OS, program, CPU, SCSI, and drive can handle 
it{this shows up best in the Quatra line}.
In the IBM that uses SCSI for the FLOPPY drive this should happen as well.
Also SCSI is NOT just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards 
{this showed up for the Plus as the NuBus 'Cage'}, CD-ROM, etc.
IDE seems to be mainly hard drives.  As for specs nobody has GIVEN me any
and I can't find any.  Besides the advertizments call IDE the AT interface
{Make of that what you will}
SCSI is a jack of all trades and IDE is a master of ONE.
This alone puts SCSI above IDE.  SCSI-2 blows IDE out of the water.
Remember SCSI was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
{When the Mac prices came down to Earth} so the Rule of Scale still played
and SCSI remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the High end
computer world at times and THIS more than anything else proably kept SCSI
off into the statosphere price wise}
SCSI came FROM the high end computer world with multitasking OS were the
standard for the most part.  Of all the interface NeXT could have used it
choose SCSI.  In 16-bit and 32-bit mode SCSI is a multi-tasking OS desined
interface while IDE and 8-bit SCSI are braindead run one program interfaces
{at least the way mac use 8-bit SCSI.UGH}

No. All that I've seen have also an on-board BIOS which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under DOS (2 drives is a DOS
limitation and you have the same problem with IDE and all other
standards for that matter). Software drivers often allow for better
performance, though. You have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

>Will this also be true of the 32-bit OS's?

Obviously these are not able to use the 16-bit real mode BIOSes that
are written for DOS, so you need software drivers. That's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available), because you won't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.

For the past week or so I've been trying to install a QIC-36 tape drive

set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
retension, write and erase, I also booted the system clean and still the

suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that I need to slow it down.
My system has an AMI BIOS and I don't have the advanced chip setting

Summary: How to make IDE and ESDI controllers live together???
Keywords: HD, controller, IDE, ESDI, disks
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 57

Hello all,

You, the Net, are my last resort, or I'll just change my job :-)
This might be a FAQ (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.

Sys: 486/33, AMI BIOS, and your run-of-the mill multi-I/O card with
serials/paral/floppies and 
	- IDE controller ""clone"" Gw2760-EX
		there are no jumpers affecting the HD or ctrller :-( 
	- Quantum ProDrive LPS (3"" 105M type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).

Pb: I want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
	- Maxtor XT-B380E (~330M, <15ms, BIOS type 1, ctrller manages
		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
	- Western Digital WD1007V-SE1 ESDI ctrller: no floppies.
		(jumpers set IRQ 14/15, hw port addr 1F0/170,
		and BIOS addr CC00/C800, and other floppy/format stuff)

Goal: have the WD ESDI as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
simultaneously working. Being able to boot from the ESDI too would be 
a nice bonus but is not expected.

Ultimate goal: have room for Linux et al.
Ex of scheme I have in mind: boot from IDE (HD or floppy) and mount
the ESDI as root. Not booting from ESDI, or even from HD, is acceptable.

I have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. They work alone,
or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the ESDI or the IDE, 
depending on setup/jumpers.

Useful suggestions might be:
- How do I tell the BIOS setup about two ctrllers (I guess the 2nd HD
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
- Do I need some driver to make it work?
- --- "" --- some new BIOS/chip for any of these cards?
- do I have to buy another controller to make them HDs happy? IDE
is cheaper; ESDI is hard to find and rather costly. I'm not 
rich or I wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
- adapters of some sort; I can hold a soldering iron, and can change
a chip or put a jumper!

Also useful:
- BBS or Hot-line of Western Digital.
- ftp archives with relevant info.
- expert stores in Toronto, Ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
- any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
- anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )

Direct or posted replies are ok.
	Many thanks,
			Cat.

I think it's simply because DOS doesn't use the IRQ for anything. OS/2 does,
so with that you can't share the IRQ.

Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just
bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.

How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is
the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to
have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from
time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???

Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed? Save up for a
*really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save
my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...

It's not true.  IDE bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of ISA bus but its (IDE bus) signal timing
doesn't have to be same to ISA signal timing.  My VL-IDE bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3MB/sec up to 8.3MB/
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
*milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   You
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3MB/sec on the ISA bus.

Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with the

The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,
has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in 
a flatter screen than other 17"" monitors using the standard trinitron 
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and 
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

I dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
SCSI/IDE cards that is available.  You will have to turn your IDE off.

Instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  With some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  With others it may be a type 47.  I had one
controller that I had to tell the BIOS that no hard disk was installed.

Do not low level format a SCSI unless you have the SCSI low level format program. 
First use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.

AAAHHHH!!!!!  Please someone tell me what I have done!!!

My 40 Meg miniscribe (8450AT) has a big sticker on the side that says

***DO NOT ROTATE INTERRUPTER** --->  (big knob here)

A big knob sticking off the side of the drive is pretty hard NOT to turn
when removing the drive!

I turned it.   Now the drive won't spin up!  Even with no data or controller
cables plugged in.. just power... it won't spin up!!

Please help!

The Adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  This means that the CPU
doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other
computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking OS, that is.  DOS
just sits and waits anyway.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first? :-) IDE
was designed to plug into ISA virtually unaided - in essence, IDE *is*
ISA, on a ribbon cable.  Therefore it's specs are the same as ISA -
8MHz clock, 16 bit width, 5MB/sec.

This is why I've concluded that IDE on VL-bus is a waste of a fast
slot.  The card's job would to slow the VL-bus transactions to ISA
speed.  Heck, that's what ISA slots do - I'll just use one of those
instead.

This is easily done by getting a large toroid core from your local

[REMAINDER DELETED]

I don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but I can offer the
following in the interim:

   1)  The card uses port addresses 0x2E0 and 0x2E8 (which are NOT
       configurable).  These addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
       omitted from my version of the manual.

   2)  I believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
       IRQ 2 (for CGA or EGA support??!?).

(How is 0-40 twice 1.25? Do you just pick whatever SCSI setup that makes

Even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that ESDI and IDE (I include SCSI and ATA) are
completely different (ESDI is device-level, like MFM/RLL).

Great, you can compare two numbers (ATA has several speed modes, by the

I would recommend people call the NCR board and download the ANSI specs

Something is missing there. :) Anyway, I agree. There's a lot of

The 50 MHz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. Most
of the DX-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
DX2-50:s. Also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
better off at 33 MHz bus speed. The 8k internal cache allows the
DX2-66 to be generally faster anyway.

Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

I think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  Your HD stopped boot probably because your HD controller can't handle the faster BUS speed.  I have a 486-33DX, I set my bus divider to CLK/2.5, that is close to 13MHz.  I can gain singificant performace increase on my Video card and harddisk transfer rate when I boost the bus speed.  And my system work flawlessly under this setting.  And you know what, when I go to CLK/2(17MHz BUS), my HD refuse to boot.  

Just my 2 cent.

I have both!

IDE on the DROS box 'cos it only has a hard disk, SCSI on my Unix box 'cos it

I bought SCSI as it makes adding many devices easier. For the price of one
irq and dma I have three different types of device connected up.

Faster drives are also available for SCSI - I have a DEC DSP3085s that realy

Many state of the art SCSI disks use the *SAME* mechanicals as many state of the

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does 
not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

A properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller! My Unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5MB/s! That's
faster than the standards ISA bus can ever sustain!

Hi,
	would someone please email (and post)
the AVI (Microsoft) file format.  I wish to
do some research using this format, as there
are disks available with video clips.  It is
interesting because it interleaves sound and
video.

Thank you

send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer READY light would
go off and stop working.  I disabled emm386.exe and the problem went away.
I would like to continue using emm386.exe if possible.  I would greatly

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

Seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their
relative merits, wouldn't it be fine, if for internal highspeed modems there
were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the  
modem, thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies ?
Just an idea,

We had the same issue plague us for months on our Gateway.  I finally
got tired of it so I permanently interchanged the drives.  The only
reason I didn't do it in the first place was because I had several
bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected
the A drive.  I order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and
the number of ""stupid"" install programs that can't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time - the ones I had are now upgraded.  And
as for the bootable 5-1/4's I just cut 3-1/2 replacements.

If switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis.  I haven't tried it but I think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.

Still no good.  WatchIT TV will not work on a with local bus video.
It will not work in any high reolution modes either.  The people who
make the card assure me that they will have a card available in June 
that supports both local-bus and hi-res.  BTW does anyone know the
name of the company who makes watchit tv?  Phone #?  BBS? Internet?

While rummaging through a box of old PC (5150) parts, I found a half-size
board that looks like a comm port board.  It was made by Forte Data Systems and
has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  The board provides a male 24-pin connector
and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled A B C.  I plugged it into my PC
and ran Advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each
time, but the system did not recognise a comm port.

Does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?
I could use another comm port if it's free.

That figure (1/4"") for image rotation would seem to be a little high...

I can't speak for MAG Innovision but as far as NEC is concerned, they are
adjusted to ""factory-spec"" before leaving the central USA distribution point
(MA) for the eastern Canadian market. Now, here's the key: NEC *knows* that
the >=15"" monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps, rough handling, and such) and therefore
*expect* and (at least in theory) *require* that the local *distributor*
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the *local* service centre (Bull HN
Information Systems in Toronto) before sale. This is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a ""perfect"" monitor
(the definition of ""perfect"" seems to depend on how picky one is, in my
case quite :).

>Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

I, for one, was not willing to accept what I considered a substandard
monitor and, after two months of wrangling and direct contact with NEC,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect, IMHO,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was ""normal""). The short answer is no, don't accept these
""imperfections"" as ""normal"" because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors, one has a right to expect higher quality, and
if you're persistent, you'll receive it.

	Hi everyone,
	I have a question regarding my stack on my pc.  I am programming 
in Turbo C 3.0 and my program is rather large (model large too).  I keep 
getting errors that I am running out of memory after a while of running the 
program. When I compile the program, it says I have 4.45 meg of RAM so 
I can't seem to explain why it crashes.

All it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting, it will screw up all the variables. This leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.  

Does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions
that do not return anything??

	I have been working on this problem for days and I would really
appreciate any responce.  If this is not the correct newsgroup, I will
gladly re-post, but this is the only I could find.

I think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my

* Please check the Vote Acknowlegement (ACK) at the end of this CFV.
* If your name/address is not there, please send your vote again.

Introduction:

	This is the third (and final) Call For Votes (CFV) for the creation
	of four OS/2 newsgroups and the renaming of one:
	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting     (unmoderated)
	(b)  renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
	     comp.os.os2.programmer.misc               (unmoderated)
	(c)  comp.os.os2.setup                         (unmoderated)
	(d)  comp.os.os2.multimedia                    (unmoderated)
	(e)  comp.os.os2.bugs                          (unmoderated)

	This is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
	and comp.os.os2.setup, and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
	comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.  The first attempt failed in the summer
	of 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules
	state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
	after a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).
	This is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
	comp.os.os2.bugs.

	This document contains:
	*  the background showing the need for these proposals
	*  the proposed charters for these proposals
	*  voting instructions
	*  a voting ballot
	*  some example ballots
	*  the voting rules
	*  the voting schedule
	*  the Mass Acknowledgement


Background:

	The creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2
	and emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
	a continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such
	as emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and
	much more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,
	allowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.

	Much of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and
	later, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the
	number of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility
	with their hardware increases, as does the questions on the
	availability of drivers for their hardware, installation
	procedures, etc.

	Multimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows
	Multimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is
	including direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version
	2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).

	Any non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,
	especially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.
	So far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks
	(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or
	for free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read
	comp.os.os2.misc for details).


Proposed Charters:

	(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
		as to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and
		spur additional development.  The group will also cover
		topics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,
		Windows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program
		portability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and
		so forth.

	(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

		To keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy
		orthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

		comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
		for OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
		technical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.

	(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

		It will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the
		availability of device drivers, compatibility information,
		installation procedures, system requirements, and overall
		performance optimization.

	(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.

	(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

		It will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug
		diagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system
		patches and corrective service disks, and so forth.

		[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
		newsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in
		comp.os.os2.beta]

Voting Rules:

	* One vote per person.  If you vote more than once, only the most
	  recent vote will be counted.

	* Votes must be mailed to me by the person voting.  Proxy voting,
	  forwarding, posting votes to a newsgroup, etc. will not be counted.

	* Do not ask how the votes are going.  The status of the votings
	  will be revealed only after the poll closes.

	* I will acknowledge votes by Mass Acknowledgement (ACK).  I will
	  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).

	* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how
	  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.
	  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is
	  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

	* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
	  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

	* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal
	  passes if both of the following formulas are true:
	  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes
	      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).
	  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the
	      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).
	  In other words, a proposal passes if:
	      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)
	  where max() returns the highest number given to it.


Schedule:

	The voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted
	by David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

	This third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the
	Mass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who
	have already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you
	have not voted yet, vote now!

	The voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on
	April 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.
	The voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
	date.

Running MS-DOS or a derivative OS, obviously. Please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens, but a slightly simplified
explanation.

Technically, the IRQ line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter, SoundBlaster, modem, hard disk, ...) to signal the CPU that
""Something's happening here, please take note."" How the CPU is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
In MS-DOS, the ""interrupt vector"" is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

Now, basic DOS doesn't care whether the printer reports that it's ready
to print some more stuff or not - it simply ignores the interrupt.  When
DOS prints, it looks at the LPT buffer.  If there's a character there,
wait a while and check again.  If there's not, copy a new character to
the LPT port.  Since the IRQ 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt, it's
free for use for any other adapters - in this case, the SB. 

With any multitasking or otherwise advanced OS, this kind of printing
approach just doesn't work (or more precisely, it wastes a lot of CPU
cycles.) Hence, you can't ""share"" the IRQ 7 with LPT1 and SB if you're
running Unix or OS/2 or whatnot.

Another issue with the SB is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. When the SB plays plain music, the CPU simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. With digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the CPU when the output ends and new data is
needed.

You can, however, hook two (or more) COM ports to one interrupt, but use
them only one at a time.  This is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports, and it can see from which port the data came
from. This, of course, applies for some other devices (like LPT) as well.

Remember, this was greatly simplified in parts, but I think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

Cheers,

That's nonsense!!  You can use ISA cards in an EISA-system without problem
and at the same speed as in an ISA system!!

I read sometime in the last couple of weeks, an article which desribed how to play PC sound
through a soundblaster. I didn't save the article and all old articles have been purged from
our system here. 

Would whomever posted the article detailing where to connect the wires please re-post?

Specifically, I need to know where to connect wires from the PC speaker to the SB card.

Keywords: Maxtor 340, Adaptec 1542, SCSI
Organization: University of Zurich, Switzerland
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]
Lines: 53

Please help if you can with the following strange problem:

  The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to
  time, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can
  tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOS
  reacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed or
  something the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproduce
  the error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes
  less. The last time it happened was when I wanted to 
  demonstrate some software to a colleague.
    I would like to know if anybody has experienced similar
  problems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealer
  only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. I
  checked the other post in this group about Maxtor, and
  I don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,
  no one describes the same problem, and I also have a

I'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:
I need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F)
plus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windows
program that will work on these.

My intended system will have 32Mb RAM so
plain ISA controllers will no longer do.
But I also hear that the SCSI world
is not very organized.

So does anybody have a tape backup setup
like what I'm looking for ? Please
describe it.

Thanks. e-mail please.

Organization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Lines: 36

NNTP-Posting-Host: pesto.mit.edu

Hi
	I have an Orchid Fahrenheit VLB with 2MB of DRAM.  It is an S3
86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from
them, so I guess I should be glad they didn't just say ""Buy the memory
from us"" or something like that.)

	The one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB
of memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
Just ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn't have bothered.  I
asked them why, and all I got was ""Your point is well taken, but
Orchid's software developers are busy with other projects.""

	So, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to
get another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my
system and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're
broken.

	If you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are ""less
busy"".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),
although evenn that might be a misprint.

	Please, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out
there, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I
coulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.

Thanks.

Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.

Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?

If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.  
As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more 
than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in 
the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is 
at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker?  

Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the 
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either
the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head
assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may
need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor
is out. 

If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for
repair.

I have had a SCSI and IDE drive working together for some years now.
SCSI is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
(ESDI,RLL,IDE,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
to get it to work with odd environments.

For information purposes, I had:

ST-01 Card + ST296N drive and a MAXTOR 212a drive with generic IDE
controller running together. I have also had the same SCSI setup work
in combination with a RLL drive, the ST251-1 drive.

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!

V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making 
cards to fit in the other two. 

How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at
130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1Mb/s.

[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]

Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!

  The one I got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (VGA/MCGA) mode,
which is almost identical to the other W5186 based cards (ATI 68800
does about 6kb/s).  This is weird since the Orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and I was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
since the VGA chip is covered by the Orchid label, I can't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
Winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a Viper (34 vs ~38) using
standard palette.

  BTW if anyone is insterested, I'm trying to sell a Diamond Viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (I'm too broke to
take it myself).

>Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?

  I think it's available in limited quantites.  No idea of what VGA
chip it uses though.

  Be very careful with OEM P9000 boards though, the Orchid I got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
documentation, and conflicts the hell with my VLB controller 
card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an A.I.R. 486 VLB)

Today I recieved a in-warranty replacement for my

changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled JP5.
(The card is revision 5A)

My detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects/disconnects the BALE line on the 64-pin part
of the ISA bus.

The question I have is simple:
To those people who own this revision of the Speedstar 24X,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does?

To anyone with an ISA-reference, what is the function of the
BALE line?

On a related note:
Are there any FTP sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the ISA bus?  My motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
chart, but that is it.

pin 6 (5.25""/3.5"" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2K2) on pins
8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.
The computer doesn't complain about a missing FD, but the FD's light
stays on all the time. The drive spins up o.k. when I insert a disk,
but I can't access it.
The TEAC works fine in a normal PC.

Are there any points I missed?

Thank you.

Ok, so I've heard about Comtrade, Gateway, TC, and various others.  What
about your impressions/dealings with Dell, Ariel Design, Austin, Insight,
Royal, and HD computers?

Can anyone share their experiences, good or bad, with a Tempe vendor
named Motherboard Warehouse?  I'm considering purchasing one of their
486dx2/66 boards.  One of the selling points is their 10 day full money

   I have a 386DX clone, with a DTC ESDI controller and Toshiba 660
mbyte
drive. Since installing DOS 6.0, when I tried to re-install software
from
5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when I mount the second..third..fourth disks, DOS
6
doesn't recognize that I have changed floppies. If I do a ""DIR"", I see
the
contents of the previous diskette. The only way to get DOS to recognize
that
diskettes have changed, is to do a ""label"", and then to not label them.

   Buying DOS 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. DOS 5.0 was stable, and
worked
well with my equipment. I have Superstor Pro, and DESQVIEW/X ( with
QEMM, 
Manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of DOS 6 that I am using. I
guess
I should roll back to DOS 5.0 but I am wary of what will happen when I
do it.

   Besides, like a fool, I don't have a DOS 5. bootable disk anymore.
I've
made the same mistakes I caution my users not to make. Like sheep, I
joined 
the crowd flocking to DOS 6. Baaa Baaad system administrator.

I totally agree with your friend, since when the CPU is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).  

The exception to this is for CPU's used in laptops, where the CPU can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing.  In this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

         No cache, also called 386DX.

     It has the same internals as the 386, is a real 32-bit processor, just has
     16 bit hookup to the outside world.

            Nope.  Just another name for the 486.

No, but some OS's ( COHERENT , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the IRQ. In your example, after accessing the
modem, the mouse won't work until you reboot, because the IRQ is used by
the modem.

Yes, you can change the IRQ's for com3/4, but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses IRQ4, com2 IRQ3.  If you have only one printerport 
( IRQ7 ), you can change com3 to IRQ5 ( normally 2nd printer ). For com4,
you can assign IRQ2, if its free. As far as I know, no other IRQ can be
used until your I/O-card is 16bit and caould access IRQ's > 8.

I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get

I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the
drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly 
flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).

Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.
I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers
would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!

It first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!

I'm not sure about DOS, but many multitasking OSs have an loop like this


loop:
	is there anything to do?
		YES -> do it; goto loop
		NO  -> goto loop


The CPU is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

It will also respond to interupts...

If you only do read/print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90% of the time even if it is efficient.

The truth is that int 15H joystick reading IS slow. I read it directly
from the hardware port. Note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts, so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. Don't just turn interrupts off, it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

Here is an example of how to do this:

Okay, here is my configuration:

80486-33 Gateway 433C Micronics ISA
12MB RAM 
WD212MB IDE HD ( drive C: )
ST3144A 125MB IDE HD ( drive D: )
Adaptec SCSI 1542B controller, with SCSI BIOS enabled
Seagate ST296N 80MB SCSI drive

Alrighty, when I boot up I get the Adaptec BIOS message, but it says
something like:

""Drive C: installed""
""Drive D: installed""
""ADaptec SCSI BIOS not installed!""

And I can't get to the Seagate drive.

I go into PhoenixBIOS setup, remove the entry for drive D:, and BOOM, I can
access the Seagate.  Is there a way to get two IDE drives and the Seagate
at the same time?  I have ASPI4DOS.SYS, but it just hangs the system.

I am trying to get my system to work with a Tandberg 3600 + Future
Domain TMC-1660 + Seagate ST-21M MFM controller. 

The system boots up if the Tandberg is disconnected from the system,
and of course no SCSI devices found (I have no other SCSI devices).

The system boots up if the Seagate MFM controller is removed from the
system. The Future Domain card reports finding the Tandberg 3660 on
the SCSI bus. The system then of course stops booting because my MFM
hard disks can't be found.

The system hangs if all three (Tandberg, Future Domain TMC-1660 &
Seagate MFM controller) are in the system. 

Looks like there is some conflict between the Seagate and Future
Domain card. But the funny thing is that it only hangs if the Tandberg
is connected.

I have checked that there are no conflict in BIOS addresses, IRQ & I/O
port. Have I missed anything?

I am lost here. Any suggestions are most welcomed. Thanks in advance.

Delman.

From what I've seen in coursework, most CPUs never actually
""idle"".  They will continue to service interrupts, etc.,
etc.  The clock will always be running at n Mhz no matter
what it's doing.

I suppose depending on the instruction, the CPU may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions, but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the CPU's
packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate
environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
negligible.

No, VL-bus IDE is no faster than ISA IDE.  The IDE interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the ISA bus, and if
you hook it to VL-bus it'll work as fast as the slower of the two,
meaning ISA speed.

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

#:#:#:#:#:#). I have never run across an Ethernet controller that
cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it.
DECNET requires this feature.

However, that said, there is no reason to ever change the Ethernet
address.  They are globally unique, the first three bytes being
assigned to the manufacturer by the IEEE, and the last three by the
manufacturer.

Subject: Upgrading the processor on 386/486 machines
Organization: Harvard University Science Center
Lines: 43


In case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money, I looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as I understand them).

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 or Model 80, you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a Cyrix 486DLC chip for $130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60% for normal fuctions, and not at all for math functions.
This chip will only run at your original clock speed, ie. if you have a 16MHz
machine the Cyrix 486DLC will run at 16MHz.
note: Windows does not use the math functions, so it is a good upgrade if
you are running Windows.
Or, 2) you can get a Kingston 486/NOW platform for $450 with a 25MHz i486SX
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100%, if you
were running at 25MHz originally. But again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
There is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX
on it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.

If you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX
or a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,
then you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and
replace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for
both normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip
costs $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the
25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the
Overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a
20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally
and 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.

You should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.  You might want to shop
around as prices do vary.  If you need a name/phone number for a source for
a particular chip, e-mail me, and I will respond with a couple of sources.

He's right ya know.  I've helped to install Dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
mine included.  On one, he bought the Stacker to Doublespace converter,
and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).

In other cases, I've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
Seems to work for me.

Well, I ran the normal SETUP thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
worth.

Couldn't agree more.  On my 486-50 I don't miss the speed.  It's still
faster than a normal disk read would be.  As for the less compression,
I've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else.  With Stacker, any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

Personally, I'm waiting for Stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff.  Plus, the DEFRAG that comes with DOS is okay, but I
much prefer COMPRESS from PC-TOOLS for sheer bells and whistles.  Plus,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

Subject: ISA GRAPHIC CARD INFO SOURCE
Organization: Universite de Montreal
Lines: 38

HI,
 that might look like a dull request, but I have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and It didn't help me make my mind.

  I bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while (I have been running on an xt 5MHz till last january!!).
The machine I bought came equipped with a ATI VGA XL 24 graphic card. It
gives a very nice picture and the  Windows drivers are pretty stable. The only
problem is that it is quite slow.

I would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). I saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice. My question is : Could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
I would like to get information about :
     - the refresh rates the various cards provide;
     - quality of windows drivers;
     - standard vga performance (non-Windows stuff).

Direct me to a magazine article or something like that (I got winvid.zip 
info, but it is not enough). If you have an ISA card you are really satisfied
with it,  let me know.
	If this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:
	- Fujikama 486 33MHz ISA system (Contaq motherboard)
	- monitor DARIUS 14"" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024X768) 
                               (can reach 70kHz horizontally)  

I would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the EPROM of the
graphic card. This is the case with my ATI card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings.

Merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,

I have a quick question regarding the Rockwell Chipset

are bugs in the chipset.  I know someone that has a ZOOM
14.4 Modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.

What's the word on the chipset?  Is this a ROM bug specific 
to a specific brand using the Rockwell, or is it the Rockwell
chipset itself?  And, if it is the Rockwell chipset, what 
are the chances that if I buy one of these modems (using the
Rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a ROM
change will fix/compensate for the bug?

     No, you need not bypass the config.sys, in Dos 6.0, there is a function 
of multi-config, have you tried BOOT.SYS ? the multi-config is the kind that 
you can choose you config.sys at the startup. And I find that is very good. 
It has no conflict to QEMM. (I have problem when using BOOT.SYS)
    The key you say is F8, which is trace the config.sys step by step.
    Sorry, if any error :)

I ran into this about six months ago.  My system is a GW2000 486DX/66V,
8 megs RAM, 1Meg ATI GUP VLB. It seems the problem is that the ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro card consumes the COM4 port for some reason, so only
COM1-3 are available.  I believe this is documented somewhere in the
system manuals, but I can't recall where.

Hi there,
 
I have a problem here, I've lost the software drivers and

I have a Hardcard II XL50.

This chip would take 25ns to return valid data after being issued an address.

Refresh time (none for SRAM, as you pointed out) is a different parameter,
and is not generally referred to except by motherboard designers.

Since there is no BIOS support for ST-506 interface hard disks in an XT,
that support must come from a BIOS extension ROM on the (MFM/RLL) hard disk
controller. Usually the controller has a ROM-based low level format
program (a common jump address is C800:0005 ... you can type G=C800:5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it ""knows"" about.
Sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card, sometimes you
can enter them manually in the LLF menu. Failing that, you must use a
third-party HD prep program like SpeedStor, Disk Manager, or the like.

IDE drives come formatted already, and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself, concerns about geometry are irrelevant. Plug
it in and go to FDISK.

I hate to burst your bubble but you cannot ""slip in a B:"" to that
particular AMI BIOS setting. That setting only allows you to set
the *boot order* of the floppy A: with respect to the primary HD C:,
i.e., check A: first, then C: or check C:, then A:.

 A few weeks ago I saw an ad in the German magazine c't
about a so-called Videostreamer. This is an interface
between a PC's parallel port and any video-recorder for
backing up your data on a videotape. The company (DataSave?)
claims that it can store up to 7 GB on a 300 minutes tape.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^

It costs DM 250.- (about USD 200, I think)

My question is:
 Does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes 
 REALLY fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 GB sounds quite
 unbelievable to me). 

However, any comments on the interface are appreciated.
Please mail your replies directly to me, I will sum up
if neccesary. Thanks in advance...

Yes, You bought the WRONG SIMMS.....You need 1X36 or 4X36, which are 72 pin
SIMMS.....These are better anyway becuase the send/receive data in 4byte
(32bit+4bit parity, one for each byte) Chunks. You will undoubtedly see these
SIMMS becoming more widely used in the near future.

No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are
drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like
486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K
of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real
estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its
486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become
available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other
companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out
with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).

Hello world,
 
I'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an IBM PC for teaching
purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings
of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for
example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 AND 1 = 1) so that the
students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally
logical, for example. Every instruction should show some 'working',
and not just alter register/memory/port contents.
 
Does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,
in Pascal or Modula-2, that would show me where I'm going wrong
in writing my simulator? [I'm using Ayala's -The 8051 Microcontroller-
as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
for simple teaching purposes, I feel, and there's no source code to help
you roll your own.]
 
Please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more

H E L P !

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:

	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
	files=30
	buffers=30
	stack=9,256

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means? 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try
anything.

Is VLB busmastering bad because it stops the processor fetching from
external cache as well as main memory while the VLB card has the bus?
How significant is the slowing effect?

Hello,

   I have a Diamond Stealth VRAM card (the older version
with the DIP switches on the back).  I have two problems:

1 ) I've lost the manual!!!

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when
    the network connection dies.

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)


    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following
as possible:

a ) Send me the Diamond BBS number
b ) E-mail (or post) the DIP switch settings for the card
    (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
c ) Tell me what I'm doing wrong, so I can magicly get
    everything working.

    Any help at all would be much appreciated.

I believe that any VL/EISA/ISA motherboard that uses the HINT chipset
is limited to 24-bit EISA DMA (where 'real' EISA DMA is 32-bit).  The
HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this
reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look-
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA
DMA.

Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using
mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).  Also with Adaptec 1742a
EISA SCSI host adapter.

Organization: University of Massachusetts, Amherst

Reply-To: David.Todd@Psych.UMass.EDU
NNTP-Posting-Host: titan.ucs.umass.edu

I'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:

486-33 DX, 16 mb of ram
on a Novell 3.11 network
Monitor:  NEC 4FGe, capable of 76 Hz vertical refresh rate

Major considerations:

I expect I will work mostly in windows, but with some DOS
applications and I would want decent speed in DOS.  I do mostly word
processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.

With a 15"" monitor, I expect I will work mostly in 800X600 and 256
colors seems plenty, but I'd like like the image to be sharp, fast,
and rock solid.

Other considerations:

I sometimes run a Unix clone (Coherent) and I understand that some
companies (e.g. Diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
development of drivers.

I might move to OS/2 if I decide I need better speed and reliability
than I get with Windows for my database work and multitasking.

I don't have a local bus motherboard--I'm not sure how much to invest
in an ISA video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

I like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

If you have any advice for me, I'd love to hear it via email or post.

Thanks.

I have been using both IDE (or MFM) and SCSI drives for years.  I have 2
IDE and 1 SCSI on one system and the other with 2 IDE, 2 SCSI disk, and 
1 SCSI CDROM.  I currently using ALWAYS IN2000 SCSI card, but I also have
a Future Domain, a Western Digital SCSI card, and I work with an ADAPTIC 
before.  As I recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
However, to use with other controller (IDE, MFM...) the boot drive has to
be the IDE (or MFM).  You CAN NOT boot from the SCSI if you have other 
controller in the system.  If you guys only have 2 drives (1 IDE, 1 SCSI).
just set up the IDE in your CMOS setup.  Make sure you can boot from it.
Then, set up the SCSI controller (IRQ, DMA, etc). Set the SCSI drive to 
ID 0.  Just plug and play for all the cards I seen so far.  Only if you 
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on.  If you have more question, email me, I will try to answer it.
Good Luck!

Hi,
I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and would
like to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-level
format, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up the
parameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowing
what this does.
The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.
I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and not
the nominal 80MB.
Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actual
parameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them?
And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM

	You got suckered in the same way I did.  Silly me, believing
	that the ""250"" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.
	The people who do this sort of thing for a living call it 
	""marketing.""  Lawyers who prosecute it call it ""fraud.""

	This is a bit long.  My system takes about 45 minutes to do 
	the same thing.  Usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape 
	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for 
	the write is too small.  Is there any way to change the block 
	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?

	This is because the files are opened by DOS.  The files in the 
	TAPE directory are likely the executable file or the configuration
	file for the tape system.  I would recommend running the backup
	from DOS so it will make a complete backup of the TAPE directory.

	The 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive
	won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.

: Telix.  Ideas and info gladly accepted.)

I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a ""DB-25"" but IBM has set an alternative ""standard"" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the ""connection"" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract ""escape""
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
""gotcha"" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.

Does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.

I currently have a 386 pc with  Future Domain scsi board  and  2
Maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  They work great, I haven't had
any problems!

Well, now I want more disk space and went out and  got   another
(larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all I had to do was add it
to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.

That didn't happen.  When the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
0/target1/target2].  All three disks are seen.

When I run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, I choose to
select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
The first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
no-where to be found....



ARGH!

Ideas anyone?????

Thanks in advance!

Which bus???

I think there are several reasons :-

50MHz motherboards are harder to get right
50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus
66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things


With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

What do I have?

A DX50 of course!

Hello,

I'am almost ashame to ask this question. It really looks like a FAQ, but couldn't
find the answer. Anyway...

The original IBM-PC/XT 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
keyboard around. Function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
etc. Is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 AT clone?

I do understand that the new AT keyboard has more functionality. I.e. the
typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. It seams to me that the pins &
electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
Maybe the communication protocol is different? 

Please answer by e-mail. Also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
In that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.

Thanks,

Duco

Hi all.

I've been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several
terms that I'm not sure about.

1.) Hard Sectored/Soft Sectored -- What's the difference?  How do I know
which to use?

2.) Head Skew & Cylinder Skew -- I understand that these are related to
performance... How do I know what's optimal?

My drive is an ESDI drive, if that makes a difference in discussing
these terms.

However, also be aware that Implementor's notes are basicly

point is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and
therefore 'noise' on the bus.

Les,

	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim ""low
emissions"" but not specifically ""MPR-II Compliant"" or ""MPR-II Certified""
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

I just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
My 2 cents worth:

The speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker. 
A speaker being a coil, it's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

Turbo switch.   There are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active- with the switch pushed in or the switch out.    I think
the middle wire is common.   Use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in, and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out.   Place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

LED's:   (Turbo and HD)  LED's are uni directional.  Depending which
way the wires are attached the LED will not light.  On my AMI motherboard,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board, the board will power up in default in Turbo mode.   If your motherboard
is like that... just attace the LED wires to the board.  If the LED doesn't
light, power off, reverse the connectors and try again.   It should work.

If it does, then attach the turbo switch to the board.

Hope this helps.

There are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work.  The C: drivemust be set to be the master drive, and D: must be set to be the slave drive.

Doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of WinBench
before blindly running it? The licence agreement very clearly says
that details about hardware configuration, driver, resolution and
other relevant facts *MUST* be included when giving WinMark results.

Ziff-Davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes
sense, really! Plain numbers are useless when resolution, driver and

How about 250MB/s for 64-bit VLB or 350MB/s for QuickRing {Apple's

it allows interleaving with other card so that the 350MB/s can be divided

IDA can't handle VLB speed never mind QuickRings's speed so it is out.
EISA pokes along at NuBus Mac II speeds {~15MB/s burst mode: 33MB/s}
 so VLB and QuickRing are slowed down by it.
PCI is a competing interface that is still in development.

I went out and bought the PAS16 yesterday, and installed it into my Gateway
DX2-66V. I followed the instructions and set the SB side with DMA 1 and IRQ5
(the default) and then the PAS side with DMA 5 and IRQ 10. My question is how
should I configure for MPU-401 compatibility. The manual and installation
program recommended IRQ2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to
IRQ8-15. So can I still use IRQ2, or should I choose a different one? Right now
I have the MPU-401 emulation mode turned off. Actually what is this ""cascade to
IRQ8-15"" business?  

A related questions (to other GW or VL-bus machine owners) I was told that 
only DMA 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit DMAs, and 0-4 are 8 bit DMAs. Now what about
32-bit VL-bus mastering DMAs?? Which DMA channel(s) is used by the VL-bus
extension to do 32-bit DMA?

Yet another question, after installing PAS16, my Links (golf game) will hang
the machine when I select SB mode and run, but works with Adlib mode??
Civilization however works fine ( at least so far). Any body knows what I might
have done wrong? 

Thanks (I am obviously a newbie) -- John

kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  
it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  
all I'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  
of drive is this? I don't have the numbers for this drive.

4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  
think that IDE drives can't be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?

Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I'm forgetting? 
Any help is *really* appreciated, I'm lost...

The courrier will not run at 16800 only the Dual Standard HST (the USR

ALL this shows is that YOU don't know much about SCSI.

SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5MB/s
and that is ALL you have right about SCSI
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PC use this set up too.
SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 
By your OWN data the ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI"" is correct
With a SCSI-2 controller chip SCSI-1 can reach 10MB/s which is indeed
""20% faster than IDE"" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. ALL these SCSI facts have been
posted to this newsgroup in my Mac & IBM info sheet {available by FTP on 
sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as 
mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (It should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}

Part of this problem is both Mac and IBM PC are inconsiant about what SCSI
is which.  Though it is WELL documented that the Quadra has a SCSI-2 chip
an Apple salesperson said ""it uses a fast SCSI-1 chip"" {Not at a 6MB/s,
10MB/s burst it does not. SCSI-1 is 5MB/s maximum synchronous and Quadra
uses ANsynchronous SCSI which is SLOWER}  It seems that Mac and IBM see
SCSI-1 interface and think 'SCSI-1' when it maybe a SCSI-1 interface driven
in the machine by a SCSi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {Which is MUCH
FASTER then true SCSI-1 can go}.

Don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.
One reference for the Quadra's SCSI-2 controller chip is 
(Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc, you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed, but it manages.
when booting is finished, plug in your floppy drive, now it will work.

(ok I know this is not very user friendly, maybe you are better off
buying a 486-66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)

I have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
Gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  It sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  Is your memory aperture above
16M?  I have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that SCSI card with a
variety of systems.  Call up Gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it.

Howdy,

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,
and a high-density 3.5"" floppy.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5"" floppy, which will read, but NOT
WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs.

I have tried everything I can think of.

Any takers?

You shouldn't have troubles.  I have heard of machines having problems

Sure.  I have 4 70ns SIMMs in one bank and 4 60ns SIMMS in the other ( I 
have a 486 ).  I wouldn't recommend mixing speeds within a bank, just to 
be on the safe side.

Nanao's F-Series (e.g. F550i) and T-Series (e.g. T660i) monitors
are MPR-II compliant.  According to my little pamphlet, the T-Series
monitors are also TCO-compliant, whatever that is.

If your Gateway is equipped with a Western hard drive, then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan.  The Western drives
are notoriously noisy.  On the other hand, if you don't have a Western
drive, then maybe it is the fan.  There's not alot to do about it except
insulate around the cpu somehow.

Lines: 16

I am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any
real reviews of them. One of the cards the local stores are pushing is
the Genoa 8500 for $125-140. Apparently it uses a Cirrus Logic acc. chip,
but I don't know which one (GD5426?). One of the shops I've spoken with 
claims the card out-performs the Diamond Stealth 24 vl and the Orchid
Fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (S3 86C805 based), but that can't be true
if it is using the GD5426. I like the price of the Genoa 8500, but if it
lags in performance behind the S3 cards, I'll pay the extra $50 for one 
of them.

Any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. If I get replies via
email, I'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.

Thanks in advance,

Dear All,

	I am trying to get my standard connection going with KA9Q (PA0GRI113016)
and a GVC NIC-2000 ethernet card. I know that my router and modem is
working because I am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it.

	However, after a time, it crashes randomly. Help would be
greatly appreciated.

	I suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the PC.  I am
running with a 386SX/33, 2 MB Ram.  The Ethernet card is configured
for IRQ 5, ports 0x360-0x37F. 

	Thanks in advance. I know that it's not much to go on, but I
don't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry.

Please send mail.

the same symptoms appear.

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and

Most IDE drives that I have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed
circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which).  If your
IDE drive does not have a label, then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins).  If the receptacle
is center polarized, that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide
positioned in the center of one side, then you can identify pin 1 as follows:
look into the pins with the notch at the top, pin 1 is at the top right.  On
all drives I have seen this is toward the power connector.  As for which pin
is pin 1 on the controller, well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin.  Once you know which end pin 1&2 are on or pins
39 & 40 (the oposite end), then you are all set.  All you need to do is keep
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end.  You don't even have to look at the
cable itself.  Just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through.  Usually the
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually).  But
beware - many cable makers are not very careful about this - I have seen cables
with pin 40 being the one marked red.  Of course with non-polarized connectors
this doesn't matter - you can plug the cable in either way and YOU decide
which side is pin 1.

: Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.

: the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive
: and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

It doesn't matter what gets plugged where.  But it does matter how the drives
are jumpered.  There will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on BOTH drives.  One jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master.  If it is the master, then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present.  You will have to consult the 
docuementation that came with you drives.  If you do not have docuementation,
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one.  This kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself.  They will fax you complete info about the jumpers.  If you don't
have convenient access to a fax machine, then you can usually get voice
help.  Or post the specific question to this group.  (I probably won't be
able to help you).

Hey folks.

Is it possible to short out your CMOS chip?  I think mine is fried.
These are the symptoms...

I have to do the following to get my computer (a Gateway 486DX33)
to boot...

    Turn the power off

    Disconnect the battery to the CMOS chip

    Turn the power on

    Get into setup upon getting the CMOS configuration error

    Set up the CMOS

    Exit the setup with [F10]  (phoenix bios)

    Ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [F1]

The computer then boots normally.  Both hard drives are accessible
but the floppy drives are not.

I can back up over the network and such, but if I need to reboot,
I have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  If I
simply <Ctl>-<Alt>-<Del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.

Does this sound like the CMOS chip is fried?  Can I buy another one?
Where?

Thank you for your kind attention.

I have a 486DX33 ISA system with 4 meg.  I am using a Diamond Speedstar HiColor
video card with 1 meg VRAM and a standard CTX 14-in SVGA monitor.  When I am
running Windows, and I have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping
the program manager window), and I close the active application, window erasure
is very slow.  The part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,
very slowly.  This also happens when I iconify an application.

The HiColor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it
does not have an accelerator chip on it.  I am running at 800x600x32k.  Is this
slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there
something else that is bottlenecking the system that I am unaware of?

Hi. I recently switched my old Amiga 500 with a 486DX-50. My computer
configuration is :

486DX-50 Mhz. 8/256 kB EISA (Micronics Motherboard ASIC EISA 50Mhz)
16MB Ram

When I use Norton6.0 Harddisk benchmark, I get a Harddisk data transfer
about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1MB/sec. Is that good ? I thought
that with EISA I could get about 2MB/sec. 
Somewhere in the manual for my harddisk I have read, that some host 
adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk 
performance in that system, do I need that ?
A guy I know, gets a HD transfer about 1.2MB/sec, and he has an ST3283A and
a ISA 486DX-50, how can a ISA with the same system be faster ?

Is there anything that I can do to get a speedier harddisk ?

Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.

Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have

cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more

The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the

(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.

| Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come

***** Windows 3.1 enhanced mode:

     The Windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure DOS
and Windows for use with the Adaptec 1542.  However, just in case
something went wrong, I'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get Windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  Also, you may have noticed
that installing Windows 3.1 makes your PC run much slower, even when
you're not running Windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"".


* MSDOS configuration:

     The Windows install program adds the SmartDrive disk cache to your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.  If you follow the instructions,
you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with SmartDrive
(this is the default setup).  You'll also notice that your system runs
much, much slower -- in both Windows *AND* MSDOS.  See the section
called, ""Windows 3.1 runs slowly"", for some ways of speeding your system
up.


* Windows configuration:

     To get the Adaptec 1542 to work with Windows, make sure that the
""[388Enh]"" section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains the entry:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off

I believe that the Windows install program automatically adds this entry
to SYSTEM.INI, but I'm not sure.  If this doesn't work for you, you
might want to try adding some more lines:

	VirtualHDIRQ=Off
	SystemROMBreakPoint=false
	EMMExclude=A000-CFFF

(You probably don't need the above lines, though.)  The
""SystemROMBreakPoint"" entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like QEMM/386MAX (only needed if you use such programs).


* Windows 3.1 runs slowly:

     Once you do get Windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
your system is running much slower than before.  If it's not, it's
probably because:

     1. You happen to be using ASPI4DOS.SYS version 3.1 in your
	CONFIG.SYS file.  Congratulations -- this appears to be a
	winning solution.

     2. You are very lucky.  Whether your luck will hold out remains to
	be seen ....

If your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
definitely caused by Smartdrive with double-buffering.  According to the
Windows documentation, and the Microsoft technical note #Q81808
(""SMARTDrive Double Buffering Required with ASPI4DOS.SYS""), you must use
Smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  While this works, it really
slows down your PC; I once estimated that this slowed my PC down by a
factor of 5 (FIVE).  As I consider this unacceptable, I looked for other
solutions.

     Unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  If you
do, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run Windows 3.1.
What you can do is one of the following:

     1. Use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  It is my
	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in Smartdrive is caused
	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
	Smartdrive.

     2. Use a driver that provides ""VDS"" services (""VDS"" stands for
	""Virtual DMA Services"").  This is a standard, which is supported
	by Windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
	the 1542) to work with Windows.

     After trashing my hard disk countless times, I found the following
solutions, none of which require using Smartdrive (note, however, that I
am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *NOT* caused
by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  While the following
does not require Smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended, as this makes Windows run much, much faster:

1. If you do not have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, or you do not need ASPI
   functions (for controlling a CDROM, tape drive, more than two
   physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the SCSIHA.SYS driver to your
   CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   (Windows needs the ""/V386"" option.)  This driver MUST be loaded into
   LOW memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
   about 16-20K.  As of November 1992, the SCSIHA.SYS driver could be
   obtained from the Adaptec BBS at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
   still there).

2. If you need ASPI functions and have the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver, version
   3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the ASPI4DOS.SYS and SCSIHA.SYS drivers
   in your CONFIG.SYS file, e.g.:

	DRIVER=c:\ASPI4DOS.SYS
	DRIVER=c:\SCSIHA.SYS /V386

   Amazingly enough, the SCSIHA.SYS driver can also be loaded high
   (assuming you have DOS 5.0); I would have thought that this would
   crash my system, but it doesn't.  I asked Adaptec's technical support
   about this, and they said that loading SCSIHA.SYS high should be fine
   as long as ASPI4DOS.SYS is loaded LOW.

   On my system, NOT using SCSIHA.SYS with ASPI4DOS 3.0a would
   occasionally cause Windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
   Windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
   C:\WINDOWS\*.GRP files would be corrupted).  For me, these crashes
   usually occurred while making a different program from PROGMAN.EXE
   the default Windows shell, and vice-versa.  This is the reason
   SCSIHA.SYS may be necessary.

   I have absolutely no idea if SCSIHA.SYS is necessary with versions of
   ASPI4DOS earlier than 3.0.

   Note that many people can use ASPI4DOS 3.0 or 3.0a without
   SCSIHA.SYS; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  I consider
   these people lucky.  Others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.

3. In my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
   to upgrade to ASPI4DOS 3.1.  The SCSIHA.SYS driver is no longer
   needed.  Unfortunately, while you could get previous ASPI4DOS
   upgrades from the Adaptec BBS, the ASPI4DOS 3.1 driver is not
   available from the Adaptec BBS.  As far as I know, there are only
   three ways to get a copy:

      * You can buy the new (as of November 1992) Adaptec EZ SCSI driver
	kit, which supposedly includes ASPI4DOS 3.1 as well as other
	drivers, such as CDROM drivers.  I believe the list price is
	around $75.

      * If you already have a copy of an older version of ASPI4DOS, you
	can supposedly contact Adaptec to upgrade it to EZ SCSI for
	around $30.

      * A copy of ASPI4DOS 3.1 is included in Central Point PC Tools 8.0
	for MSDOS.  Note that the documentation and driver are stored in
	different directories.  Note further that only ASPI4DOS is
	included; the CDROM drivers and drivers to support more than two
	hard disks are not included.  This is where I obtained my copy
	of ASPI4DOS 3.1.

Note, however, that I am now getting occasional parity errors with
Windows.  In all probability, defective hardware in my PC is causing
this, as I upgraded my motherboard just after I found the above
solutions.  However, because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  I've run various
memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
problems.  This problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
show up only under disk I/O).  However, I'm mentioning this just in case
it isn't a hardware problem.


***** Floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:

     There are two possible problems with using the Adaptec 1542 with a
floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the Colorado Memory
Systems Jumbo 250:

1. Tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  The tape drive
   constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.

2. Tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
   (This problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
   However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
   I'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
   1542.)


* Tape backups/restores take a long time:

     If you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
have to adjust the Adaptec 1540/1542 ""bus on/off timing"" for best
results when using the tape drive.  Normally, while doing a tape backup
or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
only an occasional pause.  However, the default bus timing on the
Adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
start and stop, every few seconds.  This causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
This also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
than necessary.

     The problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy DMA to
transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the Adaptec uses DMA
to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  The floppy DMA needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy DMA, the tape drive stops,
rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
The default bus timing on the Adaptec (which is really DMA timing) is
""too large"".  For example, when a backup is done, data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
tape.  Because the default timing on the Adaptec ""hogs"" the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive.  As a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

     The solution is to change the Adaptec's bus on/off timing.  The
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
The ""bus on"" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  This can
be done in one of two ways:

* If you have ASPI4DOS, you can use the ""/n"" option.  For example, I use
  a ""bus on"" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that I use the
  following line in my CONFIG.SYS file:

	DEVICE=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4

  Note that there is NO space between the ""/n"" and the ""4"".

* If you don't have ASPI4DOS, your only recourse is to try to find a
  program called ""SETSCSI.EXE"", which is very difficult to find.  The
  reason is that Adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
  want this widely distributed.  I once asked someone who worked for
  Adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  If you have
  anonymous ftp access to the Internet, you could try using archie to
  hunt down a copy; I believe that there are a couple of sites that have
  it.  If you do find a copy, you run it like so:

	setscsi -n:4

  This adjusts the ""bus on"" timing to 4 microseconds.  Running
  SETSCSI.EXE without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
  factory defaults.

  Note that it seems that you cannot use SETSCSI.EXE if you use
  ASPI4DOS; SETSCSI.EXE crashed my system if ASPI4DOS was loaded.  I
  could use SETSCSI.EXE with SCSIHA.SYS, however.

Do not lower the ""bus on"" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
above 11 microseconds.  If you lower it too low, the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  For me, 4
microseconds works fine.  This value may work fine for you, or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

     Once you've lowered the ""bus on"" timing, tape backups and restores
should run faster.

     Also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
options that I have intentionally not described), unless you know what
you are doing.  Bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
starving memory refresh.

     A program called BUSTIFIX.EXE exists on the Adaptec BBS.  Unless
this has been upgraded since I last checked (which has been a while),
this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files.  This batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  However, when I tried
running this program with my 1542A, my system crashed.  At the time, I
was running SCSIHA.SYS, and I didn't check to see if there was a
conflict with it.  Maybe this old program works only with the 1542B,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542A?


* Erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:

     This ""problem"" may or may not exist.  Although it existed on my
system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
However, I've heard of other people having similar problems, and so I'm
mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

     Symptoms of this ""problem"", which persists even after cleaning the
tape head:

1. Backing up to tape encounters ""unusable sector detected"" errors,
   resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. Tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.

3. The tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
   Unlike the above-mentioned problem (""Tape backups/restores take a
   long time""), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
   this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.

4. Fastback Plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  Other
   programs, like Central Point Backup and the CMS Jumbo software
   (assuming that you have a CMS Jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
   tape drive, but Fastback Plus 3.1 cannot.

5. Too many tape read errors.

     Although I do not know what is causing this problem, I discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it.  A few months ago, I
upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
controller.  As I already had a floppy controller on the 1542, I
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  After a while, I
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard.  When I did this, the tape drive (a CMS Jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically, and Fastback Plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

     I don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
On the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542.  On the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542.  I did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables.  I don't know what the cause really is;
however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


***** Sound cards:

     Many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
this is typically done using DMA.  Like the tape drive DMA, the
Adaptec's DMA can conflict with the sound card DMA.  Unlike that of the
tape DMA, this ""conflict"" usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message).  What happens is
that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
Adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
parity error.  Usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

     I've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).

     Like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
Adaptec's ""bus on"" timing.  See the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done.  Note, however, that this may or may
not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error.  The software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  Disk caches, the
speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


***** Miscellaneous info:

     This section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  Much
of it is merely information that I've heard or read about, and have not
verified.  I believe that the following information is correct, but I'm
not sure.  Use it at your own risk.

* With QEMM 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the ""DB=""
  parameter (e.g., ""DB=2""), unless you are using the ASPI4DOS driver.
  If you don't, QEMM will crash/hang at bootup.  Although the QEMM
  manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
  a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the QEMM
  command line (at least, this occurred with the QEMM 6.00 install
  program -- I haven't tested any other version).  Earlier versions of
  QEMM probably need this parameter, but I'm not sure (I've never used a
  version earlier than 6.00).

  If you use ASPI4DOS, you do not need to give QEMM the ""DB="" parameter.

* Some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
  gigabyte in size.  To support hard disks with capacities over 1GB, you
  need to get a new ROM BIOS from Adaptec.  I'm not sure if this is
  still true of the latest 1542Bs being sold by Adaptec.

* To connect a CDROM drive to the 1542, you need a SCSI CDROM drive and
  some drivers.  Note that some CDROM drives have proprietary interfaces
  (non-SCSI); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  You have three
  choices for CDROM drivers (I have no idea how well the following
  solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
  information):

     1. You can buy Adaptec's EZ SCSI driver package, which lists for
	something like $75.  If you already have older Adaptec drivers,
	you can supposedly upgrade to EZ SCSI for around $30.  Contact
	Adaptec for details.  The EZ SCSI package supposedly contains
	everything that you need.

     2. You can buy the CorelSCSI! driver package, which is made by the
	same people that make CorelDRAW!  This package contains CDROM
	drivers, SCSI tape drivers, WORM drivers, etc.  I do not know
	the list price, but I've seen this package sold for around
	$80-$90.  Note that CorelSCSI! does not come with the ASPI4DOS
	driver, which is needed.  If you do not already have ASPI4DOS,
	you may be better off getting Adaptec's EZ SCSI instead.

     3. [This method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
	obsoleted by Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit, but I'm mentioning it in
	case someone already has these drivers.]  You can use the
	drivers in the Adaptec ASW-1410 kit (ASPI4DOS) and the ASW-410
	kit (ASPI CDROM drivers).  You will have to get a copy of
	MSCDEX.EXE (a high-level CDROM driver), if it is not included in
	the ASW-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
	boards.

* To use a SCSI tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
  how to talk to a SCSI tape drive.  Software that I've heard about are
  (again, like the above section on CDROM drives, I have no idea how
  well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
  following is secondhand information):

     1. Central Point PC Tools 8.0 for MSDOS supposedly supports a large
	number of SCSI tape drives.  It comes with SCSI drivers
	(ASPI4DOS 3.1) as well as Central Point Backup.

     2. The CorelSCSI! driver package contains a SCSI tape backup
	program (see the above section on CDROM drives for more
	details).  However, note that CorelSCSI! does not come with, but
	requires, ASPI4DOS.

* I've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:

     1. 1542 SCSI controller with hard disk ROM BIOS.
     2. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and Adaptec ASPI drivers.
     3. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS, Adaptec ASPI drivers, and
	CorelSCSI! drivers/programs.

  I imagine that Adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:

     4. 1542 SCSI controller w/BIOS and EZ SCSI drivers (including ASPI
	drivers).

* Those people who use Unix might be interested in a version of GNU tar
  for MSDOS that talks to a SCSI tape drive via the ASPI4DOS driver (you
  need this driver before you can use this program).  I've never used
  this version of GNU tar, but I've heard that it works (I don't know
  how well, though).  If you have anonymous ftp access to the Internet,
  a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:

	PD1:<MSDOS.DSKUTL>
	ASPIBIN.ZIP  67841 920131 Gnu Tar for SCSI tape drives, Adaptec 154xx
	ASPIPAT.ZIP  21206 920131 Patches for ASPIBIN relative to Gnu Tar 1.10
	ASPISRC.ZIP 221370 920131 Src for Gnu Tar for SCSI tape, Adaptec ctrlr

  I have no idea if a copy can be found on Compuserve; UNIXFORUM might
  have it, if any forum does.

* As far as MSDOS is concerned, the 1542A and the 1542B controllers are
  the same; with MSDOS, the 1542A should work as well as the 1542B.
  However, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
  there is at least one (NON-MSDOS) program that initially did not work
  with a 1542A, but did work with a 1542B (BSD386 -- a 386 version of
  BSD Unix).

* In case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my CONFIG.SYS file:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  Note that I'm using QEMM and ASPI4DOS 3.1.  If I were using ASPI4DOS
  3.0 or 3.0a, I'd probably have to use a CONFIG.SYS that looked like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  If I weren't using ASPI4DOS, I'd probably use something that looked
  like:

	FILES=40
	BUFFERS=40
	BREAK=ON
	STACKS=10,256
	DEVICE=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /V386
	DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS on RAM ROM DB=32 DMA=32 ST:M X=F800-FFFF
	DOS=HIGH,UMB
	DEVICEHIGH=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
	DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p

  However, if I used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if I
  planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, I would still
  need some way of changing the Adaptec's bus on/off times.  The first
  two versions of CONFIG.SYS take care of this, but this last version
  doesn't.

I can wait 'cos I've already got an accelerated card. It does 1280x1024 but
only 16 colour. You may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.

I only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing. For instance, I'll be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486DX-2 66 EISA, VLB board RSN. The performance difference (under Linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile. At the same time I'll be buying a new
graphic card and new SCSI controller. I'll be buying an S3 card 'cos they're
fast enough, I have X11 drivers for them and it'll have 2MB VRAM just like
a Weitek 9000 card. It will also be MUCH cheaper. When affordable 4MB cards
arrive, I'll buy one.

Over the last year I've done much the same. But now I need a 19"" monitor, more
memory (20MB just ain't enough), a GB disk (1.2GB and no space left...). Oh
well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-)

Then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that SCSI was so expensive on
PC's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the ISA bus.
(ie no one buys SCSI for ISA because ISA is slow)
Are you saying that SCSI on an ISA bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to IDE?

IDE is just a variant of the old IBM- MFM AT controller.  (at least that's
how it looks from a software point of view).  It was never meant to be
an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

Is there any argument that 
IDE can (or can't) transfer data from the IDE drive at least as fast as the

If data is going from one drive to another, and if SCSI has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the CPU or main
memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  As far as I know, IDE
can't do that.  But when the CPU wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that SCSI can grab data from both drives 
at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time?  Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?

A friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245
million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets
close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few
hundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?

So you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,
considering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or
tape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives
at the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.

But on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you
get more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI
choice really give them more performance than IDE?

>But, you bought your PC for
>expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.

True, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.

No argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the
best reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer
eventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single
hard drive system?

With all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that
PC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, 
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
partitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?

So the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this
really a problem?

After having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
I have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
have I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to/from the same drive.

That is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that
there is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.

>Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

But what about ""mysterious"" (and expensive) drivers to figure out?  At least
IDE doesn't require drivers that consume precious conventional (DOS) memory.

Windows Sources Magazine reviewed a number of 17"" monitors recently
and they too said that the Nanao T560i was the best monitor to get if
you had the money. But they also said that the Mitsubishi Diamond Pro
17 is the next best choice and that it has superb picture quality.
This monitor can be had for around $1070.

Has anyone actually seen any of these? I am also thinking of buying a
17"" monitor and was going to consider the Mitsubishi. If I remember
correctly, I think its viewing area is 16"" measured diagonally.

Hi,
I've got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel

I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from

but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is

I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card

I just talked to a rep for my AT&T mastercard regarding this:  There is no
maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
item needs repair.  If it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid
for it.
Curiously though, the AT&T Gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.
Definitely not upgrading to that card...:)

GCC and other big programs seemed to crash about 15% of the time for me.
gcc gave something like ""program as got fatal signal 11"" and when doing
anything past the complexity of elvis, kermit, etc, I got kernel general
protection faults at *least* once a session.

I disabled my cache as suggested, and bingo, Linux is as stable as a rock

Does any one know why the cache would do something like this?

There is a software version of MNP-5 available from MTEZ, and it will often

Subject: Re: Any info on Cyrix 486DRu2 chip?
Organization: Netcom - Online Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Lines: 64

It seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the Cyrix 386 compatible
486DLC and 486DRU2.  My info comes directly from Cyrix's Fast Fax service:
And also from installing one of these chips in an IBM Model 80.

The 486DLC is a 486 instruction set compatible CPU which fits into a 386DX
socket (Pin Grid Array, or PGA).  The DLC currently is available in 3 speeds.
the 25, the 33, and the 40.  They do not have a coprocessor on board, but any
software query will return coproc as present.  I guess they emulate the
coproc instructions.  Math functions are on the 386DX level without the
actual coprocessor.

The internal cache on the 486DLC is 1K.  Cyrix literature claims a 85% hit
rate.  My informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10% performance
boost when it is enabled by software.  Overall performance boost from a
386DX-25 to a 486DLC-25 is about 60%.  The benchmarks I used were NU SI and
QAPlus Dhrystones and Whetstones.  The performance, with the cache enabled,
is about on a par with my 386DX-40 with 256K external CPU cache, which is
around the performance for a 486SX-25.  The computer runs noticebly faster,
and DOS 6 with Dblspace is not complaining.  The company claims OS/2
compatibility, but I didn't test it.

The 486DRU2 is not a chip, as commonly thought.  The 486DRU2 is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386DX, which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler.  This board plugs into the 386DX
PGA, and the 486DLC-33 or 40 plugs into this board.  I guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the CPU, and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required.  There are no info available
from Cyrix there.  Anyway, the DRU2 is available for 386DX-16, and 386DX-20
only.  Double these clock rates, and you get the 32MHZ and the 40MHZ DLCs.
If Cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the DRU2-50, then they need
to put out the 50MHz DLC2 first...

I also tested a DLC33 motherboard, along with a Cyrix Coprocessor.  With 64K
external cache, performance were about 30% faster than the 25, but still
significantly (25%?) slower than an actual Intel 486DX.

IMHO, the DLC is a great, low price upgrade for people who can't afford, or
can't install, a new motherboard.  It is definitely worth what I paid for it,
but if you need 486DX-33 performance, the DLC33 won't cut it.  I'm not sure
about the DLC-40, but I think even if it matches the performance, it won't
beat it in any significant way.

The last time I posted info about the DLC, people sent quite a bit of mail,
asking where I got it.  So here is where I got mine:

Treasure Chest peripherals, they advertise in the Computer Shopper.
1-800-677-9781
The 486DLC-25 kit was $179.00

But....

I liked the chip so much that I found the supplier, and became a dealer.
If you are interested in the chip, e-mail me, and I can fax or mail you
more info.   I'm well aware of the net's policy against commercial use,
So I can;t post anymore info here.  However, if there are more questions
regarding the 486DLC itself, I'll post what I can.

The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest
but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.

I'd still like to here from people with VLB-IDE.
I still want to know what VLB bus speed is used with IDE drives.
I still want to know if some (most ?) IDE drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.

PS: A friend with a 286-20 and a new Maxtor 7245 (245 meg IDE) drive gets
between 800 - 1000 k/sec (can't remember exactly).  I think the bus is running
at 8 mhz in this case.

But, but, but... How does buying an external modem solve the problem
of wanting more than 2 serial devices at once?  And since the PC
only supports two, why are you blaming a modem vendor for the
problem?  I don't see how your experience could have been different
with any internal modem.

Hi!

I recently switched my 3.5"" drive to A:. The problem is, while I can read and
write to both the new A: and B: correctly, I can't boot from a floppy in A:.
I've checked the CMOS settings; it is set for Floppy Seek at Boot and Boot 
Order A:,C:. 

Once, I had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in A:. I got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. It didn't work.
When I do have a systems disk in the A: drive, this is what happens:
1) Power-on and Memory Test;
2) A: light comes on
3) B: light comes on, followed by a short beep;
4) HD light comes on for an instant;
5) B: light comes on again, then nothing happens

The light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen 
blanks. I can't even use ctrl-alt-del.

Any suggestions.

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I just bought a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive and a SB Pro soundcard.  The pin outs on
the CD-ROM line-out and the SB Pro CD-IN are not the same.  I am considering
taking the RCA output jacks on the Mitsumi interface card and routing them to
the line-in input on the SB Pro.  Will this work with multi-media software
that uses the CD-ROM and the SB Pro or do I need to go to the CD-IN pins on
the SB-Pro.

Thanks,

The Quantum LPS 240AT is supposed to have a 256K cache on the IDE
controller built into the card.  Yet when I do a DOS DIR command
on my system, the disk is always accessed (I can hear the mechanical
movement of the heads).  Why is this happening?  Strangely, even
when I have smartdrive installed, every DIR command accesses the
disk.  Did I somehow de-activate the cache?  This is happening on each

we are talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller.

Here is a rewrite of my Mac & Info sheet SCSI section:
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Normal {asynchronous}
 SCSI is 5 Mhz;  fast {synchronous} SCSI is 10 Mhz.  Difference between these
 modes is mainly in the software drivers.
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and end. 
 Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per SCSI controller.  asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  8-bit SCSI-2 is often mistaken for
 a fast version of SCSI-1 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: fully SCSI-1 compliant. SCSI-2 mode - 10 devices per SCSI controller.
 8-bit SCSI-2 is implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it can run using
 SCSI-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
 results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of SCSI-1.  16-bit
 and 32-bit SCSI-2 require different ports, electronics, and SCSI software
 drivers from SCSI-1 {Which makes them more expensive than other SCSI
 interfaces}.  32-bit SCSI seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
 'wide and fast SCSI' Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit},
 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit}.

8-bit SCSI-2 is the BIGGEST headache due to the fact that it is the ONLY SCSI-2 
that I know of that can pump SCSI-2 speeds through SCSI-1 devices and software
controlers.  Its MAIN implimentation is on the Mac though you do see adds
for SCSI-2 at 10MB/s maximum throughput for PCs.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 does NOT
NEED all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
SCSI-2 it is the CHEEPEST of the SCSI-2 interfaces.  Just pop out the SCSI-1
electornics and pop in 8-bit SCSI-2 electronics.  Some people consider
16-bit where SCSI-2 REALLY starts {I USED to be one of them} but
4-6MB/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10MB/s is NOT SCSI-1
but is 8-bit SCSI-2.
Rule of thumb: if it is SCSIn and OVER 5MB/s then it is SOME type of SCSI-2.

8-bit SCSI CAN use part of SCSI-1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2.

Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working
on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with
Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU
with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and 
Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong
with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to
access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C
code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that
will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.

I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code
that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I
am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack
of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.
I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and
then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received, 
the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do
nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses
the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt
int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )
the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )
and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as
to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

Hi,

I am going through a box of old IBM card and came across one called a

it and a big chip that has 'C-Cube' on it.

No connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board.

It is a 16-bit board.

Any ideas what it is?

Hello,

	I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have  
8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  
both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  
of running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  
that more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  
can see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  
$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  
the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  
the machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  
avoid...

So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  
well with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  
$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  
do they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  
extra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  
ISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  
appreciated.

Most XT IDE controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer.  The controller may
come with software to update its on-board BIOS, or may be designed to work
with a particular drive.  Seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on XT's, and these are tailored to the drive.

Also, you cannot low-level format an IDE drive.  The low-level format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called ""servos"" (not
like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than
the drive's recording heads can generate.  Don't try to low-level format an
IDE drive!

Annoying??? Are you actually using one or are you just talking? ;-)

I have a DFI Handy Scanner Model HS-3000Plus and a little bit of
software running under dos to use it. I'd like to make more extensive
use of this device (in particular, write a driver for it on unix).

So, can anyone give me a description of how to talk to this device. It
connects to the system via it's own interface card.

Any info would help, it can't be too difficult to talk to :-)

thanks, brian wallis...

I also have a DX2/66 and a Maxtor 212. I have a local bus IDE controller (generic) and I get
985 KB/s. I tried swapping my local bus IDE controller for an ISA IDE controller and my
transfer rate went to 830 KB/s. The specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
transfer rate of 2.83 MB/s. I dont know how to get there from here. The local bus interface
got me a little, but certainly not as much as I had hoped. I am also looking for a way to 
improve my disk performance, but Im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck
(although Im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). I am already running a big
main memory disk cache, so Im not really interested in this solution either.

Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC.  By this I mean of 
different types.  ie.  RLL and MFM.  If so how do you access the drives
in the CMOS setup.  Do they just show up to be configured or do you 
have to do low level writes to the controller.  

As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine.  Put
a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it.  I now have 4
drives with 2 controllers of different types.  Also can you 
put 2 controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access 
them.  

I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has
done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased

Thanx in advance for any info...

I've started to notice the same thing myself. I'm running DOS 5 and Win 3.1 so
I can fix it from the Windows Control Panel. At times it is the date, at
others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should
be.

If you find out I'd like to know also. Oh, and I also leave my system running

There are two 'problems':
(1) the BIOS TOD routine which updates the BIOS clock uses only 1 bit
    for day increment, so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
    will get lost if no one calls the BIOS to read the clock in the
    meantime, and
(2) the BIOS resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
    call from ANYBODY (after the wrap indicator has been set). So
    unless the first BIOS 'get date' call after midnight is done by
    the DOS 'kernel' (which is the only part of DOS which knows how to
    increment the date, the day wrap indication is normally lost.
My guess is that Kevin's 'menu' system uses BIOS calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time), and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. Even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which I think is indicated by a non-zero
value in AL), there really isn't any particularly good way to tell DOS
about it, so that DOS can update the day. The menu system 'should' use
DOS calls to get the time, which would cause the DOS 'kernel' to do
the BIOS call, and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly.  Possibly, though, the 'menu' system can't easily use DOS
calls for time, because DOS is not reentrant, and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other DOS call.

Anonymous,

I saw a posting about the choice between 80486DX-50 and a 80486DX2-50.
I was wondering: although a DX-50 is faster because of the path to it's
external cache, shouldn't the choice be the DX2-50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local-bus? I mean, cache speed is one thing,
but all your speed will be blocked during video I/O, so just get that
faster... 
I'm willing to speculate that the DX2-50 with local-bus will be 2-4 times 
as fast as the DX-50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ;-)!

Hello folks!

I have an Archive XL5580 (internal QIC-80) tape drive, which is pretty
comparable to the Colorado Jumbo 250.  Since I have two floppy drives in
my system, I'm using a small card (not accelerated) made by Archive to 
attach my tape drive as a third floppy device.

The problem: Although the DOS-based QICstream software works just fine,
both the Norton and Central Point backup programs for Windows fail unless
I switch the machine to non-turbo speed (I'm using a 486DX/33 EISA).  Since
the DOS software works, it can't be a hardware problem, can it?  Has anyone
seen similar problems?  Any solutions?  Thanks in advance.

Hi Netters!

I'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution.  After you read about
my situation, I'd like your opinion.  Here's the scenario:

1.  There are two computers in the house.  One is a small 286 (40MB IDE drive).
    The other is a 386DX (213 SCSI drive w/ Adaptec 1522 controller).  Both 
    systems have PC TOOLS and will use Central Point Backup as the backup / 
    restore program.  Both systems have 3.5"" and 5.25"" floppies.

2.  The computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

From what I have seen so far, there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (I'm sure there are others I haven't thought about).  For these 
options, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees 
any flaws (drive type X won't coexist with device Y, etc.) in my thinking 
(I don't know very much about these beasts):

1.  Put 2.88MB floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
    Can someone supply cost and brand information?  What's a good brand?
    What do the floppies themselves cost?


2.  Put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    continue to back up the 286 with floppies.  Again, can someone recommend a
    few manufacturers?  The only brand I remember is Colorado Memories.  Any
    happy or unhappy users (I know about the compression controversy)?
 

3.  Connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my SCSI adapter, and
    (maybe?) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions?)


4.  Install a Floptical drive in each machine.  Again, any gotcha's or 
    recommendations for manufacturers?  

I appreciate your help.  You may either post or send me e-mail.  I will
summarize all responses for the net.

Thanks,

George

The original poster, John Navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
a SparcStation LX. The LX is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
76 Hz. Not officially, but I tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the LX came up with a non-syncing screen. Our tube obviously couldn't
handle this speed. At 67 Hz, it worked perfectly.

When buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a SparcStation
LX, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76Hz.
I don't know for sure whether the LX supports this (Sun certainly won't tell
you) so you'll have to check.

Why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the ISA bus first?
You can quote SCSI specs till you're blue in the face, but if they
exceed the ISA bus capability, then what's the point?

Who says IDE is limited to 5 megs/sec?  What about VLB-IDE?  Does anyone
know how they perform?

Given the original question (SCSI used only as a single hard drive
controller),  is it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do
at least 5, maybe 10 megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence?
What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

(or PGA?) was $800.  SCSI has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price, mainly because we're talking about PC's and not Sun's or Sparc
or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

I won't argue that the SCSI standard makes for a good, well implimented
data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

Well, it all depends on the motherboard implimentation.

I'm sure someone will make a vlb motherboard that takes 1x9
simms and uses a pentium processor.  I'm also sure that there

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an

Subject: Do the 2MB ATI Ultra Pro 16 and 24 bit Windows Drivers Work?
Organization: University of Texas at Austin
Lines: 35

Hi there.  We just bought a 486 DX2/66 Gateway system with a 2 meg ATI
Ultra Pro video card.  Everything seems to work fine except for the
Windows Drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes.  The fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,
and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible.  Naturally, I called Gateway tech support to inquire
about this.  The technician asked me about the drivers, and I told him it
was version 1.5, build 59.  He told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ATI Ultra Pro simply do not work!!!  Is this true?  If so, I'm simply
amazed.  How could this be?  The strange thing is I would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the FAQ!!!).

One very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the Windows Accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers
for Windows 3.1.  I easily challenged him on that because I've been
running a Diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and I have
tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  He then backed off and said:
""Well, Diamond has been working on those drivers much longer.""  Anyway, I
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

The system configuration is:

Gateway 486 DX2/66 Local Bus
16 Megs Ram
SCSI HD & CD-ROM
Ultrastor 34F Local Bus SCSI controller
ATI Ultra Pro Local Bus with 2MB VRAM
DOS 6.0
Windows 3.1
Mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)

Thanks in advance.

The JP5 on the Speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.
If your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper
block from jp5. This will not affect the proformance of the SpeedStar 24x.
 
This is what my manual says about jp5. I never knew that it was there
but the card is a real ask kicker in my book. It beats the hell out
of my junk Sony 1604s to the point that I can't even use above 648x480
mode much...Sam
Some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a Sony
with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. Or installing 60ns simms and
then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!

a 286 upgrade would probably cost about $50, 386 about $150 or so.  
Coprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much.

Not completly true.  For AT class and later machines, IRQ5 is
reserved for LPT2.  Since it's rare to have a second parallel
port in a PC, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

On the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a Gateway computer (4DX-33V).  It has a Modem on COM1,
a Mouse on COM2, and the other serial port was set to COM3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as COM1).  We had a real fight
with a board when trying to use IRQ5, and discoverd the problem
was that Gateway had set it up such that COM3 used IRQ5.  As soon
as we disabled COM3, our problems went away.  Grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.

First off, with all these huge software packages and files that

Second, (rumor is) Microsoft recognizes the the importance of SCSI
and will support it soon. I'm just not sure if it's on DOS, Win, or NT.
At any rate, the deal is with Corel who makes (I hear) a good

Keywords: Ram,Trident,Interrupts

Hi,

I have a few enquiries about PC's and compatibles in general.. Some software
others hardware orientated.. (Probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone 
claims..)

Anyway..

1) Does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a Trident 8900
SVGA graphics card (1MB) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. Mine
already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor I found 
out which switch controlled the interlace/non interlace facility.. 

But I'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly
little use..

2) Secondly, does anyone know why Commodore had to be so crazed in their design
of the PC-40 motherboard with respect to the RAM.. (IE 512 + 512 or 640 +0K) ??

3) Can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit
) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...
(Yeah I know its a piece of cake.. I'm lazy 8)

4) Software wise.. Anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded RAM
on a PC (from a program written in Turbo C++).... 

For instance, using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available
from the base 640K regardless of combinations of EMM386 etc etc...
What I want is to be able to use the RAM above and beyond the 1MB boundary...

I'm not certain whether farmalloc / new actually uses it anyway but I'll 
suspect not .. 

5) Also.. what half brained wit created DOS so as not to be re-entrant??????
   As a follow on, does anyone have any comments about the use of DOS calls
   0 to 0C from within a DOS interrupt? Ie will changing the stack size on
   entry be of use.. Two articles I've read on the subject have given 
   conflicting views... Does anyone have any views on writing direct to
   screen memory in terms of portability?

Many thanks..
Gotta go, bars closing soon 8)

you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini.
in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the 
associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable
32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives
and controllers support it !

Yeah, there is absolutely no use for VLB except for video graphics.
And no IDE could possibly take advantage the VLB, because it runs at
8 Mhz and 16 bits. Do people forget that the IDE was specifically
designed to interface directly with the AT ISA bus? We've seen
IDEs come out for EISA, XT ISA, and now even MCA, but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard, running at somewhere near 8-10 Mhz. When
you run an IDE off of the VLB, there's no way that you're running it
at 33 Mhz, it would burn up. Of course same goes for SCSI, ESDI, whatever,
none of them run at CPU speed.

The only way to gain advantage with a VLB IDE is to hook it up to
a caching controller. I suspect it would be much, much better to
get a software disk cache instead, since you get write-caching as well.

>because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

I've seen some Fuji IDE drives going as high as 1G.

IDE does not do DMA.  This is because it's like te PC AT hard disk
interface.  The controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card, then the CPU moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it's needed.  If IDE doesn't work this way, then it's not
compatible.

Heck, if IDE used DMA, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
ISA bus systems with more than 16M RAM not working with their IDE
drives.  16M is the DMA addressing limit of the ISA bus, and if IDE
did DMA there would be trouble.

(BTW, there are DMA-enabling signals in the IDE cable spec, but the
last report I heard was that they are never implemented, because it
would require a different kind of IDE adapter and different drivers.)

don't believe everything you are told.  I can tell you that mixing them 
between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one 
bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that 
the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent 
configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit 
nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte 
).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent 
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM 
interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry 
if too techie for ya].

That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit 
wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?  
Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit 
CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data 
from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when 
it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard 
links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in 
this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means 
that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you 
have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide 
data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks 
are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data 
with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by 
one SIMM at a time.

Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your 
question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'

Most of these are single-scan monitors, which are useless for most
PC users.  I posted requests for information in other newsgroups which
were mostly fruitless, but I have managed to track down two multisync
grayscal monitors in the 17-21"" range, one 20"" and one 21"".  I am still

I am looking into a group purchase as well.

1. do not do a low level format on an IDE drive unless you have the
   executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  These are
   available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
   fee.

2. In addition to the master/slave jumper on an IDE drive there is also
   another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  Get it right!

3. The cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
   pin 1.  No twisting or swapping on an IDE cable.  Be sure of pin 1
   on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
   but assumptions are bad).

4. If the cable and jumpers are correct, and the CMOS setup is correct,
   then you may have to do an FDISK followed by a high level format.

   Try putting one of the IRQs for your COM ports onto IRQ2. The hardware will
automagically wrap IRQ2 to IRQ9 on AT class machines (eg, anything with high
IRQs). This is what I'm doing on my set up right now. 
   I've got COM2 on IRQ2 (really IRQ9 - address it this way in software), COM1
on IRQ3, SoundBlaster on IRQ5, LPT1 on IRQ7, and my ATI BusMouse port on one of
the interrupts in between. Works just great.
   If you need even more, there's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the
higher IRQs. It basically involves cutting the trace to the low IRQ and running a wire over the a high IRQ pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

  It will be best to put the modem's COM port onto IRQ2/9. This will be the 

first IRQ serviced by the system, giving the modem a better response -- 
especially handy under multitaskers like OS/2 -- which I'm running with no
problems.

Subject: Help on hand scanners wanted
Organization: University of Northern Iowa
Lines: 30

Fellow netters,

I'm in the market for a hand scanner.  However, I don't know anyone who has
one.  I have my eye on two choices.

Dexxa:  This scanner is available at Wal-Mart for $90.  It includes GrayWorks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (I think).  The OCR software
Catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.

Mustek:  (Gray Artist for Windows)  This scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to Cad & Graphics) and 800 dpi.  It is available for $169
mail-order and comes with Perceive OCR and Picture Publisher LE.

I am also looking at a Genius hand scanner (B105) from Cad & Graphics.  It
is basically the same as the Mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ($149).  

Basically, I would like recommendations on which to buy.  I have heard that
Logitech makes the best and manufactures Dexxa scanners.  But which one is the
best buy?  Would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than HP
LaserJet III or Canon BJ-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  I am leaning toward the
Mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices.  Which should I buy?

If you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it.  Also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under $225) that would be a better deal, please E-Mail me.  Any and all help
would be greatly appreciated.

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship

I remember reading somewhere (QEMM manual, I think) that

Otherwise, use STACK=0,0.

Hi Netters,

As promised, here are the summary of opinions on DoubleDisk Gold v.6.0.
People seem to be quite happy with the product. There is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.
(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although
just as reliable - BYTE Magazine's conclusion ;-) ), so it's hard to make
any decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. 
However, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.

Hello Buddy,

I do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have
DD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.

Here is my suggestion...

1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with
	DOS 6.0's compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that
	for $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other
	utilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you 
	are now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)

2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95
	for the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I
	decided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!
	I have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with
	large SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It
	works great.  Not delays.  I think the ""A"" is better than ""B"" 
	arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
	I am looking forward to being able to ""LOADHIGH"" the DD sw.  That
	has been an annoyance.

3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the
	effort to upgrade.

Just my $.02 ...

Regards,
Mark Bagdy

Buddy,

I got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The
documentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

There were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a
203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had
~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

I have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very
happy camper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	I have been using DoubleDisk Gold for a little more than a month on
a 486DX 33Mhz, 120MB Seagate drive, running DOS & Windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
	I ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a DoubleDisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
	I have no complaints about reliability.  It was very easy to install.
The only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game
was trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed
region of the disk.  Since then the game has never given me a problem. 
There was never any damage to the DoubleDisk drive.
	Compression performance for the whole disk has held steady 
around 1.8:1.  This is lower than expected but about 20% (size) of my files 
are compressed image files and some large zip files.  

If you have any more specific questions let me know.
Dan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I bought it an have been happy with it.  I use it on both MFM and IDE 40
MB drives.  I was using DoubleDisk before Gold came out.  That is the
same product MSDOS 6.0 is shipping with.  No problems with either
product.

G'day All,

I was looking to build a Parallel Port Digital to Analogue Converter the other
day and came across this schematic which I promptly threw together on a piece
of VeroBoard:

(Please excuse the obvious limits of the Lower ASCII char set :=)

I have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey ABS box.

Unfortunately I can't get it to work... I have a little demo here by the name
of Cronologia (Which the schematic came from) and all I can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash/static with a small amount of music signal
behind it - it's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

Does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas/suggestions/
better designs/improvements/wastepaper bin... etc?

Many thanks for a reply via this conference or email.

There are no standards for PC COM ports above COM2.  While there are ""de

that gets about a 126 SI 6.0 CPU Benchmark rating.  Using
the 1024x768x16 color driver under Windows, I am getting a
Winbench Winmarks rating of only about 9.5 Million.  Since
I have heard that others get 15-to-16 million for this card,
I assume that something is very wrong with my setup.

What are some possible causes of the card slowing down like this?

it is being mapped to the fast XMS memory in my system through
EMM386.  What's going on there?

Note that my Stealth 24's video BIOS at C000-C7FF is being shadowed

Any ideas on what might be happening here?

On my 486DX-50 (really 50, not DX2), my AT bus is set to CLK/3.

At 16.67 MHz, I have no problems.  Soundblaster Pro, Zoom 14.4 FXM, RLL

If I set it to 2 (25 MHz), I simply don't get past the POST routines.

From: system@codewks.nacjack.gen.nz (Wayne McDougall)
Organization: The Code Works Limited, PO Box 10 155, Auckland, New Zealand
Lines: 60

Facts:
=====
- A Netware Server 286A was roughly moved to a new location and left powered
down for three months.
- From memory it has an 80 MB hard drive.
- Manuals and original disks are for SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a
- When powered up, the CMOS was wiped. A technician examined it and 
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

My investigations indicate that drive C is a type 27 (1024 cylinders, 9 sides).
When CMOS set this way, COMPSURF runs happily, with 13 bad blocks.

I use PREPARE to Hotfix the one internal drive.

Install will proceed ""successfully"", but when I try to boot the server, it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

Internal examination indicates that the keycard is present, and there is one
disk drive (or at least one large single unit). 

Attempts to configure a second drive in CMOS result in drive not ready
errors.

Questions:
=========
The software is Netware 286 Level II and I can see burnt on to the screen
SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a. However, to configure netware for level II
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this what
is causing my serialisation error?
2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives, one of
which has failed?
3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive?
4. What else can cause a serialisation error?
5. What happens if the keycard fails?
6. Am I doing something wrong? Can someone knowledgeable offer some comments
and guides.

Thanks for your time.

Apology:
=======
I appreciate that I have posted this request somewhat widely. As I'm
dealing with somewhat archaic hardware and software I'm hoping that by casting
my net further, I'm more likely to capture someone who has met this system
before. I believe I can justify the groups to which I am posting. Please
feel free to correct me if you feel this is an inappropriate place to post

Hi,

I have the following problem: I have to use a computer for special purposes
that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. No monitor isn't a 
program - but no keyboard.
I can't disable the keyboard from BIOS setup (in fact, there is no setup).
I spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the BIOS with simply
using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor.
Pity, pity... I lost contact to the person before getting more detail.
So does anyone of you experts can help?

Thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-)

Hi, all. This is my first posting, so be gentle...

I have a Zenith external floppy which has a DB25 connector, and I'd
like to use it with my Sharp and Toshiba laptops, which also take a
DB25 for their ext floppy, but it doesn't work.  I have the pinouts
for the Zenith, and would like to make adapters so I can use it.

Does anyone have pinouts for these or other manufacturers' DB25 ext

Subject: Gateway Telepath Modem -- getting v.32bis
Summary: I get garbage no matter what settings I try
Organization: Chinet - Public Access UNIX
Distribution: na
Lines: 29

I have had a Gateway Telepath modem for about a month or so now.
Actually, I had one that wouldn't connect to ANYTHING no matter
what software I used, so I got a new one sent to me.  This allows
me to connect to my favorite News system with ZERO problems.  So
I'm somewhat happier ....

But I still cannot connect to my favorite DOS bbs with any kind
of reliability.  I have success about 1/10 calls.  Not good!  I
would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least
ONE of my fave places means I just need to adjust it.

What I usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response
line on the dial window. Sometimes it will drop to full screen mode
first, then I get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  In both cases the
modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.

I am using DEFAULT settings (AT&F) and getting this problem.  I
am using the AUTOCONFIGURE settings that Gateway has supplied with
my copy of Qmodem (ATW1&C1&D2S95=44&W0) and getting this problem.
(They have refused to help me beyond this, claiming ""it must be
the BBS"" or something like that.  Not so -- my work modem connects
to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a Microcom.)

Anyone have any ideas?!

Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you are 
considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nice 
size external cache!  The performance is far greater.

The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DX 
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neither 
systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM is 
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).

as someone else already mentioned, don't ""carry thru"" the other 23 pins.

plan A, minimal null modem:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
if you're transfering files betwen 2 PCs, this ought to work (unless
you have a persnickity comm program).

plan B, null modem with modem control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
some comm software will wait for DCD before transferring anything.
such software will raise DTR to enable the modem to accept a call.
with this cable, each side's DTR will drive the other's DCD.

plan C, null modem with hardware flow control:
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.

plan D, deluxe null modem (combine B and C):
	SG(7)   -  SG(7)
	TD(2)   -  RD(3)
	RD(3)   -  TD(2)
	RTS(4)  -  CTS(5)
	CTS(5)  -  RTS(4)
	DCD(8)  -  DTR(20)
	DTR(20) -  DCD(8)
this one is ideal.  it leaves out DSR and RI (rarely used anymore).
if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend,
you might add:
	FG(1)   -  FG(1)

the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors.
i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy.

  I am unable to get my Gateway 486DX2/66 to run Windows

sure the 2M is really there because I *can* select

in the ATI's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out.
I have Windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, DOS 5.0.  The
drivers were installed by Gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's
a file missing from the hard drive.  It runs 1024x768 just fine.
  I did go into the Desktop window and select 1280x1024.  Sometimes
it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when I hit
OK and re-enter Desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  At no time does
it unghost 1280x1024 in the main Flex window.  Help!

Any one time means IMHO a single byte xfer. If I have four sources of
DMA requests ready, the DMA would service the one after the other. If
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the ISA/DMA
bandwidth, this will work.

Note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the DMA
controller.

I bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the PC running the
menu all night.  There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
PC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called. 

Somebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred
them, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a TSR or system patch or something.  As far as I know the CMOS clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than DOS's clock).

when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
seconds later, the green ONLINE light should come on.

hope this helps.....

and
(b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work,
it also turned out that:
(c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs
thought that was standard practice and
(d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and
my CMS250 tape drive start running away.

I suggest that you go direct to the original (and preferred...best quality)
source for all of this, just as you would (at least, should) for the chips
themselves:  National Semiconductor.  you can reach them at 1-800-272-9959.
they no longer package the data sheets in a book, as they did when I got
mine, but you can get them as individual sets of data sheets.  you want, as
a minimum, the following:

   *) 2 sets of data sheets:
      *) NS16450/INS8250A/NS16C450/INS82C50A
      *) NS16550AF

   *) 2 application notes (yes, GET THESE!):
      *) AN-491 The NS16550A: UART Design and Application Considerations
      *) AN-493 A Comparison of the INS8250, NS16450 and NS16550AF Series
         of UARTs

both of the application notes I listed have proven to be AT LEAST as
valuable as the data sheets themselves (more, actually).  AN-491, in
particular, is an exceptionally well-written application note that goes
into detail about how and why the 16550 does what it does, and how best
to take advantage of it.

btw, they send these out free, as long as you don't abuse it.

I know you work at sun, but that's really no reason not to like fast

computers faster instead of degrading others'. Why don't you go straight for

I have a Gateway 4DX-33V with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive A.  I
accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from ONE particular
box of diskettets in the A drive when I boot up, rather than getting
the ""Non-system diskette"" message, the machine hangs and the CMOS
gets overwritten (luckily, Gateway sends a print of the standard
CMOS settings with their systems).  This only happens with a box
of pre-formatted Fuji disks that I have, no other disks cause this
problem.  If I re-format one of the Fuji disks, the problem goes away.
I did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.

Anyone have any idea what is going on here?  Hardware problem?  A
virus that can't be detected?  The system reading in garbage from

Subject: HELP! Installing second IDE drive
Organization: SURAnet, College Park, MD, USA, NA, Earth, Milky Way
Lines: 44
NNTP-Posting-Host: azathoth.sura.net

Recently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,
I can look up the model number if it's important) and I've been
trying to help him install it.  [I've got a vested interest, since
my machine's busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]
He already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number
but I can find out.)

Anyway, I can't seem to get the bloody thing up.  I've managed to get
one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both
at the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -
never gets past the system test.  The IDE controller's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives; I think I've configured the CMOS
correctly; the power's plugged in properly; I even learned about the
master/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn't
know PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers
properly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).

The only thing I can think of is maybe I'm doing the cabling wrong.  I've
tried several combinations:

controller - master - slave
controller - slave - master
master - controller - slave

None of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.

Another possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for ""C: drive"" and ""D:
drive"" setup info rather than ""drive 1"" and ""drive 2"" like most others
I've seen.  Could this be confusing things?

So, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some
info for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so
it looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!

Many, many thanks in advance!  This is practically an emergency (I have
two papers to do on this thing for Monday!)!  Help!

Your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to/CMOS is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed RAM is installed.  No
motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call
failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use
""slower"" RAM in a machine.  You either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow RAM (in which case, all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower RAM will act like faster RAM and you won't crash.

Putting faster RAM in won't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster RAM.  

Mixing fast and slow RAM will not help you if you have to keep the bus 
slowed down to accomodate slow RAM.

I'm sorry if I'm misunderstanding your post, but DRAM *does not* have to
be refreshed on *each access cycle*.  So cycle time does *not* have to be
twice the access time *because of refresh phase*.

The access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe (RAS) to data bus driven.

DRAM access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some
signals are intentionally omitted);

ADDR --<RA><CA>-------<RA><CA>--------- RA=Raw Address, CA=Column Address
RAS  ~~~~\________/~~~~~\________/~~~~~		~=High, _=Low, -=Floating
CAS  ~~~~~~~\_______/~~~~~~\_______/~~~		<..>=driven either H or L
DATA ---------<VALID>--------<VALID>---
         |-------+------|
         |-+--|  |
           |     +----------- cycle time
           +---- access time (or RAS access time)

Yes, the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but *not*
because of the refresh phase.  The refresh can be done either as a
trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.

2 ) I have it in a machine with a network card, and
    everything works fine until I run windows, when

    (In case it's important, the network card is an
     SMC ArcNet 8-Bit compatable card.  It's I/O
     address is 02E0 and it's RAM base address is
     D000.  It's also using IRQ 2)

    I believe there is a file on the Diamond Bboard that
explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, I don't
know the Bboard number.

    If you can, please help me with as many of the following

Yes only your $00.02.  Here's mine.

If I were running at a new chip at a Trade show, and had little to no real
technical knowledge,  I wouldn't let some stranger with a diskette boot my demo
machine.  If the demo machine is down too long people will not see my nice
demos, and if this purposted LINUX diskette is really something that will wipe
the disk, or is loaded with a VIRUS!, I'm in deep trouble.

No marketer in their right mind would let you do this, unless they had
specifically invited people to do so, and provided machines to do it with.

We can we learn : This technology will be shipping from PC vendors in May 1993,
and will be i486 compatible.

Hello

I have recently suffered from various problems concerning
an Adaptec 1542A controller.

Problem 1:
Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumpers
on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately I
have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would like
to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they 
are located.

Problem 2:
My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)
I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have been
formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
system on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as getting
the MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatible
memory drivers.
Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?

	Thanks in advance

        Jouni

I'm having trouble with installing a second IDE drive on a Promise IDE caching
controller. The first drive is a conner 3204 and works fine. The second drive
is a conner 30174, it is currently unjumpered  to be the slave drive. The
problem is the slave drive is recognized but is reported back as having no
free space. Disabling cache has made no effect. What else should I check for?

Krispy,
Lets start with what Promise controller that you have. Ther are only
about 4 or 6 of them made. The one that I have the DC-99m needs
nothing done but install it as stated. As to the 2th. hd you do know
about running FDISK on it and partisitions and then formatting it
after your finished with the fdisk operation right!....Sam

>The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.

One of the monitors I reviewed for the June issue of Windows Magazine was
the Mitsubishi.  I also reviewed a new Nanao, the F550iW, which has just
been released.  Last year for the May '92 issue of Windows, I reviewed
several monitors, including the Nanao T560i.  There's no question that the
Nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last
year.  The difference between my ranking of the best in Windows and the
ranking in Windows Sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring.  I used different tests than they did, and I
scored differently.  There's nothing wrong with the Mitsubishi, and it
scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.

Incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully.  Unless you know how the product
testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly
know what they really mean.  Just seeing that I rank a monitor differently
from Windows Sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking.  Likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  After all, some of
what we do may not apply to you.  Likewise, some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another.  You can't always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
don't also understand the scoring.

Originator: kruckenb@peruvian.cs.utah.edu

FOR SALE:

AT&T Dataport Internal 14.4K Fax/Modem

The modem is an internal AT/(E)ISA 8-bit card (just a little longer
than a half-card).  It has v.32bis for 14.4Kbps data / 9600 bps fax,
v.42, v.42bis, and MNP5 for error-correction and data compression, so
you can get error-free links up to 57,600 bps on a conventional phone
line.  They will ""fall back"" to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error-correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

It has a 16550 buffered UART for better compatibility with
multi-tasking operating systems (Windows, OS/2, Unix, etc).

They use a patented technology called Optical Line Interface (OLI)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

These modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free, too) from AT&T.

They also include the lovely and talented QuickLink II for DOS and the
NEW QuickLink II for Windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any DOS or Windows
application just by printing.  The Windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics, etc.  The DOS version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (I believe that there are 5 or so,
as well as any HP Laser II resident fonts).

I'm asking $210.00 for this modem (plus Utah tax).  This is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including Zoom, US Robotics, etc).  And, it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

This price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown SLC.  I can also arrange shipping, or you can stop by my home
to pick it up.  (If you're concerned about installing an internal
modem, let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

If you're interested, please let me know.  This is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for ~$500 and retail for
about ~$300).  I installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

If you have questions about this, AT&T has an info number at 
(800) 554-4996, or you can email me and I will attemp to answer them.

The modem will go to the highest bidder I get within the next week.

Thanks.  
Pete

While others here may have had better experiences, I, too, share the
sentiments posted above.  Though I have the original Stealth/VRAM,
it is only ""relatively"" recent that the Windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance.  Note that there are
STILL a couple of modes I cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing,
mis-drawn check boxes, etc.  I believe the version I have is 2.01.
If there's a more recent release, I'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know -- I haven't been able to get on their
BBS lately to check again.  Naturally, Diamond doesn't even bother
notifying me of fixes/releases.

Diamond was helpful when I finally reached the ""right"" person in curing
some of my Windows' problems due to an address conflict.  The conflicting
addresses (2E0, 2E8) were OMITTED in at least my version of the
Diamond/VRAM manual.  I hope it has been corrected by now.  The tech rep
explained that ALL S3-based boards use these addresses.  I have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

When I upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus), I'll seek a video solution from someone other than
Diamond.

I have been using a NEC 3FGx for several months now.  Several others here 
also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33 
MHz viz 50 Mhz.  Based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA 
local bus.  The redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.

I bought a Maxtor 4380 300mb ESDI HDD from Hi-Tech for $300, then paid to

fine!  It low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  AND THEN...
(Jaws Music) sectors start going bad!  EEK!!!  One at a time.  Norton disk
doctor keeps marking some U and some C.  That FIXES it.  For about 5 minutes.

Then next day when I run NDD on it again: NO DICE more uncorrectable and
correctable sectors.  AHHHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!  So I fugure: ""Ok, NDD's
just not being thurough enough, I'll use Spinrite, I heard that works well.""
What happens?  Spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  
AHHHUUUURRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!!!!  NDD undoes it of course.  The problem seams to
be getting worse and worse.  HOWEVER when the HDD is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.

I'm so pissed off right now I'm considering buying another HDD, and I really
can't afford it.

I'm using SMARTDRIVE, and WINDOWS 3.1 (I'm not using the 32 bit disk access
though, I know that can create problems).  The disk is using the second
option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls,
and everything else selected is standard, maybe I need to use a different
head skew or something?  I don't know.

ANYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM PLEASE TELL ME HOW!!!! HELP!!!!

I just bought an actix graphics engine 32 plus with 2 megs.  

I am not impressed...

I have been having all sorts of problems with the board.  Various lock-ups
in windows, problems with the screen not centering, no flexibilty in choosing
synch rates for a monitor, buggy windows drivers, lack of 1024x768x64k driver,

If anyone else has one of these cards, please e-mail me...

Looks like i'm going to try the ati ultra plus...

Hi!

I think VGA-Copy can do what you need. 
If you create a new floppy for your a: drive (that is the 5 1/4""), turn on
the ""modify"" switch of vga-copy.
When you boot using this diskette, a message appears:

This is no system disk, you can
1) replace disk with another,
2) boot from Harddisk or
3) switch drives and reboot (that is, a: becomes b:, b: becomes a:)
Type your choice:

When you select the third item, you can boot from b: which is now called a: .
Seems to work very good, for example booting drdos6 from the installation disks
in 3.5"" format was no problem for a friend of mine (I have only a 3.5"" a: drive)

Hope that helps
Robert

P.S.: VGA-Copy is shareware, so it's easy to get. Newest Version seems to be 5.0 .

Referring to the manual of my motherboard with AMI-BIOS, 10 beeps are a 
'CMOS Shutdown Register Read/Write Error', if the system stops after these
beeps. If the system continues, it is a 'Keyboard error'.

  Hmm your CD-Rom program must be using some oddball VGA modes.

  I think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month, when
it is released though it'll be in limited quantities, I think they
have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out
a bit later).

  Since you have a Viewsonic 17 (I think it has a 78khz horizontal
frequency right?), you're gonna love the 2 megs version.  It can
do 1280x1024x256 at 75Hz, 1152x900x256 at 80Hz, 1024x768x256 at 90Hz(!),
1024x768x65536 at 75Hz.  It can also do 640x480x16 mil. and
800x600x16 bit at 90Hz, too bad I don't have such a high bandwidth 
monitor like yours ;) ;) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor,
otherwise you'll have to use a lower refresh rate)

  If you want more info. about the coming Graphite VL, you should
go to the IBM hardware section on Compuserve (IBMHW), in the
video sig.  There're several Hercules reps there that are very
helpful.

The newer the drive, the less problem you will have. The old ten and fifteen

I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs
RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to 
install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could
select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever
installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested
the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a
parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as
also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). 

Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it
makes the system slow!

Thanks for your help.

I recently bought a monichrome VGA monitor for $99 that will do
1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. However, it is
a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 kHz horizontal, I
think. With my Trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
- not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to
something else, especially if it wants to do text, I suppose. Anyway:

 - is there any way that I can use this as a general-purpose VGA

Contrary to what others might have thought, I actually did have a SCSI drive
once.  It was the Seagate 296N and the ST-02 controller.  I found that the
controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best I could do
with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.

I have had that drive/controller coexist with MFM, RLL, and IDE drives
because the ST-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computer's bios.  Dos will see many logical drives, much more
than 4 (I've had up to 10).  I've often wondered how many SCSI drives you
could hang off a ST-01/02.

Did I once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a 
clock, *has* to make a Get Date system call? Apparently, the clock
hardware interrupt and BIOS don't do this (date advance) automatically. The
Get Date call notices that a ""midnight reset"" flag has been set, and then
then advances the date.

Anybody with more info?

I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
(obviously exaggerated).

Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

Hope this helps.  I had exactly the same problems.  Unfortunately when

You realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
personal politics are more important than [SMCAP][BOLD][Font:God
999pt.]The Law[smcap][bold][font].

But that's irrelevant to the problem here.  Windows came with my
system, but on 5.25"" disks.  I hate using 5.25"" disks, so I copied
them over to high density 3.5""'s using xcopy.  It worked fine.  In
fact, for a while I was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that I decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  Not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
can simply copy them all into one directory.  Makes it a lot nicer
when you're switching printer emulations around.

Norton 6.0 I don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals, and it worked fine.  This would imply that arj a -r norton
c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
the first time, you've got the whole thing.

Never played with WP for Windows; I'm not too big of a fan of anything
from Utah.

Good luck....

Ok I will do this V E R Y  S L O W L Y so you can understand
REGUARDLESS of whether it is a Mac or a PC SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 are DIFFERENT
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous SCSI-1.  All of these
have DIFFERENT SPEEDS and COSTS. Lumping them all together as 'SCSI' is
dumb and sloppy.  Take again the quote later on as an example of the problem

Already GAVE them.  YOU keep deleting them! So here are the Specs
on everybody AGAIN {With some added info}:

SCSI-1 {SCSI-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3MB/s
 synchronous range: 0-5MB/s  Both common to the PC world; difference is
 mainly in software not hardware.

SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip; also called SCSI-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6MB/s with 
10MB/s burst.  This is advertised as SCSI-2 in BYTE 4/93:159 FOR the
 PC and AT THESE SPEEDS.{NOT the Mac, the PC.}

{I have not seen the following for EITHER the Mac or the PC}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
 asynchronous range: 0-5MB/s {infered from BYTE 4/93:159}

Note that I ALSO give the AVERAGE through put for SCSI-2 which holds true

With PC articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is NOT with
SCSI but with the PEOPLE WHO REPORT IT! {Like YOU.}
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote: 
(My comments in {})
""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with
a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE..."" {this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with 
a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2} PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29
The ARTICLE is confused, NOT SCSI.  The TERM is a mess from inconsitant use
NOT because the interface itself is a mess.

SCSI means ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
NOT 'SCSI-1' as some people want to use it.

To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}.  Lumping
everything into SCSI as SCSI-1 is SLOPPY, WRONG, and DUMB.  Inconsitant
SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 usage is also a problem.  Clean it up now or have
a mess like SVGA was several years ago because everybody and his Uncle
slapped 'SCSA' an their own monitor inteface {SCSI IS standarized unlike
SVGA was years ago EXCEPT in terminaology.}

I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.
The summary:

CTX 14"": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.

CTX 15"" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.
  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning
  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.

I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even pay
shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. 

It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron
(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.

Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to
send it back if it's not perfect. It probably won't be when you get it,
but has good potential.

Do these CPU Fans also have heat sinks?  Do you recommend using both
on the same chip (i.e. heat sink sandwiched between CPU and Fan)?

If we are just talking about a CPU Fan blowing directly on the CPU chip,
I can't see how ""heat sink grease"" is necessary (or even desireable).

   You might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one
may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  I say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a PC user wanting to use that monitor, than
an Atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild - converting the monitor to VGA, then
using it as a VGA monitor with a Falcon :-)

   As for graphics cards, assuming that the Atari monitor can be
modified/adapted to handle VGA signals, you should probably be able
to use any VGA card (at least with a res around 640x400).  I haven't
tried this, but that would be my guess...

				Robert Anisko
				anisko@usdtsg.daytonoh.ncr.com


...you might want to price mono VGA monitors anyways - it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the Falcon and
beyond, VGA/SVGA/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...

 A suggestion:  Slave (hook in series) a small pilot light off the fan
circuit.  Then, if the light goes out, you know your fan is not working.

There is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. What is nice is 
being able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of

SCSI makes sense is you are going to load up a machine, if you just want
a standard box for Windows then IDE makes sense.

I have one loaded box that uses SCSI and run Unix and one standard box
that runs DOS/Windows that uses IDE.


[ By standard I mean - 486, 4-8MB RAM, 200MH disk, S3 video ]

I have an internal modem that I configure as COM4 with IRQ 3, but

When I get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows

should be at COM4.

Now, I know the modem is working correctly since I have tested
it in a different PC - and it shows up correctly as COM4, 2E8, IRQ3.

To make it work in the DOS 5.02 PC, I have to configure the
modem as COM3, 2E8, IRQ3---but though I have a comm program that
allows that, the FAX program that came with the modem does not work.
Anyway, I would like the computer to display the modem as it is set,

I did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all:
a few displayed the modem as COM4, and others displayed it as
being COM3.

I am not using Windows, this is just a DOS problem...Any help

For various reasons, I must have this modem work at COM4, thus
switching COM ports is not an answer...

Hi to all you PC gurus!

I'm new to these groups and so please forgive me if my questions are frequently
asked, but I don't know the answer :) I've been recently having some problems
with my 386 computer with a Seagate 40 meg hard drive. I occasionally find
corrupted files, but most of the time programs work fine. Are there any utilities
that are easily available that can help me determine whether or not the problem
is a result of the hard drive vs an ill-behaved program or some other hardware
item? Are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly
aligned etc? As might be expected, I would greatly appreciate any help on this
matter. I'm considering just reformatting the disk and reinstalling everything
(and hoping that will fix the problem), but I would like to have some assurance
of what the problem cause is. 

Also, can someone give me an opinion on DOS 6.0? Are the compression and
defragmentation routines good enough to consider the upgrade if I don't have
those routines already (as opposed to buying them separately)? 


Much thanks in advance for any help.

  Just a note, even though the 805 can address 2 megs of dram, the
Stealth 24 VLB can only handle 1 meg, unless Diamond has a newer

I am wanting to upgrade from a 386SX-25, to a 486DX-33, and are looking at a

Now, I have 4 meg of RAM in my 386, which consists of

4 x 9 module 1024KB simms, running at 70 nanoseconds.

Would I encounter problems with the pointed out areas, by throwing these from

The F550iW is optimized for Windows.  It powers down when the screen
blanker appears, it powers down with you turn your computer off, and it
meets all of the Swedish standards.  It's also protected against  EMI from
adjacent monitors. 

Personally, I think the F550i is more bang for the buck right now.

the Courier is their top-of-the-line product, thus the higher price.  I've
never taken a real look at the Sportster line (only Couriers), but from what
I've gathered, it's basically more of an entry-level modem.  probably
doesn't meet the same specifications that the Courier does.  I'm not sure
if the Sportster line is fully DSP driven like the (more recent) Courier
modems are, so upgrades in the future may be an issue.

again, take all of the above with a grain of salt...I've never evaluated
the Sportster, so I'm going by bits and pieces that I've heard.  if you
want a real answer, post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you'll find
people who HAVE worked with the Sportster.

personally, though, if I were going to look at the Courier modems, I'd
buy the Dual Standard...then I'd get both HST and V.32bis.  in fact, this
is exactly what I did.  :-)  I'm sitting here looking at my USR DS right
now.

and now, to correct a few VERY incorrect statements....  folks, if you want
to get reliable answers to modem and/or UART questions, post them to
comp.dcom.modems.  if you post in other groups, you never know what you'll
get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you
may get something like the one below).  at least in cdm, if someone posts
complete and utter bs, you'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to
avoid spreading faulty info).

>The Sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.

just as it does at lower speeds, too.  there is absolutely nothing in
either CCITT Recommendation V.42 or V.42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running V.32bis.  V.42bis, of course, is
currently only *STANDARDIZED* for operation on top of V.42 (in its primary
mode of operation, LAPM), but that's about as far as that goes.

and just in case there's some confusion on this, V.42/V.42bis are also
supported by the Courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).

>The difference
>with the Courier, is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the HST mode. 

take a second look at the original question:

>In a previous article, cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (Holly       KS) says:
>>What is the difference between the US Robotics Courier v32bis external
                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
see the V.32bis up there?  the question was not about the Courier HST
modem, or about the Courier Dual Standard...it was about the Courier
V.32bis modem.  the modem in question does not support HST, period.  it
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb HST.

also, not all Courier HST / Courier Dual Standard modems support the 16.8 kb
version of HST.  my Dual Standard only supports HST at 14.4 kb.  there are
even older models that only run HST at 9.6 kb.

>This is a proprietary mode of USR and it will only connect to another of
>the same type unit to achieve this speed.

HST is USR's proprietary modulation scheme....  but we're not talking about
HST, we're talking about V.32bis.  V.32bis is most definitely *NOT* a
proprietary modulation scheme.

>The Sportster will do
>asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous.  The HST is one way
>only.

I do hope you didn't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way.....

first off, V.32 and V.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous.  this is
part of the CCITT Recommendation (i.e., part of the standard).  it isn't a
feature unique to the Sportster (I just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the Courier DS manual).

second, HST is not ``one way only.''  more correctly put, it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme, meaning it doesn't work at the same speed
in both directions.  HST operates at [9.6 / 14.4 / 16.8] in one direction,
and has a low-speed back-channel in the other direction.  the high-speed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow.  this is fine if
you're logged on to say, a BBS, and type one letter and get screens of
info back, transfer files (not using bimodem), etc....  there is, of course,
a penalty for turnaround time when the high-speed channel needs to reverse
directions.

V.32 and V.32bis are both symmetrical, meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time.

third, synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.

>The HST's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.

again, more correctly put, *SOME* of the Courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever ``V.fast'' is called when it's complete.  if you have the large
footprint Courier modems (like I do), you're S.O.L.....  there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety, which
could eventually be upgraded to support V.fast, but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.

later.....

There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any ""built-in"" drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.

Good Luck

Yep.  I've done this, too.  The trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
down on the ""latch"" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  Label
each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
them out.  Compare the pinout tables in the Mitsumi and Soundblaster manuals
to get the correct orientation.

Subject: Orchid P9000 vs Fahrenheit (mini review)
Organization: Adobe Systems Incorporated
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 79


I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with
everything about Zeos.  That computer went off to grad school with my son and
I replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,
128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a
17"" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast,
quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems 
busier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, and
they called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's a
slight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they 
have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,
customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to
talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.

Hai,

In a few days I'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
It comes with a Cirrus Logic VLB card which has 2Mb RAM onboard.
It can do true-color but I don't know what type of card it is.
I read that Cirrus Logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.

My old system had a TSENG 4000. I was pretty pleased with it, so I
consider buying a W32/TSENG card. I'd like to know a few things:

	- How is the speed/performance in DOS/Windows/Unix/OS/2
	  Graphics & Text (also compared to S3 cards for example)
	- What resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
	  support (text & graphics)
	- How many RAM can be installed and what type of RAM
	- Compatibility with old TSENG 4000
	- Support in software

If anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) I'd like
to know. If you have a better alternative than the W32 please tell
me about it.


For the people in Holland:

Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
3 minutes to warm up.  

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the 
CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait 
for about 3min before the display shows anything and
it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).
If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again, the display works as normal like before.

Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for
years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.

I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.
Thanks a lot.

I recently bought an AMD 386/40.  The motherboard booklet says
the board is a ""391 WB/H.""  I have 4 1x3 simms on board.  The machine
also uses a Super IDE I/O Card (model PT-604). (of course niether
the motherboard or the I/O card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
are) I'm also using a Trident 8900C SVGA card.

	Anyway, that's all of the pertinent info I can think of.
My problem is that the computer often freezes or displays ""Parity Error --
System Halted"" messages depending on whether I set the Memory Parity Error
Checking to ""disabled"" or ""enabled"" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).
Its AMI bios (so it must be an AMI board?).

	I just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
SIMMS but I keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  It all
worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till I got home (figures).

	I've tried to take out all of the SIMMS and even re-inserted them
in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.

Interesting.  Would you care to explain to me then, how my SoundBlaster

Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).
It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.

Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with
16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so
it could co-exist with my existing card.

Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?

LPT ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  Try this: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings.  Try

C>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1

to set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT1 like this:

C>MODE LPT1=COM1

This should work.  Good luck!

There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
more CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.
With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while disk
operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
an *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.

So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

One way is with DMA or bus mastering.  Either of these make it
possible for I/O devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the CPU.  The alternative is for the CPU to move
the data.  There are several SCSI interface cards that allow DMA and
bus mastering.  IDE, however, is defined by the standard AT interface
created for the IBM PC AT, which requires the CPU to move all the data
bytes, with no DMA.

Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so

sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn

of their answers are correct, but those salesmen don't even realize how stupid
they are.   ...  .......  O.K.  ...I'll settle down now....  .... let me

Fact: retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.

Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine;
for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers,
microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an
idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my
computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll

>How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

By initiating a DMA xfer.  :)

Seriously, busmastering adapter have their own DMA ability, they don't use
the motherboards on-board DMA(which is *MUCH* slower).

ISA has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 ISA system
try to do DMA xfers on the same DMA channel the system will lock or 
crash.(I forget)

Their are 8 DMA channels in an ISA system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
16-bit.

The system uses DMA 0, a SoundBlaster uses DMA 1.

I could buy a busmastering XGA-2 video card & a busmastering SCSI HA.

In order for them to work properly, I would have to find out what DMA
channel the XGA-2 card uses and then simply configure the SCSI HA to
use a different DMA channel for its DMA xfers.

I don't know if multiple DMA xfers can go on at the same time on ISA.
I'm not sure if they can on EISA systems either.

I do know that on EISA/MCA systems, you can allow BM cards to use the
same DMA channel.

Thanks.

Anyone have experiences, good or bad, with replacing the MFM controller
and drive with an IDE controller and drive in a Zenith 386/16? I had
heard some rumors about bus mastering problems on some CPU board 
revisions.

I finally got the vesa driver for my ATI graphics ultra plus (2M).  However,
when I tried to use this to view under 24bit mode, I get lines on the picture.
With 16bit or below, the picture is fine.  Can someone tell me what was wrong?
Is it the card, or is it the software?

Not so! I have both IDE and an Adaptec1542B in the same box and can use both

Does anybody have an opinion on the Philips 1762DT 17"" monitor?  How does it
compare to the Nanao 17""?  I am looking for a good 17"" (like many other
net'ers) and found a good price for the Philips.  Here some the specs:

	Sony Trinitron tube
	digital micro control
	1280x1024 NI
	.25 dp
	300x225 mm display area
	to 100 Hz refresh
	anti-glare, MPR-II...
	auto-scan 30-64 kHz

Why don't I ever see this monitor for sale (ONE company in Apr computer shopper)
What is the 1764DC?  What is the best price around for this?....

and how 'bout that MAG 17""?  I love my MAG 15"" (except for that little color

I'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  My machine has 4 serial ports.  Com 1 and3
and 2 &4 share same IRQs.  You mean I can't plug a mouse into Com1 and a modem
into com3 and expect both to work?

If Answer is NO, should I change IRQ's for com ports to be different?  And,
does it really matter which IRQ I set the ports too?

Maybe you need to go into \mach32\install and set a refresh rate for

[Tons of stuff deleted on SCSI vs. IDE question...]

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).  How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?
Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments on these rephrased questions.

Randy

This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to
get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!
I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns
one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,
as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.
My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).

If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of
everything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(

   A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it 
best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible, 
however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available 
on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
of the ""normal"" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you 
wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).
Good luck,

- Pete

We had the same problem in our company. We changed the keyboard-bios and
after that, everything went fine. Our dealer told us that some boards of

Subject: Floppy problems

I have a floppy drive which has developed ""General failure"" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5"" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

Thanks!

Cheers, Ben

	Hello.  My colleague has a Samtron monitor.  On the manual

It depends on what you'd like your joystick for.  I've seen Gravis
joysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my
hand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

I recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. 
I'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works
quite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or
down in features.

For price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here
compared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra
$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

Just another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle
Wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,
down, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a Gravis gamepad.  They look like a Nintendo control pad but I don't know
much beyond that.

The fan in my power supply, like most, is distractingly LOUD. Has anyone found 
a solution to running a pc with peace and quiet? Short of buying a notebook 
PC, I don't know what to do. Oh yeah, I did hear about a power supply called a 
""Silencer"" - which is supposed to be more quiet. Has anyone had experience with
this? I was quoted a price of $225 (!) for a 270Watt Silencer.

I've even considered stuffing my PC case in one of those acoustic ""printer 
enclosures"", but that wouldn't be the most elegant solution. Also, I'm 
guessing that would also cut the ventilation.

Any other ideas?

Thanks in advance for ANY suggestions! Please E-mail whatever you post...

The problem is with ISA bus-masters which
can only address the first 16MBs of system
memory.  Bus-masters do not use the CPU
nor the system DMA to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system RAM.

Subject: New Windows drivers for Cirrus GD5426 graphic cards
Nntp-Posting-Host: brahms.udel.edu
Organization: University of Delaware
Lines: 43


I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install 
COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which 
write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call 
fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put 
""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS 
tables are updated. It works great. PF will also let you swap ports and 
such also if that is of any value to you.

Connecting devices
------------------
 
  Normally, a 7 wire connection is used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
	DTR1    to    DSR2
	DSR1    to    DTR2
	RTS1    to    CTS2
	CTS1    to    RTS2
  If a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
        RI, DCD
  If software wants it, connect DCD1 to CTS1 and DCD2 to CTS2.
  BEWARE! While PCs use pin 2 for RxD and pin 3 for TxD, modems normally
have those pins reversed! This allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
to pin 2 etc. If you connect two PCs, cross RxD and TxD.
 
  If hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
can be used. Connect:
        GND1    to    GND2
	RxD1    to    TxD2
	TxD1    to    RxD2
Additionally, connect (if software needs it):
        RTS1    to    CTS1 & DCD1
	RTS2    to    CTS2 & DCD2
	DTR1    to    DSR1
	DTR2    to    DSR2
You won't need long wires for these!
  The null-modem connection is used to establish an XON/XOFF-transmission
between two PCs (see software section for details).
  Remember: the names DTR, DSR, CTS & RTS refer to the lines as seen from
the PC. This means that for your data set DTR & RTS are incoming signals
and DSR & CTS are outputs!

I have got an Adaptec SCSI card, that comes with its own version of FDISK.
The problem with DOS is that it will only see two hard disks, any more need to be
done by device drivers.

Completed the first theoric part, we have to make the effective
realization of this vehicle.

We need the necessary hardware for image acquisition from a videocamera
and for their subsequent elaboration (tipically: edge detection).

We ask for informations about available products in the market for
this purpose (in real time, 20-25 frames/second).
Hence we need frame-grabber cards and/or DSP cards for SUN or PC platform. 

We are also very interested in receiving comments and suggestions from users
of these cards, especially about programming tools.

Furthermore we are looking for the same kind of informations about
digital controlled Pan&Tilt devices.

Thanks in advance

Hi, I need some advice from the netland in selecting a sound card.

I am about to buy a sound card for my kid. I don't know which one to buy.
Which one to select from the following list:

- Sound Blaster 16
- Miscrosoft- sound card
- Audio Spectrum
- Sound Blaster pro
- Sound Blaster


My allocated budget is around $250.


Could some of you know about sound cards help me to select the most appropriate
one for my kid ?


I have 486-33 Mz OPTI MB.
I also have NEC CDROM that I would like to connect to the sound card.


Thank you.

There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much
expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it
from someone else.

However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.
This is because the MPU used ""speed buffering"" instead of having a
16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the ""speed buffering""
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

Hope this helps...
Tom

Give the new Viewsonic 17 a good look.  I have seen it side by side with
an old Viewsonic 7, a MAG 17, a Nanao 17"" (not the Trinitron one), and
a Sony OEM 17"" (which does have a Trinitron tube).  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and I think it is

     No, it's not true.  You can get SCSI and IDE to work together, but
there are restrictions (at least with the Adaptec 1542):

* You MUST boot from the IDE drive.  There is no way to boot from the
  SCSI drive if you have both IDE and SCSI drives.

* You MUST disable the SCSI ROM BIOS (I'm not sure about this, though),
  and so you must also use some special drivers to access the SCSI
  drive.  (Hmm.  I know that you have to disable something related to
  the SCSI BIOS, but I'm not sure if it is the ROM itself.)

     Back in February, someone asked about IDE and SCSI (this question
gets asked again and again).  At the end of this message, I've included
an edited copy of my reply.  You might find it interesting.

     For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllers
generally have comparable throughput.  You might get slightly higher
throughput with a SCSI disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk
($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  You'll also pay much, much more for a
good SCSI controller.

     Note that good SCSI controllers really show their power if they're
used with a good multitasking operating system (like a PC Unix).
Unfortunately, neither MSDOS nor Windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
operating system.  The performance advantage of SCSI controllers is
mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the SCSI bus as the only advantage.
However, note that you can expect to pay a premium for SCSI devices.

     If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.  It's
cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.

[ Note: the following is true for MSDOS/Windows only.  Who knows what
  the future holds for Windows NT and Unix??? ]

     No.  Generally, you have to find drivers for each SCSI device,
which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the ""better""/""high
performance"" SCSI controllers.  These are typically bus-mastering SCSI
controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
name-brand SCSI devices either come with the card, or can be purchased
(for under $100 list price).  Examples of such driver kits are:

* Adaptec's EZ SCSI kit (list: $75).  This works only with Adaptec SCSI
  controllers.

* CorelSCSI! (from the same people who make CorelDRAW!) (list: $99 (?)).
  This driver kit will supposedly work with any SCSI controller card
  that has an ASPI driver, like the Adaptec.

     Central Point's PC Tools for DOS 8.0 supports a number of SCSI tape
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  Unfortunately, it
works only with Adaptec controllers.

     Yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a
high-performance, bus-mastering SCSI controller.  This doesn't sound
right, doesn't it?  It's true, though.  With one of these controllers,
you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the CMS Jumbo 250), and
Windows 3.1.  I know.  I've been to h*ll and back getting my SCSI
controller to work with various hardware/software (thank God for tape
backups).  If you want a copy of my ""Adaptec 1542 hints and tips"" file,
send email.

     These problems aren't really the fault of the SCSI controller card;
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the PC (e.g., no standards).  However, adding a bus-mastering SCSI card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.

     SCSI holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of PC
compatibility problems.  If you're planning on using only MSDOS/Windows
3.1, stick with IDE.  If you want to use Windows NT or a PC Unix, you'll
have to make some hard decisions: a good SCSI controller and more than
one SCSI hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the
possible cost of MSDOS compatibility.  [ I say, ""probably"", because,
while I know this to be true with a PC Unix, I don't know if this really
will be true of Windows NT.  I suspect that it will, but I don't know
for sure.  ]

OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...

already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

As far as I know, there is no way to get around the BIOS password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the CMOS memory, thereby erasing it. This 
will remove the password, but it will also destroy all the previous BIOS 
settings, so then you'll have to go and set them all up again. On my 386, 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. You just short this jumper briefly, and it interrupts 
power to the CMOS long enough to erase it. I would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

In the future, I would suggest that YOU set the password, and leave it on 
""Setup"" only. That way, no-one else can go and reset it or set it to ""
Always"" unless they know what password you used. They had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386's, for just the same reason.

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is
probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum.  Check those jumpers.

I posted almost the same bad experience with  Midwest Micro but our
%^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. In
addition to the facts that:
(a) the modems (I had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented
and
(b) the tech person had NO CLUE as to how it should work,
it also turned out that:
(c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly USED but the techs
thought that was standard practice and
(d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and
my CMS250 tape drive start running away.

That they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff
as new and won't even apologize for it is another. Stay away from
these crooks!

Bob,
I have walked into Micro Center here in the Cleveland area and bought
a new track ball and picked the only one that was sealed in plastic
rap. Only to get it home and oped it up to find a good year old USED
dirty old track ball with a warranty card for some software package.

I would never even think of installing anything that looked like
it was used at all. You should of called Medwest Micro
and made them do a PUS PULL TAG on it. They would of picked it up
and sent you out a ner one the same day. 
Things get better in knowing how to but equipment after the FIRST try!

I just bought a new IDE hard drive for my system to go with the one
I already had.  My problem is this.  My system only had a IDE cable
for one drive, so I had to buy cable with two drive connectors
on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  The problem is, 
the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the IDE card.  But
for the life of me I cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these.  
Secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
I figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives.  Does it matter which I plug into the ""master"" drive
and which into the ""Slave""?  any help appreciated.  thanks...

1. Dont rely on benchmarks. They often show incorrect due to different
   TSR programs.

2. SCSI often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

3. Make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.

4. You can disable disconnect and get some kB/s but just to loose the mouse
   or other int`s when diskaccesing.

(I get 2.3MB/s with DX50 LB and SCSI LB and Maxtor LXT340SY - Coretest)
(I get 1.3MB/s                                              - Sysinfo)

A friend of mine got a Mag of the above model and it had some distrotion, so
he sent it back.  Unfortunately, the replacement also was distorted.  I would
bet it's a common problem.  The best advice I've heard when buying monnitors
is to actually look at the specific one you will buy (as opposed to model)
since monitor manufacturing even from ""Big Names"" still tends to produce
alot of monitors with visible defects.

You are making the same mistake I did: you are confusing the DRIVE
interface to the DATA THROUGHPUT interface.  Again from my Mac & IBM info
sheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the
info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:
Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed some 
 specifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controller 
 specifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires a
 SCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2
 which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since it 
 needs a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to be 
 very expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst 
 {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst
 {32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
 reduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference between
 SCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.

IBM
HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:
[...]
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.

So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGES 
the through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 mode
it blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.
The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOT
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
SCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fulliling
prophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, which
in turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce its
cost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of the
Rule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}

SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE while
IDE itself limits the through put.

I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway
386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI
controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS
setup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as ""Not installed,""
and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if
this is a problem.  Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin
install his second IDE drive, we had to define a master/slave
relationship for them; do I need to do something similar here?

>I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.

Same here.

Any help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive
ASAP; I'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before I start.

No.  The Always IN-2000, among others requires no drivers for up to 7 SCSI

Rob,
Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use, mine did...
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what
you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if
you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while!

Wondering if somebody could tell me if we can change the cluster size of
my IDE drive.  Normally I can do it with Norton's Calibrat on MFM/RLL drives
but dunno if I can on IDE too.

Hi,

I just disassembled my old XT and get 2 disk drives - 30M hard drive and a 
360K floppy drive.  My questions are:

 -can I use these 2 drives as drives D & E on my 386SX25 ?  This 386SX25
  currently has 80M hard drive, 1.2M & 1.44M floppy drives.

 -if I can, what s/w or h/w do I need ?

 Please send your advice/comments to aovai@qube.ocunix.on.ca

 Thanks a lot,

Some motherboards support VL bus and 50-DX CPU.  There is an option
(BIOS I think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
CPU/VL bus transactions.  This slows the CPU down to a rate that gives
the VL bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  These particular wait(s)
are applied when the CPU transacts with VL bus device(s).  You want to
enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-DX with VL bus devices.

This is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-
tations.  Your mileage may vary.

Strictly speaking, VL and 50mhz are not compatable.  And, there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.

I think the original respondent (Guy Dawson?) was refering to something
much more elementary.

Every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two FATs and
an initial directory.

If you have a small disk (50 meg or less), I would recommend that it remain
a single partition. Unless you have some other consideration.

If you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can
make sense.

> 1) What is a 16550 UART?

I don't know the exact meaning of UART, but I think it is something like
Universal Arithmetic Receiver Transmitter. Normally, the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 UART on board. Those chips generate an IRQ for every char
they received. The 16550 UART has an internal 16 byte buffer, so - with the
right software installed - it generates an IRQ every 16 chars.

If you ran dos, you don't need a 16550, because dos runs only ONE task at a
time and the whole cpu-power could be used for the transfer. But if you are
running a multitasking OS such as OS/2, Unix, etc. ( windows ? :-) ), the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task. 

The result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.

> 4) Is it only for internal modems?

NO. The only diffrence is that internal modems have the UART on board,
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the UART on board.

I use a Zyxel1496B with a 16550UART under COHERENT 4.0. I'm very satisfied
with it but I think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

SCSI-I ranges from 0-5MB/s.

The only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
and monitor.  The floppies are 360k, and the monitor is CGA, but you will need
an adaptor cable to use it.  The junior does not use standard cards.  Unless

One query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something MHz
- thats not the problem. The problem is the speed when turbo is off. Its
7 MHz. The equivalent in car terms is having a nice Porsche with a button
that turns it into a skateboard.

Does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of
turbo vs non-turbo?? I would like to set it to give a landmark speed of

I've done some ASIC and digital design, but not any CPU design.
It would seem to me that on a 486, the FPU is not being used, most of
the cache is not being accessed, the off chip buffers/drivers are idle,
the multiplier isn't multiplying, the barrel shifters aren't shifting,
microcode isn't microcoding, etc.  This means transistors aren't
switching which means less power dissipated (in CMOS), which means
less heat.\

From what I understand, the Pentium shuts down those sections of the
CPU which aren't being used in order to cut down on heat/power.

I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).
I believe I'm getting something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according
to NU).

How would this number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for
my ISA PC, and the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the best system I could
hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

Thanks for any comments.

MINE has a 16450 sodered right on the card.  Why would you need the 16550
anyway?  From what I've heard, when you're multitasking, its FIFO buffer keeps
you from loosing data.  Is this right?

I got a ET4000/W32 card which is made by Cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. The card is a VL-BUS card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1MB DRAM.

It comes with ET4000/W32 window drivers and a normal Et4000 drivers.
The ET4000/W32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
Also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32K and 64K colours.

Here is my winmark result running on a 16MB 486DX33 EISA/VL-BUS system using
Hint chipsets.

Winmark 3.11 from ZD lab.

Using ET4000/W32 drivers
640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.

800x600  16colours 4.01     
1kx786   16        4.22

From the result, the ET4000/W32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the Et4000/W32 chip whereas the ET4000 drivers are
just normal driver for ET4000 based graphics card.

The price of this graphics card that I got is $185 from a local dealer.
It may be less from mail order. It has OS/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

From these results, it has double the performance of a Et4000AX based card
in 256 colours mode.

Yeah.  Sounds typical.  Windows makes all sorts of extra demands on hardware,
and therefore your machine can't keep up with things.  Ever notice how when
acessing the floppies in Windows, everything else slows to a crawl?  I 
imagine your backup and evertyhing else that is running fights for CPU time,
and sometimes the backup program loses.  Be glad.  I can't even run in 
medium speed with CP backup on my machine, supposedly because I have a SCSI
machine which places extra demands on the data bus.

I have been following this thread and figured I'd throw in my two cents...

The Amiga Zorro II bus is comparable with the ISA bus (7.16 vs 8.33 MHZ).
The Amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  OS since '85 and can
operate with 1 MB RAM!  SCSI is used almost exclusively on these systems.

A SCSI controller that transfers data by DMA allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.  A controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices.  This is espically true with SCSI tape
units.  For example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus.  This greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  Which happens to be
what I am doing while reading this group.

Its a long story, but I still use IDE on my 486 except for the CDROM which,
thanks to SCSI, I can move between both machines.  If, and when, SCSI is
better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, I plan to
completely get rid of IDE.

I read about the development of EISA-2 some time ago but dismissed it
in light of the intense interest in VESA and PCI.  However, I recently
was disheartened to hear that ISA cannot address more than 16mb of RAM,
a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon.

I recall that EISA-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements.
Is there such a standard being developed?

The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1
beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer.
If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and
REM out the Adaptec drivers.

Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the
right order.. it will work.

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you
are off to more REM statements and more fun. 

The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be
able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

Hope this helps..

   Even if you are running DOS, if your CPU can't handle the speed of the
interrupts, you will still lose characters.  I have one 286/10 machine with
an external 9600 bps modem attached and can't drive the serial port any faster

Yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 BNC's on it, and is expecting
to get a composite sync signal on the ""green""?  There ought to be a
little black box that takes the VGA signalling (which has horiz, vert,
and composite sync on different pins, plus the R, G, and B pairs) and
merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  It's all
1V analog, as far as I know.  I can build this with op-amps but I don't
think I can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.

Does anyone know of a VGA->RGB(composite sync on green) converter?

I did this.  I use a relay (Radio Shack 4PDT) instead of a huge

It works fine, but you may still need to change the CMOS before the

It's an interesting idea, but the worst-case data patterns developed to
test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect
common faults in memory chips.

	I have a 5FG and think it is great. I haven't seen the Nanao's so I
can't compare, but the 5FG image is very sharp and the color contrast is
*extremely* good. I've used other Trinitron monitors (e.g. a Sun SS2 color
monitors, which is a 19"" Trinitron), and think the 5FG is at least as good,
perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.
	BTW, I could be wrong, but I thought that the 5FGe is slower as well
as missing ACCUCOLOR. It may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5FG
can.

Ok once again with the SCSI spec list:
SCSI-1 {with a SCSI-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5MB/s
 asynchronous range is slower at 0-3MB/s.
SCSI-1 {With a SCSI-2 controller chip}: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}
 Note the INCREASE in SPEED, the Mac Quadra uses this version of SCSI-1
 so it DOES exist. Some PCs use this set up too.

SCSI-2 {8-bit/SCSI-1 mode}:          4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst
{for those who want SCSI-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
 hardware or mess with the SCSI-2 software controllers.  Usable by SCSI-1
 devices with close to 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds}
SCSI-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst
SCSI-2 {32-bit/wide AND fast}:     15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst

On the other interfaces let DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
>IDE ranges from 0-8.3MB/s.                          
Again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
 {Range 0-5MB/s}
>ESDI is always 1.25MB/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

One problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'SCSI' in articles and by
people.  Its PROPER meaning is ""The set of SCSI interfaces composed of
SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2""
Look at the inconsitant use of SCSI in the below quote:
(My comments in {})

PC Magazine April 27, 1993:29 ""Although SCSI is twice as fast as ESDI,
{This is asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip} 20% faster than IDE...""
{this is BOTH asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip AND 8-bit SCSI-2}
To read CONSITANTLY the quote SHOULD read:
{asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-1 chip}
""Although asynchronous SCSI-1 is twice as fast as ESDI, one third the 
speed of IDE...""
or {asynchronous SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip or 8-bit SCSI-2}
""Although SCSI-1 with a SCSI-2 chip and 8-bit SCSI-2 are eight times as fast as
ESDI, 20% faster than IDE...""

NOTE the NONUSE of 'SCSI' by itself.  This eliminates ambaguity.

SCSI-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 drivers 
are VERY expansive {8-bit SCSI-2 can use SCSI-1 drivers with little speed
degridation(the Mac Quadra does EXACTLY this.)}

If we are to continue this thread STATE CLEARLY WHICH SCSI you are talking 
about SCSI-1 or SCSI-2 or SCSI over all {SCSI-1 AND SCSI-2}
IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

If you are talking about laser jet 4 then I believe it has to be postscript.
I don't see any advantage to using PCL when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the LJ4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job.  Besides I don't think PCL is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications.  I only have experience with the Laser
Master Winjet 1200 which brings the LJ4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
It also has a fast print mode which is not postscript, and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi I think), but it is FAST!!!!  This particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript, so even with a decent
PC you know it's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high-end workstation
processed PS.

The quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the PS processing) - I'm rather impatient.

We were using it for B&W camera images (RS-170).  The gray scale image was
accepted by MS Word and handed to the Winjet PS printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the Winjets postscript
processor.  The postscript is rendered into RAM (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer.  The PS processor can also
accept PS files created from other sources including DOS applications, but
Windows has to be running at the time of printing.  The PS processor is
responsible for the halftoning and I'd say it does a pretty good job.  Our
camera images came out very good in my opinion.  (not as good as Laser Master's
demo though).

I don't know how many other similar products are out there but I would be
surprised if there are several.

I also use IRQ 5.  But there is one disadvantage.  Some games assume that
the board is using IRQ 7 and have no way to adjust this setting.  I had

Hello,
    I'm trying to use the BIOS timer interrupts (which occur every .055
seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a
psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01
seconds. Is there any way I can get better precision than by counting
ticks? Or can I make the ticks occur more frequently? I'm trying to do
this in DOS 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work
on our old 8086 machines running DOS 2.1 (I know, I know, I don't like
them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a
possibility. 
    So, basically, any information on the BIOS tick scheme and the

alternate ways of improving accuracy. Email is preferred, as I'm
planning on posting this to a few boards, and I don't read all of them.

Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio)
Organization: Consultant's Connection
Distribution: na
Lines: 54

Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want
to trade elsewhere.

Despite the fact that they answer the phone, ""Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're
having a GREAT Day!"", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.

The details:

I ordered one of their house brand ""Infotel"" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.

It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.

For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.

Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested
disabling the COM2 port.

This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.

I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail 
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I 
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they 
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.

I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA
number. She promptly switched me to a ""Tech Support"" rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.

Conclusion:

I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.

For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know 
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have
known better...

I have a Maxtor 212MB on an ISA IDE controller, although my machine is

the variations of the ISA bus speed. I tested it with speed between

My advice: Buy 4Megs of RAM, save $70 and enjoy performance.

Why the spec list again?  We are talking SCSI on a PC, not on a MAC or

Tell me what the performance figures are with a single SCSI drive on a PC
with an ISA (or EISA or VLB) bus.

Theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate.  I'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megs/sec of SCSI xyz wide'n'fast, but the PC isin't one of
them.

   On a few computers which we have here at Sheridan College there are
files which we would like to make read only.  I have used the Dos attrib command
but some people, who carry around the attrib program in their pockets,
have still been able to erase some of the more important files.  Are
there any software packages which would make an entire drive read-only?
An example, partition the drive into two partitions and have the first
drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second
drive you could both read and write.  
  Any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated.

thanx.

greetings..
I'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
My original IDE HD is a 42MB Western Digital which came with the system
when I bought it. And I just got a 213MB IDE HD Maxtor that I wanted to
add as a slave drive. I did change the jumper settings on 213A Maxtor to
configure it as slave drv, but I didn't change anything on my 42M Western
Dig, since I didn't have any doc. on it. And as I predicted, It just beeped
and gave me an error message about HDD controller.
So, I had to take my 42M off & install my 213A to be my only HD.
 
any help on this matter would be much appreciated.
(before I trashed my 42MB)
 
Thankx much

Every Vote Counts........Feel free to Flood my mail!!!


Rationale
---------
The rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. At the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd-rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. Some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library, government and
network usage, and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing (CDPub has just been setup). In any case a list is not,
and ought not, be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.
 
The reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics,
and between the two main focal points of software, i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. Topics such as CDROM XA, CDI, CD-R, 
Photo CD and other related formats would be included as well. 
Topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books, copyright issues and
other legal matters, packaging, distribution, could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software, as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing, in any format, and is appropriate to the Internet.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software, premastering software, cdrom
simulation software, hypertext, sgml, scanning and imaging
software, data capture software, data clean up, compression,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process - audio and
video.
 
The main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing, as well as hardware for data capture,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware, as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.
 
Notes
-----
These groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
Requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. Questions about cdroms
mounted on LANs should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

IBM, Apple, Motorola Ready to Unwrap PowerPC 601 Processor


The wraps will come off the PowerPC 601 processor this week, as Motorola
Corp., IBM, and Apple Computer Inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. This first in a series of PowerPC processors will be a 32-bit
processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like Intel Corp.'s
Pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. Motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations, running at 50 and 66 MHz with performance of 40 and 50
SPECint89 marks, respectively, sources said. Floating-point performance
for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their SPECfp89
performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. The 601, a scaled-down
version of the Power 220 chip developed by IBM for its RS/6000
workstations, will also include a 32K single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support Motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. The chip, which is being designed initially to support the
Micro Channel Architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
PowerPC- based systems using a number of different architectures,
including ISA, EISA, or Sun Microsystems Inc.'s S-bus design, one source
noted.

According to sources familiar with the development effort, Motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the PowerPC as an inexpensive
architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. Initial chips are expected to
be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than Intel Corp.'s
486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one
source said.

Subject: Adaptec ASW-410 and Sony CDU-641
Organization: Coles Supermarkets

About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with a
CD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation I
had with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used with
CD-ROM drives.  Since then I have learn that this driver is out of date in a
major way and that Adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
(I think it's called EZI-SCSI or something).  I wasn't too fussed about this
until I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I now
find that the audio-mode will not work.  I assume it is not being handled
correctly by the ASW-410 driver.

So, should I chase Adaptec for an upgrade?  If so does anyone know their
FAX number?

Any assistance appreciated.

Regards

BTW: everything else works fine, certainly seems that Sony have caught up with
     the rest with the 641.

Do you happen to know how I can get a serial mouse (9 pins) working on
an IBM L40 notebook (which has a kind of bus mouse connection besides serial
and parallel interfaces). The manual doesn't say anything about it.

I've tried two drivers, with the result that left and right buttons are

wires to/from the mouse?

I have a PC Power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan 
that glues on top of the CPU.  Even if the fan quits you still have the heat

I am planning on upgrading my old XT compatible system with a new
motherboard, hard drive, and 1.4 MB floppy.

I am interested in using my old power supply (150 W) to power the new
hardware, if possible.  

I have been told by the motherboard vendor that I could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.
(Apparently some XT vintage supplies had only 11 wires -- the
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).

My question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an 11 wire supply OR using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery?

I do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if I can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks.

Thank you for any information.  
An email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.

Sorry if this has been beaten to death on this forum.

I am looking seriously at buying a 486 DX / 33 from Gateway.
I will probably buy it without a monitor, as I've heard negative
stuff about Gateway monitors.

I've also heard its tough to get through to technical
support.

I'm seeking opinions on whether or not its wise to go ahead
based on criteria such as price, warranty service, general
ruggedness of the system, reliability of the machine and of
Gateway too, and so on.

Please advise!!

Thanks in advance!

no argument on going direct to National (see my previous post on this topic),
but some info regarding what you said above.  I don't know about the 8250 or

I can also tell you that I'm one of those who won't buy a UART made by

Another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 II
(available via anonymous FTP at many major sites), or FDFORMAT
(also available via anonymous FTP), that allows you to format
5.25HD disks to 1.44Meg, or 3.5""HD disks to 1.2Meg (along with
many MANY other formats!) so you can DISKCOPY (yes, the broken
MeSsy-DOS DISKCOPY!) the 5.25"" disks onto 3.5"" disks or vice

game disks on my old Tandy 1000, and it works...  Another program
named Teledisk (shareware--available on many major BBS's) will
also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 II
or FDFormat installed....  Some disks that won't DISKCOPY
properly can be readily Teledisk'd into the proper format...
At least this is a software solution for a hardware/BIOS 
deficiency, eh?

Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I think
it's great!

However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers
to the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?

Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), and
what I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controller
card on my ISA 486-50.

I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.
And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)
about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm getting
something like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).

How would this
number compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, and
the state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?

Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what would
YOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?

Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if I
were to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?
And how much would it cost?

I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hook
up a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.
Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (and
own the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).  Is this SCSI port a
SCSI-2 port?  How could I tell?  Is the Fujitsu 2623A a SCSI-2?  Are all SCSI
HD's SCSI-2?

Thanks for any comments.

1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it
would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I
don't know what other corrections were made.

2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.

3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from
there.

P.S.:  I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so I uploaded the
file to ftp.cica.indiana too..

There would be no problems as long as the OS didn't set up a DMA transfer
to an area above the 16 mb area (the DMA controller probably can't be
programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)

Besides, like I said before, the FDD controller uses DMA channel #2.
And I don't yet believe that the HDD controllers (any of them, MFM, RLL,
etc) don't also use DMA.

Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5"" drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I'm in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time.

Who said ISA was necessary?  EISA or VLB are the only interfaces worth

You didn't read to carefully.  VLB-IDE uses the same connection mechanism
as standard IDE.  If transfer rate is limited by IDE, whether it's
interfaced to ISA, EISA or VLB matters not.

On mine, for one thing.  SCSI blows IDE out of the water, hands down.  If
IDE has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file
servers?

: What does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec SCSI drive cost?

No, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking OS, SCSI can use both drives
at once.  I've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drives at one time.  It's pretty ugly.

I just bought at Quantum 240 for my mac at home.  I paid $369 for it.  I
haven't seen IDE drives cheaper.

: The original CGA cart back in '84 was $300.  I think the original EGA card

: or SGI or (name your favorite unix workstation).  That is, after millions
: of PC buying decisions over the years, SCSI has had plenty of time to

No, actually, we're talking about SCSI being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the PC.  If they had a common (read:
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a PC (like as in a Sun or
Mac), then you'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice.

: data highway, but I still want to know why it intrinsically better
: (than IDE, on an ISA bus) when it comes to multi-tasking OS's when
: managing data from a single SCSI hard drive.

On a single drive, SCSI is more expensive.  But, you bought your PC for
expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  The
following are why I find SCSI intrinsically better than IDE:

A (partial?) list:
	1.  You can add many different types of devices and access them 
	concurrently.
	2.  A SCSI device works on many different machines (I have a mac
	and a PC at home and moving hard drives between them is VERY nice
	with SCSI -- hook them up and away they go)
	3.  SCSI devices work together better than IDE devices.  For
	instance, recently, I added an older connor 100 meg IDE to a maxtor
	212 meg IDE.  The connor *MUST* be setup as the slave.  It will
	work no other way.  On SCSI, you set the address, check the
	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
	4.  I have a problem with IDE's mutual exclusion - I notice that
	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
	to d: on a SCSI system.  Under a multitasking OS, this is very
	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.

One neat thing that I've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a SCSI system with
little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that I've
added to my PC.  I've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.  

Simply put, SCSI is handier than IDE.  No mysterious jumpers to figure out.

Greg.

You may want to save yourself the trouble and go to Radio Shack.  They have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate.  These are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself, and usually a bit more reliable.

Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5"" hard drive, model
LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.

When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not
the drive.]

My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind
behavior.

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?

Hi all,

  I would like to purchase CD-ROM drive. The specs I would like to have is:

   * Applicable to Kodak multisession Photo-CD
   * SCSI(2) Interface
   * Compatible with Adaptec-1542B
   * Does not need any caddies
   * Cheaper ( < $500 if possible)
   * Double Speeded

  I believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,
  so I would like to know all of your opinion.  The above conditions
  are sorted by my priority.
  I think NEC CDR74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it DOES satisfy
  almost all of the above conditions. The problem is that I do not know
  the compatibility with 1542B. Has someone succeeded to connect these
  NEC drives to 1542B? I have heard a rumor that NEC drive is incompatible
  with 1542B adapter.
  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

What is the difference between IDE HD and SCSI HD?

I asked how much more for the Seagate 500MB SCSI drive.

The guy asked me ""Why are you going with SCSI?"".  I was lost for an answer.
I just said ""I know Seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point

Are SCSI drives faster than IDE?  I'm not buying my GW for another 4 months

A couple of questions that someone may be able to answer - the 21Mb

they need driver software etc. I.e. do you just rip out the floppy
drive, plug the same cables into the floptical, stick in a flopti-disk
and hey presto you have a 21Mb floppy. This sounds far too easy.

PCW article on this subject and there it says that Sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves. From the article it seems that the audio MD format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work - the MD  mechanism is
identical to their MO computer optical drives. A Sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a 2.5"" MD disk would hold about 100Mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized.

The article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. Given that it
probably needs MDs being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by CDs it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get MDs accepted.

Hello

I've got an old Trident 8800CS SVGA card, but lacking suitable drivers
for windows 3.1. The drivers for the 8900 series seem to be incompatible.
Does anyone have an idea of where to get these drivers? Address for an
ftp-site would be nice. 

Thanks in advance

My computer won't recognise my disk after a reboot (Windows crash - Grrr!!)
Are there any options to restore everything, without losing data? 


The drive previously had 3 partitions, but I do not remember the exact
settings.

I have copies of the boot data from the disk (PC-tools rescue disk).  I do not
want to lose my data - 340MB IDE drive.  Do I have any options?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netters!

I need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'Why not ask
the net.community'? I was ordering a Nec CDR-74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that I want to know more.
The drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
to CD's. Perhaps some day I'll want to use it to read the other CD's, but
that's not really relevant at the moment.

I've been offered the following CD-ROM players, for the prices stated.
They all claim to have SCSI-I, and operate under OS/2.
The drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give
your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not
all SCSI. Actually the Nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as
a compatible SCSI product in the os2faq.

I've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. It's actually
about times 1.8.

Mitsumi CRMC     $240
Philips LMS-I    $300
Philips 205      $350
Toshiba ?        $370
Nec CDR-74       $650

Who bought that Trantor that is in the faq? It's extremely cheap and SCSI,
so what's the trick or where can I order it (Holland using MasterCard).

Trantor T128     $200

When a program uses a DOS call to get the system, it resets the flag that
tells the BIOS that it has passed midnight.  It then uses this flag to
increment the date.  If the menu does a call to the system to get the time
before midnight, before the BIOS sees the midnight flag, then BIOS will not
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated.

I might have some DOS's and BIOS's mixed up (darned cold messed up my

  should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution

  in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated
  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller
  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated
  with a normal ide controller?

  3)  is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color

  4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read

This is normally the case, but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator
as you will screw up your warranty if you start to solder the board.

You need a monitor cable that has a VGA connector on one end and five BNC
connectors on the other.  I bought one from Nanao when I bought the Nanao
monitor I use, which also has five BNC connectors.  Check with a computer
store that sells good monitors.  Quite a few companies use that setup.

I have successfully used one on a Toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
""0"" for output, ""1"" for input).

The same code does not work on my desktop machine. I have heard that i might
have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.

For a parallel port i am using one of those IDE SUPER I/O cards and have been
running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.


Any information would be greatly appreasiated.

Hi,
VLB is defined for 3 cards by 33MHz
and 2 cards by 40MHz

there are designs with 50MHz and 2 VLB-Slots.
(s. C't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)

50MHz and 2 Slots are realy difficult to design.

Better OSs (OS/2 & iX) are able to handle more than 16MB of DRAM,
if you use EISA-Bus.
Has someone experience with VLB ??
I think of SCSI-VLB-Busmaster. The problem is the 16bit Floppy DMA
controller, which is unable to reach more than 16MB.

Just a wild thought here, but how about this: there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette, whether or not it contains system files.  It is
this small program that prints the ""Non-System Disk"" error, not DOS.  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is
nonstandard on the Gateway, then it could clear the BIOS.

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten, there is usually a small routine
to clear the CMOS area, in case an invalid configuration prevents the
machine from booting.  I think that the boot code on the Fuji disks may
inadvertantly call this routine.

Just a thought.

You don't have to change the bios config.

It's transparent. It works with any drive. If you change the

Yes, no problem.

That depends. You will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. That's
because access to the card through the ISA bus is slower
than access to system RAM. I don't use smartdrive myself,
but I have a few buffers.

Hi peeps,

Here's another of those ""any ideas"" type queries.

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without
a keyboard.  But no problem so far.

When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.
The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to
CGA - but useful for my laptop).

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?
A UK support dealer said ""Circuit diagrams? Sync?""

So any ideas.

John.

The current Adaptec drivers do not support the Toshiba 3401.  you should
get the Corel SCSI drivers, which do support it.

This is the method that I used, and it works well.

Corel's phone number is 1(613) 728-3733

I have a Headland Technologies Video Seven VRAMII board that only

I need info or help with upgrading this board to 1 Mbyte.  There are

of VRAM.  I would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help
me upgrade this board.  Maybe someone from Headland who maybe read-

Does anyone know of where I could maybe buy the upgrade for this?  I
would sure love to use this in 800X600-256 color mode but for the time
being, I can only get 3/4 of the screen with the bottom part a white

it even works to this degree at all!

As a last resort, I will wind up selling this board :^( and probably be
getting a 1 Mb-ET4000 based ""dumb frame buffer"".  This VRAMII was Editors

I downloaded these files a couple of days ago and they appeared to be
incompatible with this particular card. None of the SVGA drivers worked.
They're probably for the newer 8900 and 9000 series.

I recently bought a Micron 486DX/33 VLB computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  I caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  I was
told I would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed.

I didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but I also don't
know if I could tell the difference.

I tried playing around with settings in the CMOS (bus speed at the like)
and noticed no significant change in performance.

The U-B PCNIC (also OEMed by IBM for a while) is the only Ethernet card I
know of that doesn't use I/O addresses.  It only has interrupts and shared
memory.  The jumpers you see control bits 15-18 in the base address of the
shared memory.  I can't recall which is 1 and which 0, but that's easy

No.  The simple $25 style IDE controller does not use DMA.  The CPU performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction.  This requires that the
CPU stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  Only the smart drive
controllers, be they IDE or SCSI, can transfer via DMA.  These controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are IDE or SCSI.  To get the DMA benefits,
IDE must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.

Floppies aren't on the IDE bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't
an IDE issue.  The floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands.

The difference between IDE and SCSI is that all SCSI peripherials are
intelligent.  They each have their own controller.  They depend on the
CPU to do fewer things for them, i.e. IDE drives needing a processor
to transfer their data.

The dettach/callback mechanism alows the CPU to make requests of the 
devices on the SCSI bus and then dettach and go about its business.
Later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed.  Most SCSI cards will
also DMA the data into memory without the interupting the CPU, therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  IDE supports no such concept
as dettach/callback.  

Can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?

Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!

I recently acquired an AST Hot Shot 286 accellerator board for an 8088
sans documentation.  

Does anyone know what the dip switches on the
back of the card do?  

Did it come with software?

Any help or information about the card would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks,

Okay, I'm trying to install NCSA telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch)

Actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. Fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
controller/cpu know how to use the bus). Since the 286 wasn't cached,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to CPU performance, and
it's possible that DMA bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of CPU cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.

The floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the CPU
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the PC Jr, by the way) really
does stink.

   I am DESPERATELY trying to find a PC based e-mail wide area network service
or the necessary network software to establish one myself. While I am aware
there are various BBS's and other similar services avalible (like Compuserve,
Canada Remote Systems etc.) I require fairly specific criteria. In 
approximate order of importance they are:

1) The mail/files/news are read/written locally and batched to the network
   server. (ie. no continuous on-line connection)(NOTE: all users are remote
   and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)

2) Simple. The users I have for the system have very little computer knowledge
   have never heard of Unix, and have very little interest in learning. It is
   essential that the client software is completely pain-free.

3) Cheap. We would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established
   commercial network, just so we can send large files between members of the
   group - hence (1). In addition I would like the network server to be
   something small, simple and inexpensive like a 486. (There are only about
   40 people in the group, so it is not a huge network.)

4) The capability for Internet access (for news/mail).

5) Internet style id's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)


   If anyone knows of a system similar to what I am describing, even if it
doesn't sastisfy all my criteria, and I don't care where it is, PLEASE PLEASE
e-mail me and tell me about it. We are not adverse to making alterations to
an existing system if necessary.

I am no expert on this.  But I am pretty sure there is no way to recover this.  IDE drive has mapping information written directly on drives.  When you  low level format it, the information itself is gone as well, I don't think you can get it back unless you send it back to Western Digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.

the Atari before I bother.  I am about to start graduate school, and that
means I'm about to be poor!  (There's a price list for used synthesizers on

This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:

  * Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 1.0
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

  * 12"" Atari monochrome monitor

  * Generic 2400 baud external modem

  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.
      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)
      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)
      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)
      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)
      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)
      Migraph's Easy Draw (an early, pre-Postscript release)
      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)


        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.
I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.

are SCSI devices and can read and write both 720 Kb and 1.44/21 Mb

prices really that unaffordable compared to CD-ROMs which are currently

Serial cables:

There are only three output signals: TD, DTR, and RTS.
There are five inputs signals: RD, DSR, DCD, CTS, and RI.

There are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
The IBM BIOS requires asserts DTR and RTS and then waits for both DSR and
CTS before sending.  When a BIOS recieve call is made, it asserts DTR and
waits for DSR to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if DSR never becomes true).  It requires CTS to be true for sending
AND recieving.  Most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol.  The key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

My favorite cable works in many cases: short RTS to CTS at each end, but
also run RTS through to DCD at the opposite end.  TD runs through to RD
and DTR runs through to DSR from both DTE's and of course SG goes through
to SG.

I have never had trouble with this null modem even though I have used it
with a comm. package that was expecting RTS to go to CTS instead of DCD.
The advantage of this cable is that it also works with the IBM BIOS.

According to what others have told me, the ST-296N is difficult to run at
the 1:1 interleave even though Seagate claims it.  I have a non-pc system

How long does he have to take in fixing it?  Does he have to use new
parts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without your
knowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warranty
but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part? 

When it comes to local dealers:

- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their ""techs"" are
re-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.

- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.

- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even done
period, unless you are on a paid service contract.

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a
ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what
I'm talking about. 

I also know the ""local service"" scam that retail computer dealers like
to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers
having been singing for years -- ""Buy from me and you'll get good
service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition
and you'll be sorry if you need service."" 

Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts, 
on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you

X-Posted-From: InterNews 1.0b15@dartmouth.edu
Organization: Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH
Lines: 16

I've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig SCSI-2 3.5"" drives, in
particular, the Fujitsu 2694 and the Micropolis 2112. There is also the
Maxtor LXT1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. They are all quite cheap,
and have nice 3-5 year warranties. 

My questions are: Is there a catch?
                  Which one is better?
                  What type of SCSI-2 do these drives use?
                  Is the service generally better for one of these     
         
                  manufacturers?
                  Are prices likely to go down soon for any reason?

Don't even get hyped up.  They are still accepting submissions from the
members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.

You don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster DSP chips, etc.)
to achieve its performance.

Wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
after that.

 WM> for level II (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 

 Yes.  Mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
 disks at once.  Duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses
 two controller cards and two disk drives.  Duplexing requires a special
 card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).  Duplexing can
 sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives/controllers, as long
 as the sizes are the same.

 WM> So how is the Novell Server 286A normally configured?

 The configuration is completely up to the user.

 WM> 1. Can I install SFT Netware 286 Level II V2.0a as Level I, or is this

 If you only have one disk, then you can't use Level II SFT.  However, the
 OSOBJ disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different
 version of NetWare then you would get a serialization error.  Make sure
 that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
 NetWare installation set.

 WM> 2. Is the Novell Server 286A normally equipped with two hard drives,
 WM> one of which has failed?

 Two drives could be either two netware volumes at SFT I, or one volume
 mirrored using SFT II.  Impossible to tell with the network being down.

 WM> 3. Would this mean I can not install the network software because it
 WM> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?

 Try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and
 installing the software as one volume under SFT I.  If the software will
 install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work
 in this configuration.

 WM> 4. What else can cause a serialization error?

 See the comment concerning the serial number on the OSOBJ installation
 floppy.

 WM> 5. What happens if the keycard fails?

 What is the keycard attached to?

We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.

Another possibility is, that you did not give your email address as password

If you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most

system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (I'm
talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots
uncovered.) HOWEVER, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is RF sheilding. Operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's TV or Ham radio

I was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the option
of adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  The
existing drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,
but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.

The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventually
going to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0

The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991
They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume are
for setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machine
had none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It does
flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, I
would not even know how to do that.

Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a number
for Western Digital might just do as good!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is explicitly NO WARRANTY
that the given settings are correct or harmless. (I only collect, I do
not check for myself!!!). There is always the possibility that the
settings may destroy your hardware!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Since I hope however that only well-minded people undergo the effort of
posting their settings the chance of applicability exists. If you should
agree or disagree with some setting, let me know immediately in order
to update the list.

If you possess a HD not mentioned here of which you know BIOS and/or
jumper settings, please mail them to me for the next update of the list!

Only IDE (AT-Bus) Harddisks will be accounted for.
If not specified the Landing Zone should be set equal to the number of
cylinders. If not specified the 'Write Precompensation' should be set
65535. (There are BIOSes that don't even ask for it).

Another statement (maybe right):
IDE harddisk don't have Precomp and LZone. The precomp is a built-in parameter
and lzone isn't used because most if not every IDE disk has autopark.

The jumpers' names are given as printed on the HD's board, often only a
jumper number (JP12 means the jumper '12'). A zero means that the jumper
is left open, a one means that the jumper is closed.

BIOS SETTINGS

BIOS setting for the M2614ET in my system is 667 cylinders, 33 sectors
and 16 heads.

> I was trying to set my IDE drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
> A Conner 170MB drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer (which works). The factory default on SW2 is On Off Off Off Off Off (1-6). This sets the drive to be a single drive. Setting SW2 to Off On On Off Off Off makes it a slave drive. SW1 has been set to On Off Off On (1-4) all along.

There are 6 switches on the switch block on these drives.  Only 4 of 
them have a use that I am aware of (from my M2624T manual):

Master/Slave        Master (*)      SW1-5 OFF
                    Slave           SW1-5 ON

IO Channel Ready    Disabled (*)    SW1-1 OFF
                    Enabled         SW1-1 ON

I have no idea about the function of SW1-2 and SW1-6.  The values 
listed with a (*) are the factory default settings.

There are two sets of jumpers. A set of 5 and a set of
4. With the power and IDE connector toward you, the set of 5 is
numbered (left to right) J16 - J20  , and the set of 4 is numbered
(bottom to top) J22-J25. 

The only jumper of normal interest is J20. Jumper it for only
drive in a single drive system, or master drive in a dual drive
system.
 
Remove the jumper J20 for slave drive in a dual drive system. 

J19 is a dummy and may be used to store the spare shunt if the 
drive is configured for a slave mode.

Jumpers J17, J18, J24, J25 are factory reserved. Abnormal operation
may occur if jumpered.

Jumper 22 is sync spindle enabled/disabled  (open=disabled)
Jumper 23 is sync slave/master              (open=slave)
Jumper 16 is I/O Channel Ready              (open=disabled)

Link Options

   In order to install the Rodime Ro 3000A series drives the dumpers for 
the single/dual drive and LED operation on the drive need to be set as 
described in the relevant product specification.
   I a single drive environment the drive is described as a Master.
   In a dual drive environment the drives are described as a Master and a
Slave. This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives 
when performing diagnostics.
   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way 
interface connector. They have the following functions and are described 
in order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper 
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

LK2: LED 
     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the
     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An
     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will
     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130
     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.

LK1: Dual Drives
     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,
     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.

LK4: Master
     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If
     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
     jumpered in this way.

LK5: IOChRdy
     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is 
     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per
     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally 
     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per
     second.

   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered:

     Master, single drive with LED on interface		LK2 & LK4 fitted.
     Master, single drive without LED on interface	LK4 only fitted.
     Master, dual drive without LED on interface	LK4 & LK1 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface		No jumpers fitted.
     Master, dual drive with LED on interface		LK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.
     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface		LK2 only fitted.

   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way 
connector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected
by the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the 
drive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further
details.

Please note that these are the *recommended* CMOS parameters. All the disks 
support so-called dynamic translation, and should thus be able to work with
any parameters having fewer sectors than the total number of sectors on
the disk.

Now, according to the manual, the jumper settings are as follows:

Single                                0    0    0

Slave with Conner CP342 or CP3022     1    0    1   


Maybe there are 2 kinds of Caviar's floating around: 

If your jumpers read MA SL and SI then use:
Jumper	SI	MA	SL
Single	1	0	0
Master	0	1	0
Slave	0	0	1

There have been reported difficulties in using WD Caviar as Master and

You unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the Parity Error
Checking enabled or disabled.  I assume you mean it gives you a parity error
when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  How high will the count go on
the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  Does the system beep
at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  The error could be occuring in
Cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.

The fact that you have AMI bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either.  Boards are made by thousands of small Taiwanese companies
(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board.  I tend to doubt your problem is with your
IDE controller, also.

Anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.

Here are the rates I get:

1) sequential read (MSDOS C program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector

   QUANTUM LPS240:   862KB/sec   887KB/sec

2) disk buffer read (same C program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly
                     so in effect is reading the RAM buffer on the drive)

                     8mhz bus    10mhz bus

   MAXTOR LXT340:   1051KB/sec  1224KB/sec
   QUANTUM LPS240:  1026KB/sec  1298KB/sec

I managed to get hold of the QUANTUM LPS240AT product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter,
through the controller, and out the IDE interface.  Nowhere do I see
anything like ""after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host""
(even though I SWEAR that's whats happening ;->).  Here are some relevent
quotes from the manual:

  ""Data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
   3.75 MB/s maximum, 1.87MB/s minimum.""  (My calculations show 3121KB/sec
   maximum and 1578KB/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 RPM with 87
   sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)

  ""Single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
   'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of
   data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance.""  (I take
   this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)

  ""For page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer
   RAM is up to 10.0 MB/s. This high transfer rate allows the AT Interface
   IC to communicate over the AT bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 MB/s,
   while the DCS simultaneously controls disk-to-RAM transfers""
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch WHILE it's sending the
requested sector (it has 3 64KB read buffers for pre-fetching, I guess
you could call that a cache :-|).

So when I do a sequential read on the outer tracks, WHY am I getting a
measly 862KB/sec when I should be getting around 3MB/sec???

Any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?

Hello,

(1. The header (only this) IS a joke, 2. it's worth reading)

Perhaps some of you know my regular 'List of IDE Harddisk specs' where I
give all available information about IDE Harddrives. I am strongly
interested in contacting the manufacturers directly. But I have no money
for overseas calls, so I need

	HARDDISK MANUFACTURER's  EMAIL ADDRESSES

Please help if you can!

    The joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. How?
    You send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
    it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  This time
    is proportional to the joystick position.  Obviously, since time
    is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
    of time.  If you wrote your own routine instead of the BIOS, it
    would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.

In addition to startup time, I leave things running because my PC doubles as 
a fax machine. 

However, this is off the original subject. I didn't get the replies on BIOS, 
CMOS, and DOS clock/date logic. All I know is that I've been running this way 
for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that I have noticed 
the intermittent clock problem. As I stated, it is not always the date that 
doesn't roll forward, sometimes I notice that the clock is several minutes 
behind where it ought to be. 

When unattended, the following are generally running minimized in Win 3.1:

Clock, WinFax Pro 3.0, Print Manager, MS-Word 1.1, File Manager, Program 
Manager

A random screen saver is generally running too.

I don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, I just

Invar shadow mask.  ViewMatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  As near as I have
been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,

But beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  Sharp, clear,

I'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow.  Something
like 90% of my CPU time is being spent reading the joystick, and this
is in a program that does nothing but printf() and JoyRead().

The problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like SMARTDRV ) and
so it is a slow as hell interface.  Can I read the joystick port in
a reasonably safe fashion via polling?  And that isn't platform or
clockspeed specific?

OK..... thanks to all of you who responded to my post.
here's the ""official"" response from orchid..
Orchid is aware of the problem, the new rev of the board (rev d) SHOULD         (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start
on april 15, I have no confirmation that production did start on this day
just the word of the tech on the other line.

now the flame......
you would think a company like Orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs. 
very poor tech support (the first 2 times I called I must have spoke with the
janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time I talked to a tech  named ""paul"" and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on.
until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy

A couple other problems with the 486DX/50:

1.)  System manufacturers had MAJOR problems solving the electromagnetic 
interference problems with 486DX/50 systems.  Getting an FCC-B (home use) 
certification required additional shielding in the system.

2.)  HEAT...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling 
fans on their 486DX2/66 chips.  I would guess that the 486DX/50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter.  And heat is the enemy of system 
reliability.

I will be returning the DF IO card they supplied for COM 4 (even though it
could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  This will free
up the COM port I need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either
the DF IO card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know

Otherwise I must say that the 486DX2/66 system has worked very well - no

I am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his DTK
I/O Plus II card working and it does not want to cooperate. The documentation
is no help at all. As an example, it says 'The serial port can be changed to
COM2 from COM1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(

There are 2 banks of jumpers. The first one is labeled as follows:
C1
C2
S2
P2
P1
G

The second bank is labeled ""IRQ"" and has the following labels:
5C
5S
4
3
3S
2C
2S

I have determined that the C1 & C2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as COM1 or COM2. The P1,P2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as LPT1 or LPT2. I am guessing that the ""G"" enables the game port and
the ""S2"" SHOULD enable the second serial port, but I can't get it to work. I
have tried numerous setting on the IRQ bank without success. I assume that
this bank must tell the card which IRQ's to use for both ports, but I don;t
know how.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

No.  In a standard ISA bus, the one that almost all non-laptop PCs use,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt.  This is due to
a screwup in the bus design.  For example, if your Soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7, then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times, depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
This precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

When two or more devices in an ISA bus PC share an interrupt, it's
because they're implemented by a single card.

I am not an expert. My understanding is the watts output of the power 
supply must exceed the sum of the hard disk watts requirement.

Typically, a 200W power supply is sufficient to power a PC.

Hope this help.

All,

During my attempts to find out how the AT harddisk controller
works I stumbled across I/O port 376h. The ""normal"" controller
ports are in the 1F0h-1F7h range, so what does this port do???

The only information I have upto now about this port is that it
is a write only port and the information you have to write in it
is related to the number of heads on the disks.

Could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info.

Thanks,

I was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
I ran QA/PLUS, Check It, Diagnose, as well as several shareware
memory checkers. I had a total of 8 meg SIMM in my system.
these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
without errors or found an error at some address that I couldn't
place on a memory chip. Out of exahperation I came up with
the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. I found 2
(moral : never buy memory stamped ""not for sensitive or critical 
applications"" on the back.
        anyway I did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a RAM drive to
test on. Although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
in windows. I did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
It has NEVER failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/
shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
pointing to an addreww which I have no idea on what chip it is.

p.s. man my typing stinks today and I don't feel like futzing around with

I can definitily say that you can use an RLL as Master and IDE as slave, as
I have just upgraded my machine with a 200Mb IDE ( And custom Controller
Mdl CI-1010 Extended IDE Controller ) While maintaining my RLL'd Wren as
master Drive.  The trick is the controller which supports up to 4 IDE Drives
while coexisting with existing Controllers ( MFM,RLL,ESDI,SCSI ).

So according to the Documentation it should work with ESDI, and I can assure
you it works with RLL.

I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not 
specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he 
has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
print the forms properly.

This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks

I got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. Their Assy
numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. They
are 3Com 3C505's aka Etherlink Plus cards. Check out ftp.3com.com, there
are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3Com
cards. I concluded that my card was the 505 after I ran their diagnostic
program for 3C505 succesfully (""..passes with flying colours"") :)

Anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under OS/2..?

How do you do bus-mastering on the ISA bus?

If we're talking ISA (AT) bus here, then you can only have 1 DMA channel
active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
So even though you can have at least 7 devices on a SCSI bus, explain how
all 7 of those devices can to DMA transfers through a single SCSI card
to the ISA-AT bus at the same time.

Also, I'm still trying to track down a copy of IBM's AT reference book,
but from their PC technical manual (page 2-93):

""The (FDD) adapter is buffered on the I.O bus and uses the System Board
direct memory access (DMA) for record data transfers.""
I expect to see something similar for the PC-AT HDD adapter.  
So the lowly low-density original PC FDD card used DMA and the PC-AT
HDD controller doesn't!?!?  That makes real sense.

486DX2/66 is faster for this if you are using DOS. PC Mag reviewed a bunch

They don't have a conflict because technically LPT1: does not use
IRQ7!.
     The Parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes
me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as IRQ7,
then onto the main processor as Int 0x0F. By default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it's interrupt line therefore
no Int 0x0F's will be sourced from the printer controller chip,
thus enabling other devices to use the actual IRQ7.

     Note, this applies to COM ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus, although COM's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring COM port
activity easier than polling the serial UART, thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused!.

Windows may be a different story....

But you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart,
jumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so

Half right.
SCSI-1 is SLOWER than IDE {5MB/s vs 8.3MB/s maximum.}
SCSI-2 {8-bit} has a faster BURST rate than IDE {Quarda}
SCSI-2 {16 and 32-BIT} are MUCH faster than IDE {Cyclone in June}

That is, if the special software is free, like Xfree86.  There are
vendors that sells Diamond X drivers for commercial Unices.  But
then, they charge $$$$.

I think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  This still
violates the FSF's policy of publically available code.

While this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
bought Diamond cards.  In Linux, for example, there are utilities
that will put the card in VESA mode before invoking X.  Of course,
this means no fine tuning of Diamond cards, but at least this
will allow those who're stuck with them to use Linux+X.

I agree with Mark's suggestion:  If you are buying a video card
for specialized free software, avoid Diamond.  But if you already
have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

Organization: University of Western Ontario, London
Nntp-Posting-Host: vega.irus.rri.uwo.ca
Lines: 81


Hi:

I need some advice (opinions?) regarding which PC would best suit my needs!
I want to use this (proposed) beast for basically four things:  

     -	Editing documents using WordPerfect 5.1 (under dos)

     -	Creating graphs/analyzing data using Sigmaplot V5.0 (under dos)

     -	Editing/playing with images using Aldus PhotoStyler, running under 
	Windows 3.1 - these images can be large, say 2k x 2k, 24bits/pixel

     -	Using the PC as an Xterminal, running DesqView/X 1.1 and Sun PC-NFS, 
	talking to our network of Sparcstation's - this is where a lot of
	the images/data come from, and is the most demanding of these tasks.

I've read, read, read PC magazines, performed benchmarks, read this newsgroup,
and decided that a ""nice"" system (price/performance) would be:

	486DX-50 256k cache, ISA, VLB, 16meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra Pro, 2 meg ram, local bus
	15"" monitor, 1280x1024 NI
	3Com Etherlink III 16bit
	Maxtor 240MB IDE hard drive

However, the parts don't fit!  Our local retailer apparently put one of these
together, only to discover that the ATI card wouldn't run at 50MHz - surprise
surprise.  Actually, after reading this group, I'm surprised that they even
have a 50MHz local bus running...

I have a choice now between basically the above system but with a
486DX2-66 with ISA and VLB,  or,   a 486DX-50 with EISA and no VLB (and thus
the non-local bus version of the ATI card).  Which is better, keeping in mind
that I'm primarily interested in the last two tasks?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  (I need to decide quickly, so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more!!)



BTW: We have a system now to perform these tasks, it has the following 
configuration:

	486DX-33 64k cache, ISA, 8 meg ram
	ATI Graphics Ultra+, 2 meg ram
	14"" monitor, 1024x768 NI
	SMC Ethercard 8 bit
	Maxtor 120MB IDE hard drive

We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!
~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or
been uncovered!  

There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish
running the local window manager.  Also, many functions under PhotoStyler take
a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive
don't leave much room for other apps.  Photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images.

I have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates.  This
machine sustains only 120k/sec over ethernet while our Sparcs sustain 600k/sec 
on the same network.  Going to the 16 bit version of the SMC card increases
transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it
make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice 
(above), for that reason.

Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

Any information is greatly appreciated.

I ran into the same problem when I upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem. Any time I give the modem a reset command [ATZ] while, in windows.
The computer locks up. If I give the ATZ command in DOS, it will work. My solution 
was to not give the modem the [ATZ] command thru windows. In the PROCOMM +
install process I told the program I have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. ATZ
was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. I called MS
about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict 
could be. The lockup accures using ANY windows comm program that gives the ATZ
command.

Technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486DX50 and
a 25MHz local bus.

I'm waiting for the mezzianine (sp?) VL bus that will be decoupled from
the main CPU clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers.

This will allow the use of ever faster CPUs with the same standard I/O
cards. Until the next buss spec...

Too right it does!

The --VERY VERY FIRST-- thing you do is make sure that --ALL-- files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't
already on your HD or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)
get copied to your HD (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).

If you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye.  (Well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)

Generally, head alignment is something I'd only trust to a good repair
shop (though there are/have been DIY guides).

A friend who owns a company that builds clones shared with me the fact that
the PCI chipset is NOT expensive -- how about $12?  Many money-hungry-clone
makers, no doubt, will attempt to price the boards high only because it's

If -anybody- can mail me to help me, I would be eternally grateful

I ran out of time on my last reply to this string and I don't
know if it was sent or not but. I have never heard of anyone that
had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with Midwest Micro. They may of thought that you didn't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
But it sounded as you didn't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. The fact that the PPI worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that can't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his/her system.
When you find out things like the fact the the EC led that looks like
you have connected to another EC modem, doesn't realy say that.
But that it only tells you that you have EC turned on, on your modem.
I think that these LED are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. Just like I bet someone took home a few extra $$$
in the last year for giving the PPI modems the PC-Magazine award
of the year. Not so for the stash (12) of them that I saw on my test
bench. I could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that I found with the PPI modems but I will try to control myself.
I will not even go into the 6 weeks it took PPI to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no I will
not go into that one nor will I go into talking to the parent co.
co from Hayes. I'll just say I hope you like your new modem and
maybe someone that can understand how to setup a modem will get
the one that you sent back, maybe a good friend of mine I hope!

I've been intently following the MAG thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail. There seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the MX15F. One
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4"").

Well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has
a very noticable barrel distortion. It's not dramatic, but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
fill the entire screen. The fact that it is worse on the right
side doesn't help matters.

What I'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? I don't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem. Does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? 
Are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?

The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in the

     Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this older
stuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)

     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not be
compadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.  

    Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip on
the board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read 
either :     62-000042-015 or
             62-000094-0x2

     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.

    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.

>The drive jumpers are as follows: (""8"" represents jumper)

    Looks right.

>Here are my questions:
>
>1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?

      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you have
the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:

              5 + +    open
              6 + +    open             
              7 + +    open        
              8 + +    open
              4 + +    closed
              3 + +    closed
              2 + +    open
              1 + +    open

    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.
Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).   

      If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll have
to look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.

>2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?

      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not
right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.   
     The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....

>3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?

     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:
       
        -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
   
    This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.

      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It's
just hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).

If you are using a TWISTED 34-way cable then move the jumper 
on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  Make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.

This may also help.

          must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital  
          XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3 
          or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT 
          controller you are using).

          NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1, 
          WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in 
          Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or 
          ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2) 
          instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or 
          the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
          etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then 
          solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the 
          modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1 
          (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION 
          TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY 
          ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the 
          WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
          be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the 
          interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

     HARD DISK CONTROLLERS FOR SCSI HARD DISK DRIVES
     
          
          7000-ASC - A SCSI host adapter that serves as an interface 
          between the AT bus and the SCSI bus.  All necessary drivers and 
          receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
          the SCSI bus through a 50 pin connector and to the AT bus 
          through two edge connectors.  The 7000-ASC utilizes jumper  
          configurable options that enable the address space, DMA channels 
          and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
          application.  The board also features word data transfer at 4 
          megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
          controller and a ROM BIOS.  Please note that the 7000-ASC 
          operates using standard DOS 3.2 or DOS 3.3 only.
          
          7000-FASST2 - This SCSI host adapter card provides the same 
          features as the 7000-ASC plus additional support capabilities 
          using software developed by Columbia Data Products.  The 7000-
          FASST2 will support MS-DOS 3.2-3.3, Compaq DOS 3.31, PC-DOS 4.0, 
          PC-MOS/386 version 2.1, XENIX, Microsoft Windows, Novell and 
          Sytos tape backup.
          
          WDATXT-FASST KIT - An ""unintelligent"" SCSI host adapter that is 
          compatible with the IBM XT, AT and compatible systems.  It uses 
          a 50 pin external SCSI bus ""D"" connector with a standard 50 pin 
          internal SCSI cable.  The WDATXT-FASST can be used as  both a 
          target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
          SCSI designers.  It also provides a low cost alternative for end-
          users desiring to install a SCSI peripheral device such as a 
          hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. The kit includes an 8-bit 
          SCSI HBA board, manual, FASST software diskettes and an internal 
          SCSI cable.

I am considering adding to my 386 system equipped with a 130meg Maxtor

However, I remember reading somewhere that to do this, you needed to 
reformat your original drive ?  Is this true ?  If so why ?  My drive is 
full and I really don't like the idea of to re-installing everything 
from floppy!!

Anybody seen the date get stuck?

I'm running MS-DOS 5.0 with a menu system alive all the time.  The machine
is left running all the time.

Suddenly, the date no longer rolls over.  The time is (reasonably) accurate
allways, but we have to change the date by hand every morning.  This involves
exiting the menu system to get to DOS.

Anyone have the slightest idea why this should be?  Even a clue as to whether
the hardware (battery? CMOS?) or DOS is broken?

What about this Double-Disk ? (had lots of problems with SStor too.)
How much memory do you get? (I've got 616K with EMM and SStor)
What about the on-line help (Really great in DRDOS)
Any help appreciated.

HI,
    Recently, when I run the Norton Disk surface test, I realize a slow
down in harddisk accessing.  At begining of the test, the harddisk will
be checked at the speed that usually is.  As the surface test scaned
half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  The
expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  I try to use
some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to
my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  The surface test
only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the
original speed after it gets over the section.  I am wondering whether
it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. Anyway help or comment

	I'm trying to transfer some software between two machines

	v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--I just talk to it
	at 56k and everything comes out clear.  This other modem,
	at the other machine, is a ""Turbomodem+"" from ""The 
	Complete PC"" (the machines are in seperate houses, 
	so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this
	much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines
	on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not
	pirated software).

	I am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  It will
	dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  But if I try to
	set the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing
	connects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).  
	His machine (a dx48633) has a 16550AFN UART, so that's
	not the problem.

	It seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	
	a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take
	dialing instructions at 56k (and respond OK, etc. to 
	other commands).  I don't have a comm program that can
	do precisely 14.4k.  

	I looked at the manual but it was unclear.  All I know is,
	I didn't have this trouble with the Intel--it came
	ready to connect this way.  Do I need to initialize it
	any way in particular?

	Also, it's _using_ V.42bis and V.42 (and MNP5) when connecting
	here (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far)
	but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?

        I'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
could use some feedback on a couple systems I'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.
 
        The system that looks the most interesting is the Budget 486/66 VLB
tower.  For about $2343 (delivered) it offers VLB, 8MB, 200MB IDE, a Mitsumi
CD-ROM (with software bundle), Media Vision Sound board, 14"" CTX 1468NI,
128K Cache, and the usual drives, ports, & OS software.  Since my budget is
$2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
IS too good to be true, of course). Among other things, I've never seen a
review of the Budget systems (or their parent company, Micro Smart), or of
the motherboard they are using (the Aetana). Any feedback would be
appreciated.
 
        In a similar vein, the second system I'm considering Midwest Micro's
Elite VESA 486/66 tower with a Diamond Viper (2MB) & Midwest Micro 14"" MI
monitor is one I've never seen reviewed anywhere.  I'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig
benefit here as well.
 
        Any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my
greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.

Howdy,

Sorry if this has been covered before:

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his
NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said ""No problem"" and went to work.
Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition 
was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a
32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS 
installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
""Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC"")...

Unfortunately there a *LOT* of such software.  I also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is BAD in this regard
is COMMERCIAL software.  Way too many commercial packages are very
poorly written.  But then most of the programs in MS-DOS are crap, such
as the PRINT command TSR that locks up your system for long periods of
time when the printer is full instead of trying every clock tick.

Back to comm software... I find success with TELIX (my COM3 at 3e8/5
works ok on TELIX).

Actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486DX.
(There is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).

The last time I was in microprocessor lab was in 1980, using Z-80.
So I don't know a lot of buzz terms in PC hardware.

Now I need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions.

Motherboard:
    I need 486-33 with 8 MB ram, with additonal slot for 8 more MB.
    I would like to get two VESA Local Bus. One for video, not sure
    what am I going to do with the other. 
    It must be able to run Unix.
    
    What are other questions that I should ask to ensure getting a
    quality stuff? What are other important features ?


Monitor:
    I want a 14"" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand
    to get. I can't afford NEC or SONY. What brands should I consider?
    Acer? Touch?

    What else should I ask?

Video Card: 
    I would like to run Framemaker. So I need a fast video card. Is Western
    Digital worth the $20 over Cirrus Logic?  Do I need more than 1M of 
    V-RAM?

    One company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. Is this normal?
    

Hard Drive:
    Segate, Western Digital, Conner all have the same price. Which one is
    more liable? which one has better performace?

Case/power supply:
    Given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?
    What is the adequate power supply?
    Is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?
    What features should I ask for?
    
Did I miss anything?

I am sure that there are a lot of semi-PC-literates reading this group.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

I purchased one personal computer and three for business from them. No 
problems. The only time I called tech support was for a minor question 
about a video driver and I had no problem getting through.

All four machines seem to be high quality and well made.  A 486dx50 EISA

I thought this was a neat feature until I noticed that
when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed.  This causes digital multiscan
monitors like my MAG MX17F to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections.  For this reason, I use the
""factory defaults"" for position/size on the ATI card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor.  The MAG (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is ""detected"".

Yes, this is a valid concern IMHO.  With the directly attached fan units I've
seen, it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all.  In other words, if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage, not just stop working temporarily.

My Zeos 486DX2/66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu, and it's
located so the front fan, which sucks air into the case, blows right on the
heat sink.  If that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise.  Essentially the 
arrangement you're talking about and a good idea IMHO.

For those of you who might be familiar with Insight Distribution
     Network, Inc. and their Multimedia Kits:

I'm seriously considering buying the Insight Talon TA-2000 MM Kit, which
is bundled with the CD-ROM drive with 265-280ms access time, 300Kb dtr,
multispin, multi-session Photo CD capability, etc., and with the PAS-16
sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit
I mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC
(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).

Other questions:

- Excuse my ignorance, but is ""Texel"" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM
  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?

- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the
  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)

Alternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my
uses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,
educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end
TA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something
else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.

Basically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED
these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably
directly to the email address below.

Thanks,

Koji

I'm arguing with the phone company about a similar problem.  We
installed a second phone line in our home (for our kids), and whenever
one of them is on THEIR line, the modem returns ""NO DIAL TONE"" on its
line.

When we pick up the phone and listen, we can hear my kids' voices
""bleed"" through.  Whenever we can hear this, the modem won't dial (even
though the dial tone is loud and clear through the modem speaker).

I think it's the phone company's problem, but they say they can't
(won't?) correct the problem...I'm still working on them. ;-}

     I would like to thank all those people who responded to my post.  I

Also, the connector on the back of it is of the male DB-37 pin variety.
As a result, I cannot easily find a cost-effective solution to use the drive.

With your date/time problems, you MIGHT have a problem with the Dallas
Clock Chip (I'm making a possibly bad assumption that your system has
a clock chip and that it's the standard Dallas Clock Chip).  I always
look at the battery and the clock chip when such things go wrong--
at least, as the first course of action.

I agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these SONY tubes,
however in the 17"" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black

to the wires holding up the Invar Shadow Mask, are quite annoying after

I must say that I have been a customer of Midwest Micro for over 4
years now, and have been well taken care of on each purchase.
I have had many friends that have bought that same modem and (THEY)
do have some experience with setting up modems, so there have been
no problems in 6 of them that I know of. The fact that your time
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong.
WHY you say because I must tell you of the 12 yes I say 12 PPI modems
that I have had in the past that I was trying to use on my bbs. They
all were junk and were replace 3 times each, to ther point that
I just said forget it and I wanted my money back. PPI's teck even
said that they didn't even repair them. That they just strip the
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem.
I think it was more your fault than Midwest Mirco's faulkt...Sam

I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast.  It's a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires
no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech)
advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied
customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Hope this helps,

motherboard.

Doesn't all VLB motherboard support bus mastering? I just bought a 486-33 VLB

but it said it ""supports bus master and slave modes"". Are these terms
synonymous?

Most importantly, which Winbench version are you using?  On my local bus ATI
Graphics Ultra Pro, I've gotten various Winbench scores from 15.8 million to
31 million winmarks, depending on the version.  Winbench 2.5 gives the most
optimistic scores, 3.11 gives the least.  A winmark rating is meaningless
without a corresponding version number.

You can configure devices for the same IRQ as long as you don't use them
*simultaneously*, under Dos at least. Both LPT1: and SB just sit there until
you tell them to do something. You can't configure a SoundBlaster for IRQ7
if you got an Ethernet Card which hits that IRQ a thousand times or so per 
second.

Hi!

One of the ASPI-drivers (I think it's the ASPICD) supports a /NORST

the ""attached"" fans look slick and work well but I'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

I prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.

on-chip fans from Fry's Electronics in the SF Bay Area are about 30.00. I
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

Hi,
   I'm currently in the process of writing a number of PD programs
for the sound blaster. The first of which is a CMF voice editor which
is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as I can get it to 
an FTP site).

Anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play
the FM synth remotely. The problem is that I have little or no info
on the SB midi port.

I have tried using the Sound blaster freedom project routines, however
this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and
loss the of note velocity data byte.

I am using Turbo C and would be grateful for any info or source fragments
may help. When I was in Berlin this summer I saw a book which seemed to
have all this information, but my German is poor to say the least, if anyone
has this book could they please mail me.

My second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file 
format be standard if you keep it secret ?) I need to know the file format 
for instrument bank files *.BNK and Roland music files *.ROL.

Finally does anyone have a source for displaying PCX or GIF files to EGA
or VGA monitors.

Please Help, You know it makes sense.

I think you got something wrong here.  You state that the system was a

 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
 leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
 You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
 etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer.

I have had a Zeos for a couple months.  While the experience was not
painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7
people I personally know) who have ordered Gateways.  (Of course,
several of the Gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as
Gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent
out...B{) 

I got the 1 MB Viper card.  The first one was defective, but Zeos
replaced it with only minor hassles.  This one works fine.  I haven't
noticed any problems in any of my applications.  I also ordered it
because of all the complaints about the ATI a few months ago.  Guess
you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average
stuff.... 

For my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no
monitor, viper, etc.) the Zeos was slightly cheaper than Gateway,
Austin, etc.  But this can change from month to month.

Hi all,
 
    I'm looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by Otronics (or
maybe Oltronics) called the Attache.  This little beauty is an 8088

floppies.  
    For serial ports it has 2 DB-15 connectors (one is labled 'printer')
and I can't figure out the pinouts for them.  I also don't know if they 
are standard com ports addressable as COM1 and COM2.  I have figured out 
that they'll only work with DOS 2.something.  
    
    If anyone can give me some pointers on this one, I'd be most

From a recent BYTE magazine i got the following:

[Question and part of the answer deleted]

  If you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to
make.  On a serial RS-232 nine-pin port, use a female DB-9 connector and
connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  For serial RS-232 
25-pin ports, you'll need a female DB-25 connector with pins 1 to 7;
2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25
connected.  To test a Centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to
connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male
DB-25 connector.

Well, I tried this method based on responses from several people.  Either
I am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector.  I ended up having
to destroy the connector, put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and 
then plug them into the SB connector in the correct order.  It works great 
this way so this turned out just fine.  It certainly sounded easy based on
other people's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...

I am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase.  One

read the fine print between double warranty policies of Amex and Citibank
VISA.  Sure, both will allow you double warranty on computers, but Citibank
has a maximum claim of $250.00.  Could you imagine trying to get your
monitor or mother board fixed for $250.00?  Amex has NO limit on claims.

Remember, if you use Amex, you must either send a copy of the warranty info
to them in 30 days from purchase, or you must call them to pre-register and
then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre-register
pak arrived today).  Citibank VISA requires no pre-registration.

    I've been using the Build59 drivers on a GW2K 4DX2-66V for several
weeks with no problems. I'm running Windows in 1024x758 and all software
I've run has worked fine. This includes many games and the CD-based

I'd recommend you give them a try.

I work for a small PC OEM. We offer both a personal and professional

There are several manufacturers.

Sometimes - depends on the specific fan model.

N(P>Do all CPU fans derive their power from spare drive power lines?

All the ones I've seen do; many come with a 'Y' connector, so you don't
have to have a ""spare"" connector.

None.

Touch a 486DX-50 chip after its been running a few minutes - you won't
feel the fan is a waste!

Depends on the model. Many use clips - make sure you use heat sink
grease, or heat transfering tape, or you will have wasted your money.

N(P>Roughly how much cooler will the CPU be with a fan as opposed to
without? (an advert I've read claims 85F vs 185F)

Hi,

    I've just replaced my existing DTC SCSI controller with an Adaptec 1542B,
and am now having trouble restoring from a Jumbo 250 tape drive.

    I had no trouble installing the Adaptec and DOS recognises both the SCSI
drive and an existing IDE drive - however when I went to restore the backups
from the Jumbo tape I found that it was extremely slow (estimated time 3 mins
actual time 15 min!) I have no trouble restoring from the same tape to the IDE
drive.

    I seem to remember reading that some settings had to be changed to 
enable the Jumbo drive and the Adaptec to work together but I can't find any
mention of it in the manuals.

 My system config is:
   i486DX/33 4Mb 
   Adaptec 1542B running 180Mb Fujitsu SCSI
   IDE Controller running 200Mb IDE
   Jumbo 250 running off floppy controller on IDE

  Any help would be appreciated 

   Thanks,

Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

I don't think FD is a problem.  Since FD is much sloooooooowwwwwwer

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new
digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone
from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply ""MD
is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data"", then when
pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!

I just tried a few experiments. I cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 lines)

Telix (DOS) in an OS/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec!

UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min!
UW/WIN in Windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
UW/WIN in a seamless OS/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a
                                                little faster (I had to keep
                                                hitting the space bar)

I was using an ATI Wonder XL video card, by the way.

So PC-Xview for DOS looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling
in OS/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty
good).

I tried it under PC-Xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.
The modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the
bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.

I have WD1007-WA2 ESDI controller with ROM BIOS v.1.1.
It has been working fine until I recently upgraded motherboard to 386-40MHz.
Now, my Maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the
drive is not accessed.  Of course, with numourous hard disk controller errors.
These symptoms disappear when I switch to non-turbo mode (8 MHz).
I suspect some timing dependent Rom Bios routines. (There's a newer version
2.x) Could anybody help me on this?
By the way, my new mother board has AMI Bios, 128k Cache, 8 MHz bus, and
works fine with my old MFM drives (I had to dig them up). :-(
Also, I will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers
(tech support/BBS) for Western Digital.
Many thanks in advance.

I have a Logitech 2S-2f (or 2f-2S) 2-button mouse that I want to
interface to a serial port of a different (non-ibm-compatible) system.
The mouse is XT/AT/PS2 compatible, with a DB25 connector.  I tried
to reverse engineer the mouse, but it has a micro-controller inside
it.

If I could get the DB25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines
that support it, I could map all this into my target system?

Anyone know where I might get the pin-out or the BIOS routines?
Are the routines published someplace convenient?

Thanks!

Can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal
width hides out on the Tseng Labs ET4000 with a 15/16/24 bit dac?
I am trying to use the 640x480x16M mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)I have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos, but I
am not sure I trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
Anyway, the problem is that in this mode, the Horizontal Total Register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27, but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xEF, so 0x27 is nonsense. A resonable value would be 0x0127 - so is
there a high bit, and if so, where is it?
Also, how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency?). The documentation isn't really very
clear (tseng.txt from  vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
My card is a MegaVga/1024 1Mb card. Seems to have a Tseng Labs Bios (ver 8.05 I
think.) Works nicely under dos, and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non-hicolor modes. Great for running X-windows in up to 1152x900x256ni - if your

Please email the answer, as I can't read news very often.

First of all, thanks to those of you who responded, both here and via e-mail.
The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you.

Now, following up to my earlier post:
[...]
: Disk controller:  Acculogic sIDE-3 2 hard/2 floppy IDE controller
:   Jumpers:  All defaulted (shown as *):  
:     Normal IRQ*/delayed IRQ     Primary*/secondary floppy address
:     Single*/dual speed floppy   Primary*/secondary IDE address

: 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter
: 	      Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface 
: 		Configured with default IRQ 2, mem address 0330

I opened up the box and removed all the ""other cards"" above.  No help there.
Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed
IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_
driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put 
everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.

I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!,
the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds 
before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back
to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.

O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any 
words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with
my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.  
When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is
fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen 
gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3/4"" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can
manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't 
been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and
both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried
to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...
So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what
to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm
not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.

P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set-
ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size
of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

and have an Archive VP402 interface card connected to a QIC-02 tape
drive. Now the simple question is, does anybody in netland know were I
can get some software for msdos (ver 5.0) to run this setup, freeware
or shareware preferred .

Thanks in advance,
                   Darryl

sorry for the repost but I'm still getting to grips with Pnews.

This isn't at all too high of a price.  Keep in mind that you get *8* meg of 
ram, a *local bus* IDE *and* SVGA card,  a *250* mb hd, and a *15""* 
monitor.  The local bus IDE and SVGA really kick butt in Windows.  I have

Well, not to be picky, but the V in VLB stands for VESA.
While the V in VESA stands for video, saying the V in VLB stands
for video is not entirely correct.

Does anybody have a data-sheet handly for the above-mentioned card?  I
bought one, sans manual at a local surplus shop, and want to try it out
with the Crywyr packet driver suite.  

The IRQ and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but I
don't grok the settings of W10-W18 (also labelled A15 through A18).
Could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
to what I/O addresses?

Is there anything else about this card I should know, before I
plug&play?

I don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), I see this
as something that was designed-in intentionally.

So it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit EISA DMA)
would require an update to the chipset.  An update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design.

What I'm saing is:  The motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix.  In my mind the fix is a updated chipset from HINT 
along with a possible motherboard layout update.  This is not simple.
If I were you I would be cautious about this.

You might look into the Advanced Integration Research (AIR) VL/EISA
motherboard.  All slots are EISA/ISA capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are
VL-bus capable.  The AIR people confirmed this board supports 'real'
32-bit EISA DMA (I called them).  Pentium/P5 (?) capable.  Less expensive
than equivalent AMI or Micronics VL/EISA board.

Look in Computer Shopper (April '93).  The ZENON ads show the AIR mother-
board.  A associate bought the AIR board and is pleased with it.  I'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the HAWK board for the
AIR board.

Model number of AIR board (with 486-33DX) is B433EI2.  You can call
Motherboard Warehouse (for example) for a price.  Phone #'s included
below.

I ran a 386-33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no
major effects (yeah, no case at all, MB sitting on a static bag)
other than the noise from the Poersupply it ran pretty good.
as for cooling problems I bought a 12-14 inch fan and  turned
it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.

I did finally get a case though and I am still running the parts
with no ill effects.

I also had no kids to spill things on the MB> I had no cat leaving
hair on the MB etc. etc. on and on....

the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the MB cool

I recall reading a review article in PC Computing wherein they reported
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using Stacker 3.0.
This was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. Does
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of Stacker
and Dblspace?

That is correct.  in DOS you can use IRQ 7 for your SB.You can't do

I think Washburn has very competitive prices compared to other AMI distributers,plus I liked  the fact he's a EE that knows what he's talking about
concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via CompuServe for non  
critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.

the A/D-Converter uses in non interleave mode.

The board must content an A/D-Converter similar to Analog Devices AD 9028 or 
AD 9038 or if available a faster on.

If you a PC-Board (16-bit slot, ISA) with this specification or better, please
send me an EMail

This is a fundamental aspect of Novell's business; they wouldn't be
where they are if they didn't live up to their ""Novell Does Printing""
slogan.  We run 6 printers of varying types off our Novell network;
I'm sure there are places with hundreds.

RTFM on the CAPTURE command, PRINTCON, PSERVER, and the sections of
the Windows 3.1 manual which cover network printing.  If you haven't bought
Novell's products yet, rephrase your question and look for information about
how *well* various competitors do printing.

The last I heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate

This was some months ago.

It's a shame.  The driver is the best memory manager I have found
ANYWHERE.  It doesn't require V8086 mode (like QEMM) so it works with
Ultima 7.  It doesn't take ANY memory (runs, then exits).

If only the EMM provider were a little faster and more stable.

I've been told by our local computer guru that you can't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning.  I took him at his word, and I

there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called

amongst which is also a detailed description of all Floppy controller

it is possible to read an entire track including all gaps, sector

After a rough start purchasing a 486 system (see earlier post), I'm trying
again.  I'm looking at the following system offered by EPS Technologies:

- 486dx 33mhz w/ 256K static RAM cache,AMI Bios
- 3 32-bit VESA local bus slots, 3 16-bit slots, 1 8-bit slot

- 32-bit vesa local bus video card w/ 1mb RAM 1024 X 768 NI (I *think* it's an
   Orchid Fahrenheit 1280 card)
- 14"" NI Multisync monitor 1024 X 768
- 101 Keyboard
- 200 Watt power supply
- Windows 3.1, Mouse, DOS 6.0
- *3* years limited warranty
- 1 year on-site service

I'm probably going to add the $125 for a 15"" flat-screen digital monitor, and
will also want to go for at least 8 mb RAM ($159 extra).

Has anyone bought from EPS Technologies, particularly a system like the one
I'm considering.  I'm especially interested in their warrantee and service.
Can anyone recommend other companies who offer similar packages, with support,

I have a Sony 1604S 17"" monitor and I don't see any lines across
the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.
But because of the hor. lines and poping that I do see and hear
when I am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back
to anything of less. I would not buy another Sony at what ever price.
Oh ya this is I guess a 15"" viewing area. It don't impress me one bit!   Sam

I had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with NT and
in some cases DOS. I sent mine back, but it is my understanding that
on some systems such as Micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.

I've yet to hear from someone running a 34F on any motherboard with
NT without shutting off the cache.

If you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.

I'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 'T' expanders
used in the low-profile cases.  They allow 3-5 slots staggered on either
side of the card.  You can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) 
have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  This is actually how it is done in the low
profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 'T' connector in one slot, 
and the expansion cards plugged into the 'T'.  I guess you could do this at 
each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  

The 'T' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics
on it.  The only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system,
that may not be a problem.

Don't know about performance, though.  I'll leave that discussion to the 
engineers.

This isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. I've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
(and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed).

I have a 486/33 IBM clone with two serial ports (com1, com2) and mouse port.
Both the serial ports are directly sitting on the mother board.  I tried to
install a 2400 buad Hayes internal modem, but it doesnt work.  Once I dial any
number the system locks.  I do not hear any click or ring before it the system
hangs.  The modem has a 2 pin dip switch to select the appropriate port.  Once 
I change the settings on the dip switch, the system starts working again.

Then I bought a 2400 baud Hayes external modem and checked the system.  It
works fine with both the serial ports.  The internal modem has been checked on
another machine and it works fine, but does not work on my machine.

Can anyone please help me to find the problem.

Most fellow Diamond video board owners with whom I've corresponded may
or may not share your opinion about the proprietary clocking scheme, but
all of those with whom I've chatted have NOT been thrilled with the
Window's drivers, either.  Some modes work fine, but others cause
strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  Many have also voiced their
strong discontent to Diamond's ambivalent attitude toward OS/2 drivers.

Come to think of it, though, I hear and see a lot of complaints about
the ATI boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
much better.

Does ANYONE have an accelerated video board with drivers for Windows
(OS/2?) where ALL the modes function properly?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Subject: Upgrade 386SX-25 to 386DX-40 ?
Organization: Edinburgh University
Lines: 41

I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I am
running Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for my
flatmates' games.

My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9
Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.

Basically I have two choices

1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or
2) Get some sort of 486.

Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high.
The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start at
this price for a SX-25.

I have a couple of questions.

1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a
386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Point
operations.

2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?

Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait for
AMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?

	Any experiences will be most helpful ...

		Kenny.

PS. Example prices:

	386DX-40+copro M/board	~$270
	486DX33	M/board		~$580

XGA or XGA-2?  For the original XGA you just need something that can do
1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them ""8514 compatible"" and they
should get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi-
syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run them
in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
1360x1024x16.

	Very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible
with the ISA bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current EISA
implementation really is.

	From what I've seen, the PCI bus will just be a new 32bit 33MHz
intelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like,
not jumpers...)  Hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the AMIGA 
Zorro III bus....

	VL Bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking...

If you bought your IDE drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
perform a low level format. Even if the 1st HD is already partitioned
into C and D, FDISK will automatically assign the 2 nd HD to D and 
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to E.

Hello, I've been following discussions on 17"" monitors in 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware and noted that the Nanao seems to get very good
reviews.  I'm interested in getting more information about Nanao's products
as well as some others that may fit the bill.   

I would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 NI.
I'm envisioning using this monitor on an Amiga 4000 or Amiga 2000 w/a graphics
board like the Retina, and/or on a Sun like the SPARCstation LX.  Basically
I want a high resolution versital monitor.  This monitor need not be large
(=>17"") if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above.  I've been
very happy with a 16"" on Suns and could probably cope with smaller at home.

I'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality Sony and Hitatchi
monitors since they seem to be used on Sun's fairly often and look pretty
good (to me at least).  I haven't seem them brought up in c.s.i.p.h very
often as are Mag and Viewsonic.

Ok, stuff I'd like to find out:  How can I get ahold of Nanao?  What are
the products in their line?  What are the technical specs?  Esp. what
scan freq and max resolutions can they handle?  What's list and street
cost - if avail. from a third party, and where can I get ahold of them? 
Same info for Sony and Hitatchi.

Thank you very much!!

A couple of months ago I tried out a Hercules Graphite card.  A pretty nice
board.  Fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the
SVGA modes I have whined about here on occasion.  At the time I was just
buying a VLB system, so after checking out the card I sent it back.  I wanted
a VLB card, and purchased a Fahrenheit VLB card.  This card is fairly fast,
will do 70 Hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my CD-ROMS
(the SVGA thing -- I think; I have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards I have tried.  I have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody...).  The monitor I am using it with is a 17"" Magnavox,
which also tops out at 1024x768x70 Hz so its really a pretty good match.

But...

That is for my wife.  I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 for myself, and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it.  I want > 70Hz refresh,
and would really like it to handle my CD-Roms.  I tried the Orchid P9000,
which did neither of those things (though Robert at Wietek did say that the
>70Hz was possible if I modifed the driver data base).  So my thoughts go back
to Hercules.  They were supposed to be coming out with a VLB version of the
Graphite around the end of March.  I have heard precisely ZERO about it since
then.  Does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities
(and price) it has?

Any info would be most appreciated.

Organization: Indiana University

Greetings,

        Please forgive me if this is FAQ. If there is source on this kind of info, 
please let me know. I just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),
and I am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.

        The station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big
case. I have SONY 1304 monitor, SyQuest drive (Mac), and maybe a cd-rom
reader (Mac) for it. Here are the questions I have so far:
1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case?
2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station? 
I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in?
What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost?
Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if
I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC- 
quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.

Any input is welcome.

Thank you.

I need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5"") and ideally would like to
be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single PC.
[Yes, I know that services to do this exist.] 

I know that standard ISA bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time. I know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 
floppies with serialized access. I know that microchannel machines can keep 
more than one floppy active simultaneously. But does anyone have a controller 
for an ISA bus PC that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
How about for an EISA machine?

If the limitation is a software limitation, I can work around that by using
OS/2 1.3 on my PC-286.

New or used, I'm interested.

...

This is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
and users alike.  COM3, for example, is simply the third equipped COMM
port, not necessarily the one with I/O address 3E8.  The BIOS just
searches sequentially through a set of potential COMM port addresses.  The
first equipped port it finds will become COM1, etc.  If you're playing by
the rules, you can't have a COM4 unless you have a COM3 equipped.  The set
of ""standard"" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the BIOS searches the I/O address space in its search for
serial ports.

So, what you have is indeed COM3 at the non-standard address 2E8.  Were
this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the BIOS
to determine the number of installed COMM ports would not find it, as the
field in the BIOS data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 COMM ports installed.  (Frankly, I don't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

Actually, the iAPX86 family has a HALT instruction that causes the CPU to
cease processing instructions.  The CPU resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  This is different
from the power management facilities Victor mentions.  Of course, whether an
operating system's idle loop uses the HALT instruction is another matter
entirely.

This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to
1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no trouble
setting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,
just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applications
are failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGA
they're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).
Every new chip set confuses them.

I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (and
it's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need to
fix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  If
you're really interested, though, take a look at the text file
P9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in the
P9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copy
of the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DAT
file, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choices
should show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.
You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,
too.)

The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
Hercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thing
with WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the
8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to use
benchmarks from ""unbiased"" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,
etc.

I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY and

Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows has
hooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT's
use of a hardwired ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack"" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless in
real applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the ""Bart
Simpson optimization,"" in which you save the bitmap of the
most-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do a
screen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row.  (We call it the ""Bart Simpson optimization""
because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: he
could right ""I will not cheat on benchmarks"" a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

These questions can be answered by any dealer of IBM Value Points, but, I will
provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board
video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and
you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of
them with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and
either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.

Do not buy a 486SX sytem.

My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When
you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they
get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large
steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX
models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.

Subject: Question about IRQ2 and IRQ9
Organization: Texas Instruments Component Test Facility

I have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  Each port has the option of
using IRQ 2,3,4 or 5.  I also have two serial ports on a multi-I/O card,
and the ports can be set to IRQ 3,4,5,7 or 9.  From other posts I've read,
I get the impression that IRQ2 on the 8-bit card is the same as IRQ9 on
the multi-I/O card.  Am I right?

Simple.  First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might be
some confusion.  It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to use
the same interrupt.  They can not *share* the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

Here is an example.  For some time, I was short of ""free interrupts.""  I had a
tape controller (not a ""floppy tape"") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.  (It's an
*old* tape drive.)  My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where my
modem is).  I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously.  When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupt
handler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.  If the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt, kermit would not have a clue what to do with/for the tape
controller.  (And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it would
most likely ""hang."")  Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, it
installs an interrupt handler for IRQ3.  That handler won't do anything for
the serial port.

Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.  Instead, the BIOS polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
That's why you can have your sound card and LPT1 both configured to use IRQ7.
Try that on NT and see how far you'll get. :-)

I have two SCSI hard drives, each has 512KB of 'cache'.

There several reasons for this :-

When the drive has read requested data from the disk the SCSI bus may be
busy. This data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

When the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. It needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

In these situations the memory is being used as a buffer NOT a cache!

May be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...

In a 25-pin serial loopback plug, you need to connect the following
pins:

pin 1 to pin 7
pin 2 to pin 3
pins 4, 5 and 8 together
pins 6, 11, 20 and 22 together
pins 15, 17 and 23 together,
pin 18 to pin 25.

That should do it.  Note that *a lot* of these pins are redundant
in many implementations....

[Stuff about the connection between IDE and IDA deleated]

If IDE speed come from IDA WHERE does the 8.3MB/s sighted for IDE come from?

SCSI is not complex. It is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.
There are THREE key differences in SCSI; the controller chip, the port, and
the software.  THAT IS IT.
Let us look as SCSi in from THIS stand point.

SCSI-1: asynchronous and synchronous modes {SOFTWARE SCSI DRIVER ONLY}
 asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode {only 0-3MB/s vs. 0-5MB/s}
 synchronous speeds can be reached by most SCSi-1 divices with a
 rewrite of the software driver {As is the case for the Mac Quadra.}

SCSI-2 {8-bit}: THIS is the main source for the confusion. This differs from
 SCSI-1 ONLY in the controler chip in most machines.  In the Mac and some PCs
 this is called 'fast SCSI-1' because it uses SCSI-1 ports and software drivers
 AND can produce SCSI-2 SPEEDS through SCSI-1 INSPITE of this even in the 
 slower asynchronous mode.  Average speed in asynchronous SCSi-1 mode 
 4-6MB/s with 8MB/s{See in both Quadras and higher end PCs} Synchronous
 mode just allows a higher burst rate {10/MB/s}

SCSI-2 {16-bit}: TWO versions-Wide/Fast.  Wide SCSI-2 requires TWO things
 over 8-bit SCSI-2:  a SCSI-2 software driver and a wide SCSI port on the
 machine and the external device.
 Fast SCSI-2 also requires TWO things over 8-bit SCSI-2: SCSI-2 driver
 software and that the RECIEVING devise support 16-bit fast SCSI-2.
 Speed of both is the same: 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst.

SCSI-2 {32-bit}:  Also know as Wide AND Fast SCSI.  Over 8-bit SCSI-2 this
 requires: SCSI-2 driver software, wide SCSI-2 port, and that the RECIEVING
 devices ALSO have a 32-bit mode SCSI-2 chip.  As expected this is VERY
 expencive.  Speed: 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s bursts
 

As I said SIMPLE.  Seven versions of SCSI seperated by software, the 
controler chip, and the port. Standarize the SOFTWARE and it DROPS to
only FIVE versions of SCSI seperate by only HARDWARE {the chip and the port}

I recently bought a Leading Edge 80386DX-33 <mini tower case> and everything
works fine. Leading Edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. I would
tend to say that it is a decent deal. The only things you might want to be
wary about is that my L.E. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.
Ie: The motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.
Some people don't like these configurations. The second thing is that
whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were
doing. The installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the
SVGA card/Monitor. Look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself.

Re: Problems with S3-initialization

As described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization

Unlock Advanced Display Functions

After these operations the FIFO-stack of the S3 should be empty.
When we watch the status (Graph. Proc. Status), we always get
the value 0FH instead of 0H.
Full would mean 0FFH (8 places occupied), empty would mean 0H
(0 places occupied).

It is possible to read this register in two different ways. 
Both times we get different results.

  I need the jumper settings for the achieve io card...usually found in
xt's.  It is affecting my video card and forcing the machine into 40 col
mode.  Any help?

Diamond Video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 
may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that
come with them might make windows BLINDINGLY fast, BUT:

If you're considering buying a system, with a view to using
it to run Unix (Linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software,
there is a good chance that it WILL NOT WORK with the Diamond cards.
This is due to Diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware:
it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
(specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure
agreements.

This made it impossible for the Free Software Foundation to provide
X-Windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to 
divulge programming neccessities.

As far as I know only Diamond has this propriety on it's info.

   Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways
lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My
machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from
when I called the order in. 

   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the 
peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway 
documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.
The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came
with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)
was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and 
has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a 
lot to do with it. 

   It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications. 
I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then ""maps"" the other
machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can ""cd"" to these
drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a
peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.
It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this
machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the 
peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. 

  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also
by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430
credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!

  So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it
was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)

The only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.

> which one is better?

mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
The working of both drivers is totally the same.

When I ran dos, I preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
because some programs won't run with some drivers and I could choose the
ones I needed during startup. But with DRDOS6, this advantage is gone,
because DRDOS lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several 
useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by 
removing the fan altogether!

Two variables: 
1) I always run my PC without the cover, and 
2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference.

Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so 
I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer 
may save my PC... Thanks.

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

I never thought I'd contribute to a Gateway thread, either pro or con, but
my spleen could use a little venting.  The scenario:

	1 - Ordered a DX2/50 w/ Ultrastor 34F Local Bus HD controller
	2 - Receive system 10 days after ordering (Happy)
	3 - Discover Ultrastor 14F ISA HD Controller inside (unhappy)
	4 - Call Gateway, receive the correct controller in 5 days 
		(getting happier)
	5 - New controller doesn't work (unhappy again)
	6 - Call Gateway again, get another controller in 5 more days
			(cooling off, the end is in sight)
	7 - This controller doesn't work either, motherboard is bad
		(VERY unhappy)

Gateway's solution:  They will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
	and have on-site service install it for me.
BUT, I have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9-5 M-f.  I say, no way I've already blown about 20 hours
with this, about 10 of them on hold and I don't have the time or $$
to take a day off work.  Also, my 30 day return period is almost over and
I've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes.  So, the whole 
thing is going back.  
  I was extremely upset when I began this post because the support rep told me
that I would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system, but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me.  Fortunately, I just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have UPS come and pick everything
up gratis. The only downside is that now I have to order another computer.

I would really like to try Gateway again, I'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to Customer Service or Tech Support
again...  I think their products are great for the most part, but I'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
Are other mail order companies as difficult to contact?  I know Gateway is
booming, and for good reason, but I don't know if I can take it again.
Oh well, I feel better now...

Is there a utility out there that would tell me what DMA's my system

Subject: Mounting CPU Cooler in vertical case
Organization: Mail Group

I just installed a DX2-66 CPU in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a CPU 
cooler on the chip.  After about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough 
to dislodge the CPU from its mount.  It ended up bending a few pins
on the CPU, but luckily the power was not on yet.  I ended up
pressing the CPU deeply into its socket and then putting the CPU
cooler back on.  So far so good.

Have others had this problem?  How do you ensure that the weight of
the CPU fan and heatsink do not eventually work the CPU out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?
