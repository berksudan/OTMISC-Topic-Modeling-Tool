1)    I have an old Jasmine drive which I cannot use with my new system.
 My understanding is that I have to upsate the driver with a more modern
one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( I have seen formatters for <$20
buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

    Would you believe that there is a letter in MacWEEK this week from
one of the hardware types at Digital Eclipse. He says that they run
tests on all of the components to see if they will perform at the
upgraded speed. If they do not then DESI replaces them with ones that

        (Alpha @150MHz  - 74 SPECint92,126 SPECfp92 - just for comparison)

Not in a clock-doubled system. There isn't a doubling in performance, but
it _is_ quite significant. Maybe about a 70% increase in performance.

Besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. I mean,
who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns SIMMs? Note that this
memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 MHz.

Why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon? If you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
be using SndPlay. Instead, make a channel and use BufferCmds
to play sounds on it. It works great. You can add CallBacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. Before it gets empty.

Callbacks are very reliable, I found them 100% reliable, even
under System 4.1. I was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on System 6.0 with the IM-V
documentation.

You probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels, of course you didn't get called. In general, if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel, possibly the same one multiple times. This might be
because you are calling SndPlay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. Most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. You need to resedit
the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel's synth. Then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
want. You'll probably want to switch to BufferCmd's, since you
are going to have to use SndDoCommand anyway to add callbacks.

Now before you go ahead and tell me I am full of it, and the
sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, Spectre uses
it. And it works great. If Spectre can spare the CPU time, you
can too.

One little disclaimer: There are some out there who say the
Sound Manager in the IIsi can't be made to work right. I'm not
sure either way, but I know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
Sound Manager.

A similar reason is why people at work, used to seeing SCO unix running
on a 486, are suprised when they see my Sun-3 at home running faster w/a 16MHz
68020/68881.  The Sun was designed from the ground up for UNIX, the PC
wasn't.

This is why you need a gargantuan processor to run Windows.  The basic
design of the box is all wrong. (Would've been better if MS had put most
of Windows on a plug-in ROM card from day one. (priced at $24.95 or
so...) People woulda loved it.

A lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  
interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed  
to factual information, etc.).  What it sounds like to me is that this guy  
has had an experience with one flaky Centris 610 and formed an  
all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  I've seen lots of  
people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any

        Thank you very much. These computers behave exactly like what 
you're describing. Now, my question. I am running on the lowest of all 
budgets, public education. How can I analyze this? All I need is some 
sort of packet counter. Do any exist, and where are they?
        Thanks again,

  At work we have a small appletalk network with 3 macs and  couple of printers.
We also have a PC that has some specialized accounting software that we would 
like to operate from any of the macs. We have Soft PC, and I have found that the
software works just fine under it, but I would like to have all of the data
for the program reside at one place (the PC hard disk). So my question for you
is(actually questions)

 1) is there a board for the PC that will allow you to hook into an appletalk
    network?

 2) if #1 is possible, is there any software/hardware combination that will 
    allow me to mount the PC hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so I
    can use Soft PC to run the application?

 3) if #1 or #2 is impossible, is there any other way to accomplish what I am
    after?

Ok I want to get a color Mac I don't care if it is an LC or a Mac II or
what but I want to go to a color machine.  I'd prefer to trade my
present Mac SE system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
system as right now I'm not full of the $$$ to buy a color system
outright.
Here's what my Mac SE system has...

Mac SE 4/20 with internal 800K drive
20 Meg external
External 800K drive
ImageWriter II with 4 color ribbon

Stuff that can go with it......
I've got 3 modems and I'd be willing to give 1 of the 9600's and the
2400 with the system

MultiTech Multimodem II (9600 data/fax)
U.S. Robotics Sportster (9600 data)
Microcom QX/12K         (normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
but it will do faster if connected to another Microcom)

The USR and the MultiTech are both brand-new

The problem is that the pins in the ADB connector 
are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
cable a little while inserting it, you short the ADB
port. If you take it to an Apple Repair Centre, that
means a new motherboard (though a component replace IS
physically possible)

Same goes for serial ports (LocalTalk as well)

Hmm, I don't know where this information concerning the cable and the

Cleveland, and inside was a Mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
and a lifetime warranty.  The whole package was assembled at AT&T Paradyne,

Ok.  I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.
It's small enough that I will attach it.

I have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB
cache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to
40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective
difference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.  A simple cache
card certainly does not transform a IIsi into something enormously
better.  I do not have an FPU.

The conventional wisdom says that cache cards from all of the makers
offer about the same speedup and that there is not much difference
between 32K and 64K caches.  I bought mine from Third Wave for well
under $150.  I have had absolutely no problems at all with it.

If you get *complete* speedometer runs for a 32K cache, I'd like to
see them.  Let's check the conventional wisdom!  The so called
""Performance Rating"" numbers by themselves are of no interest. 

Cheers.

Hi there!

What is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for
non-Apple drives? I would mainly need it for a SyQuest removable media
drive, but maybe for some normal drives too.
I have heard and seen good things about SilverLining, but don't know
any competitors. It does not need to be fancy, filled with features...
I more like it affordable.

Thanks

Sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the IIvx's he has in
stock.  I can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that 
 1. a C610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.
 2. an LCIII is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.
So your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
that IIvx's are a much better buy than a C610 just so he can get rid of all
his old stock!

No disrespect to dealers or the IIvx intended!

  Your source is wrong.  The double speed CD300 is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk.  The LC can easily handle the SCSI transfer rate of the
CD300.  None of the current Macs, even the Quadras, support SCSI-2 unless
you get a SCSI-2 Nubus Card.

  You don't have to have double speed to use PhotoCD.  It's just faster
reading images off of a disk.  I think that the CD150 can handle PhotoCD,
but only single session.  The CD300 can do multisession PhotoCD.

The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new
wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print
GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer
(and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not
possible).

This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to
Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It
is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.

SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour
version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the
'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it
gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).

There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older
computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been
upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal
with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult 
time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).

Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT
Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to
do so, whatever Mac you were using. (And I am pretty sure that the Select 300
is NOT a POSTSCRIPT printer [? correct me if I'm wrong?]).

	Hello,

a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to be
used to ""recycle your old SIMMs,"" when you upgraded memory.  I don't

any of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included software
to make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS 
he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly
good idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?  
Are they still in business, or does anyone know where I can get a used one
if they are no longer made?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Please

Hello all,

If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and
motherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mail
order places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I part
with over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700
to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950.

Please email me or post to this group w/ info,

Thanks in advance,
Andy

So far I have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,
but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.
However, when I learned typing in school some years ago, I was taught
to write 'b' with my right hand. Is this a difference between Danish
and American typing, or what???

Thanks a lot in advance!

I have a mac plus with 2.5MB RAM. I have just bought an extra 2MB so that
I can have the max 4MB RAM that a plus supports. However, I can't get it
to boot after I install the 2 extra SIMMs. Instead I get a sad mac (Sorry,
but I can't remember the code). Looking at the motherboard, I can see
that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says ""256Kb path -
1 row"". I assume that was done when the first 1MB SIMMs were added.

So, my question is: Are there any other resistors that need snipping? 
				or, Do I have bum SIMMs which need to be exchanged?

Any and all advice will be appreciated.

    I think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
literature and price lists being confused themselves. Since there are
two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
an FPU it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.

>>I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting

    Well, then allow me to end your confusion. The C650 ONLY come with
an LC040 in the base 4/80 configuration. If you are not getting this
configuration then you are getting an FPU.

>>Why say ""optional"" if it's built in?

    Good question. I have been wondering that since Feb. 10th.

>If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with

    This is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
to be able to request when you want it. What Apple has done is given the
buyer a CHOICE between configurations and not an OPTION.

>Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
>system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system

    This is not unclear at all. In fact Apple has included in the ROMs
of those machines with LC040s code to recognize the presence of the full
040's FPU and use it. Thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
chips. You pop the LC040 out and pop in a full '040.

    They did? I think I would double-check this. It has been stated
countless times in this newsgroup by two of the Centris hardware
designers that the LC040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
the C610 can be upgraded to a full '040.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

Battery powered devices like the PowerBook are sometimes more sensitive to 
serial port weirdness.  I had trouble with connecting my Mac Plus to an HP 95LX
handheld.  Everything else worked okay on that port, but not the HP. (it runs
on two penlite batteries).  It turned out that the plus (by accident or by 
design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
weird things to the HP (which has only 3v dc!).  The HP worked fine when 
connected to the printer port.  

Does your PB screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  Have you 
tried using the printer port?

Good luck.

Have you tried the library?
Since you go to WPI (so do I), go to AK and look on the first floor, a

is around 10 pages long.  I'm sure the library has the info you request, It's

The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I don't
know about the newer PowerBooks, but I kind of doubt it.  I got bit by
this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer CD
before I found this out.

Terry, hi.  I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E.  I can't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.

I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
lines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.

I have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
equipment :

Check for warrany tape.  If none, carefully open unit.

Inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.

Clean up these manufacturing mistakes.

*Now* power up the unit and check it out.

I can't think of how many things I've bought that weren't okay right out of
the box due to sloppy QC.

if you have a memory card installed that's not one of apple's, this

Subject: built-in video problems on Mac IIsi !!??!!
Organization: Physics Department, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands

Dear Mac-friends,

I've seen the following problem om three Mac IIsi machines
all with 17 Mb RAM installed (70 or 80 ns SIMMs).

If the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
on the screen.  The lines translate to the top of the screen and
have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they
are a few millimeters apart).
I admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,
especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.
Applications which produce this effect are:
- the previewer of DirectTeX 1.2 (i.e. DVIReader 1.2)
- Kaleidagraph 2.1.1/FPU

The machines use their built-in video and drive the old 
Apple Hires Monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  
The effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
panels: Memory (adressing mode, disk cache) 
        and Monitors (nr of greys/colors).

Have you ever seen this effect too ?   Is there a solution ?

Thanks,
Fred

Can some people with cache cards PLEASE post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. I have only one report, which seems to indicate that
a 32K cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! Access to memory takes
LONGER when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32K may be worth $0. I don't know what kind of numbers 64K cards get
you. Also I found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the Mac IIsi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

So is $99 a good deal or not, I still don't know.

Hi folks

I'm planning to buy a LCIII but need advice on choosing a monitor.
What do people recommend for a decent 14""/15"" monitor?  

I'v looked at some ads and the spec for NEC 4FG/4FGe and the price is 
within my budget, but could LCIII be able to use the various resolutions 
available on 4FG (specifically the 1024x768 resolution)? Does LCIII only 
support one resolution?

Also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for LCIII or
monitors? Does anyone have experience with the following mail-order places?

	SYEX EXPRESS 	(Houston, Tx)
	USA FLEX 	(Bloomingdale, Il)

Thanks,

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:
 
Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16"" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
 
I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.
 
My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

I believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. Since there is no
error #64, then I would guess that it would be a -64 error. Which is a font
manager error of ""error during font declairation"".

I would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start
up on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that.

Hi,

I have been told by a local sales that Asante has come out with this
LCIII PDS Ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
My question is will the FPU performance degrade will I put the 68882
on the PDS card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? Intuitively,
the math co-processor should always be placed close to the CPU, but
I am not sure how good Apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
it comes to throughout. Does anyone know the answer to this or have
any experience with the Asante LCIII Ethernet adapter? Thanks in advance.

I'm assuming that the cabling tells the Mac, at startup, what kind of
monitor is connected.  Now I think I've seen ads in popular Mac
magazines for products (I'm not sure if it's just a monitor, just a
video card, or a package of both) that allow you to change resolutions
on the fly (w/o restarting the Mac).

If you were to buy a 1304, would it be possible to switch back and
forth between Apple 640x480 and Apple 832x624 without restarting the
Mac?  Is this strictly a hardware startup function, or can software
intervene, or does the Mac hardware occasionally probe the cable
setting and switch automatically?

Thanks,

Ravi,

	Its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
vertical position.  If the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
I'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
why take that chance?  If you want more detailed info on the problem, please

Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  Is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only ROM chips from used machines?  I know that
copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used ROM.  (After all, reselling a used computer

Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would

Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my

Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be
truncated. I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. 

I'm using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my
IIsi - when things worked perfectly.

We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1.

Apple UK adopted their usual ""friendly"" approach and told us to call our
local dealer - God help us !!

Any ideas ??

I guess the real question is:

Who asked the original questions, and why was it so _broad_.
Are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing BTW)
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system?  
Or are we shopping for a home computer based on the CPU specs (yuck)!

I just finished a project that involves real-time processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has
_a lot_ to do with the ""power"" of a CPU in a particular application.
If what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given,
then not only is it easy, but it's cheap and quick.  If you have to
fake things (like resolving indirection without a LEA instruction), then
your cycle count goes through the roof!

well, let's _NOT_ start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.
The orginal question was about classifying micro-processors...
having re-read the entire thread, I don't think much more can be said without
getting down into specific proposed systems with important details given.


That's it for another $0.02.

a page and the cells have a visible border, the last (bottom of page)
line on the first page will be missing. It makes no difference how
the table is formatted. The worst is that it doesn't show up in word's

Question for those familiar with Quadra VRAM:

I put 2 256K VRAM SIMMs in my Quadra 700 (in the 2 slots closest to the
RAM SIMM slots) and I got no results whatsoever.  I have been told that
the built-in video should support at least 16bit and maybe 24bit color on
a Macintosh Color Display.  However, the Monitors control panel still
lists 8bit (256 colors) as the highest possible.

Does it make any difference which slots you put the SIMMs in?
Do you have to do something to activate them?
Do you have to do something to the Monitors control panel?

BTW, I am running System 7.1 with 8 Megs of RAM.

It's my understanding that, when you format a magneto-optical disc, (1) the
formatting software installs a driver on the disc, (2) if you insert the
disc in a different drive, then this driver is loaded into the computer's
memory and then controls the drive, and (3) if this driver is incompatible
with the drive, then the disc can not be mounted and/or properly read/written
Is that correct?

		3) Daystar ComboCache IIsi
		4) LogiCache IIsi 64k cache

I'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.
The other alternative is to upgrade to a CPU accelerator such as the

To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and
blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
devices can ""hiccup"" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle
of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager
will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
pay attention to the errors coming back.

Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but
rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when
the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte
hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus
error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

 I just thought I would pass along my experience with APS. I recently ordered
 an external Quantum 240. The salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the
 order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. 

 Installing the drive was simple; I didn't even have to read the manual. The
 SCSI address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. I daisy-chained the drive
 from my Syquest (also from APS) and booted up with no problems. 

 I'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. It's a
 pretty good assortment.

 The drive/fan is a bit noisier than I would like, but I think it'll be OK.
 The speed seems very good, although I haven't run any objective tests. It
 also seems to spin up pretty quickly; I can hit the power switch for it, and
 almost immediately power the Mac without any problems booting from the drive.

 Some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older
 Syquest case is metal. There is one LED, which is normally green, and
 flickers red as the drive is accessed.

 Just a data point,
 Rich

Those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during System startup.

One thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose. Next time you power down the computer, check that all cables are on tight.

In the last two weeks I have the following problem on two 160's

1 has a 8Mb Simm and the other a 6 Mb simm
Both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed
by different people. 

Both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the
Memory Chimes.  Crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  In
both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it
back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my
marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger SIMMS are
""lopsided"" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the
keyboard or something?  

Anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - If somehow you
could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.

I've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8Mb simm with a
2Mbsimm -although this is NOT desireble solution.

Please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.

According to MacWeek of 2-22-93:

The Cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the Quadra
800, while the Tempest will share the low-slung case of the Centris
610. Apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents. Taking advantage of the 32-bit
digital signal processor (DSP) built into the systems' logic boards,
the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,
with 256 gray levels, on the screen.

Users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. The camera
is expected to cost between $150 and $250.

The systems will ship with all the software needed to put Apple's
Casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have
to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.

The two models will talk as well as listen. A new system facility
called the Speech Manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.

The Cyclone will include a 40MHz '040, three NuBus slots and support
for up to 128MB of RAM. The Tempest will use a 25MHz LC040, lacking an
FPU, and hold up to 68MB of RAM; it will have a single slot that will
require a NuBus adapter and have room for only 7-inch NuBus cards.
Users will be able to update the Tempest's process but not the
Cyclone's.

For more get the 02.22.93 issue of MacWeek.

Actually, the Quadra 900 and 950 both have the same SCSI controller,            (running at different speed).  They are not SCSI 2, but can support
certain SCSI commands that take advantage of faster drives.  The
I/O processors are present on both machines.  The Q950 runs its
I/O bus at 25MHz, while the 900's I/O bus is 16MHz.

The Quadra 950 supports 16bit color on all monitor sizes, as well
as 24bit up to 832 x 624 resolution.  It also supports 1024 x768
resolution.  The 900 supports supports 8bit at 1152 x 870, and
does not support 1024 x 768 at all.

VRAM on the 950 is 80ns or faster, and 100ns or faster on the 900.

NuBus is a much more robust system for system for installing multiple
cards without configuration problems.  I know that when I was checking
into expasion options for an SI there were a number of PDS video cards
that would not work with certian Dual slot cache adapters.

Hi everyone,
I just had a quick question.
Does anyone know whether or not the MacIIvx supports the new SCSI-2 form, or 
do any Macs support it.
Thanks for reading,

I have a question for y'all:

I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5"" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis
in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions
in IBM PC magazines)

Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,
but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,
*max*.

How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it
had to have a DTR of 10megs a second?

(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.
I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
at 5megs a second!)

Thank you.

Summary: Instructions for Quadra 700 memory installation
Keywords: memory,quadra,700,install

This is turning into a FAQ


Here is how to violate your Quadra 700 warranty and install your own
memory.

1)  Insert usual disclaimer here
 
2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back
	of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM
    slots.

9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to
    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their
	chips facing the front of the motherboard.
	
    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in
	sets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely
	and firmly into a fully upright position.
	
10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

12) Replace the phillips head screw

13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount

this is a bad idea. my machine is on 24 hours a day, but it's actually 
_doing_ things 24 hours a day. i use it as an all purpose alarm clock, 
scheduler, i've got routines that run in the middle of the night, phone 
calls it makes during the day when i'm out. if your machine is _on_ 24 hours 
a day, then you can count on it to be _working_ 24 hours a day. i could call 
it from work and download a file that i might need, i could call it from 
work and have it turn the lights on if i'm going to be late (oops, more 
wasted electricity -- but conversely, i could have it turn the lights 
_off_). heck, i suppose i could even connect the microwave and have dinner 
ready when i get there.

oh well. nevermind. i'm just babbling.

The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reason
to get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep 
in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.
This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unless
you're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off the
LCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for most
people and has a great price.

If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.
16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.

   Huh?  Where did you get this idea from?  I think you got this
backwards.  The Duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). I think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
cycles I believe).  Things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the FPU (which the Duo
doesn't have undocked).  Extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too.  Real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen
depth you are running etc.

Espen

PS!  The Duo is 32-bit through-out.

NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu
Summary: Results of IIsi clock modification poll
Keywords: IIsi,clock,poll

This poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
IIsi clock oscillator. I have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk. The number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24
machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
This is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.

Thanks to all who contributed to this poll. 


Issues:

	Speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
		add on cards. All reported machines were able to use
		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. Several Apple
		Nubus cards were in use. No machine with the Nubus adapter
		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. One wasn't even able to
		achieve 25 mhz with the Nubus adapter in place
	
		At speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and
		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.
		
		Note: Unless specifically listed below, machines were not
			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. Hence,
			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
			higher speeds.
			
	Damage) One user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. This was
		repaired and the machine is operational. One other
		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
		during desoldering. There is one second hand report of a user
		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.
		
		No reports of static discharge damage.
		
		No reports of high speed operation causing damage.
		
		Then again, I also don't have any reports from users of
		defective parachutes.
		
	Add on boards) Compatibility appears to be a problem with Apple Nubus
		Adapters. Several other add on boards have been used with
		success. See case histories
		
	Heat Sinks) Virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
		These were often the TO-220 style power transistor type. Some
		used epoxy. Some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
		of cyanoacrylate glue. There was also use of a clamp with a
		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
		
		
		
Case Histories:	

All speeds are the effective CPU speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). All reported
CPU versions were 20 mhz.

1)  27.5 mhz operational. Ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.
    No FPU or other add on card

    No floppy problems
    No damage during installation
   
3)  27.5 mhz operational. Unable to boot at 31 mhz

Not Quite the point to be considdered here!
Fact: If/When Apple release system 7 (or what ever is current at the time 
of release) then you will see shortly afterwards Apple no longer producing 
Hardware...Look at Next with their NextStep486 to see what happens.
Who is going to pay Apples Prices when they can get the same thing cheaper 
else where! (Heck we can get a Sun Workstation cheaper than a Quadra, and 
infact we have a number of times!!!, it ALL comes down to $$$$)

No the continued develeopment is because there is becomming less and less 
profit in Hardware, So the Next Step (no pun intended...well sort of), is 
to make the money in software (look at Microsoft if you think it can't 
happen!), after all you can sell multiple pieces of software to ONE 
hardware platform.

As you also said Windows is a nightmare for programmers, so will the 
temptation to sell system 7 to a couple of MILLION dos users be too much 
for Apple! (50 million copies @ $100 is SERIOUS money!).

I remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external

. . I was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  My
PLI 80M syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the
outside of the case.  Where do I connect this switch??  Can the computer just
""tell"" with internal drives?  
	I noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (I
didn't look closely, but I seem to recall it laying over the ram that's
soldered onto the motherboard?  Would that cause problems?
	One last question!  Is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?  
the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the
drive's panel is the same size as the spotsBM clone's cases).  Should I just
cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?

Here's the scoop:

For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and
a Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now 
using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who
is planning on getting an Apple 14"" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My
question is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he
purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?

Thanks in advance,
Derek

I'm a system and network admin. One of my users has a Duo 230
([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.
Leaving the Duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
unacceptably. It can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. During
this time it is completely hung.  If he reboots, the problem goes away
(For a while). It seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
configuration.

He's re-installed System 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. Neither of these
have helped. 

It's possible that it's network-related, he uses Eudora which checks his
email every 10 minutes (over Ethernet). He hasn't checked to see if this
problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). 

Little to no non-Apple inits, I don't want to start yanking the rest
unless I know that might *really* be the problem. 

He hasn't tried zapping the PRAM, I have advised him to do that next.

Anyone who has ideas, I'd love to hear about them. I'd call Apple, but
I've found they're best to call during the week (it's Sunday evening).

I recently bought a PLI 21mgbyte floptical drive, and I was very happy 
with it until I tried to use it to format a 1.4 HD diskette. I put the
HD floppy in my Superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it
correctly, and now my Superdrive refuses to recognize ANY floppy (it says
""this disk is unreadable"" and asks if I want to format it) even original
systems floppies from Apple. Nor will it format the disks if I try to
(""initialization failed!"")  Strangely enough the floptical still reads
both the 21 MB and 1.4 HD disks, but I cant look at my 800k floppies, and
if I have a crash I'm screwed because the Floptical can't be used as a
start-up disk.  PLI has been unresponsive.  Any ideas? Has this happened
to anyone before? I was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and
now I am looking at an expensive repair.  Help! respond to this thread, or

Are you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  I've seen this sort 
of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an INIT 
conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
hardware.  Have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
Q950 just sit there in the Finder?  You might also want to try changing to 
24-bit addressing (yes, I know you can't access your full 64 MB of RAM - 
it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
then.

Another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
QuickKeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  This reprograms (some 
of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.

From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less
Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations
that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx!

And a Mac IIfx (68030 @ 40MHz + FPU) is _the_ fastest 030-based Mac.

Take note, of course, that benchmarks never tell the whole story... Get your
favorite program(s) and run them on both machines at the store.  They should
let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount...

Anyone out there have a Sony 1304S?

I have one, and it's very nice, however - If I run it in 16"" mode, the
picture won't
go very big. I end up with about 1"" gap either side, and .5"" top &
bottom. I suspect
an internal adjustment would fix this. Anyone tried it?

Another problem is sub-brightness: Areas that are meant to be black (or
off the main
raster) are not very black. The real raster is quite visible when the
screen is blanked.
This is not too severe, but it is just not as good as other Trini screens
I have
used. If I turn the brightness/contrast down so that the raster is not
visible, the
real image virtually disappears!

The raster size is just right if I use 1024*768, but 100dpi+ is a bit too
much!

Oh, and I am using a RasterOps 24XLi card.

Sorry, this must be a FAQ, but it's a quick fix that I need to take care of  
before a demo in less than 24 hours from now! Couldn't think of a better place  
for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware.

I need to connect the Serial A of a Compac 386/20 PC to the printer port of a  
Mac IIci. Does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would  
allow this connection? 

The serial port on the Compaq is a MALE DB9. How would this map to the DIN8 of  
the Mac serial? I tried one of those really short femaleDB9-maleDIN8 cables  
that Apple sold as adaptors to plug in Macintosh serial peripherals from the  
pre-MacPlus era. This cable didn't do it. Do I need a null modem adaptor as  
well on the DB9 side of things? 

I just need to be able to map the data TX and RX pins correctly.


thanks kindly,

Hello!

I have a SE/30 and a Generation Systems 8bit PDS card for a 17""

It worked great until I upgraded from 5 to 20 mb ram.
Now with Sys7.1 and MODE32 or 32enabler it does not boot..

a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit
fixes.

BUT: when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor
goes black after having been grey) the system  SOMETIMES boots properly!!
and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics.

WHAT's HAPPENING???

Thanks a lot for any advice!!!

Well,

    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds
of computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.
Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed
I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
designed the software.
    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I
have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.
The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.
   
I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
just crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you
haven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED
with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.

I have the same problem and was about to post this....

Hello duo owners (and Apple technical people :-)
 
I have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
sleep when running on battery power. When woken (usually for the second
time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
the machine. The problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
(no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
etc). I have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to AC.
I've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
 
What's going on here ? Anyone else had this problem ? Is it software or
hardware ? 
 
If you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
behaviour (and let Apple know too !).
 
Many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.
 
Bruce

Hello Net.People,

We have a LaserWriter Select 310 (standard 1.5Mb RAM) connected to an LC
III (4/80).

The print driver cannot find any Adobe Type 1 fonts or any TrueType fonts
in the System.

The connections to the printer and the Driver installation are correct
but this 310 printer still refuses to find fonts and work correctly out
of the box.

IMHO, an Apple product not working out of the box is a shameful event.

The installer disks for the printer install: LW Select 310 driver v 1.0,
PrintMonitor v 7.1 and backgrounder v 3.1 (!) on a System 7.1 LC III.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with this printer/configuration,
because we really need some help on this one.

Thanks,
Anthony    anthony@medicine.adelaide.edu.au

    You must not have tried very hard. I just opend mine in about 2
seconds. Take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open
much like the older ADB mouses used to have. It's a bit harder to turn
at first but it is quite simple to open.

    Well, if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some
problems. A close look at the socket should give you an idea of the
proper orientation of the chip.

    Nope. The Apple 16"" monitor does not support multiple resolutions.

Don't be silly.

Using the Sound Manager on a Quadra is very well, but using SM on
any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the CPU. This is
a fact. By writing directly to the hardware on an SE, it is
possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11kHz) for
a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. Exactly how would you do that using
the SM, pray tell?

The correct thing to do is to use the SM on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the SM means, and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. It's not the
politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of
view it is.

I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossi
at Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those who
purchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no
greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For those
who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
or greyscale (at 300dpi).

If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
hardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance 
1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).

Regards,

Glenn

P.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  They
really have an obligation to provide this information to all
of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for
things like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed, 
I'm going to write Apple and complain.

The screws are Torx screws and the tool isn't to hard to find. It's a
matter of finding one with a long enough shaft to do the trick. 
 
No it is not a good idea to take that fan out.  Why because it will
cause stuff to over heat.  Internal hard drives, motherboard...You name
it and this can cause damage.  I've known people to have hard drive
failures because of fans that didn't work right....

Okay, I don't use it very much, but I would like for it to keep working
correctly, at least as long as Apple continues to make System software
that will run on it, if slowly :-)

Here is the problem:  When the screen is tilted too far back, vertical
lines appear on the screen.  They are every 10 pixels or so, and seem
to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.
It looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection
between the screen and the rest of the computer.

I am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,
or taking this one to the shop.  I would also like to not have
to buy one of Larry Pina's books.  I like Larry, but I'm not sure
I feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
for it.

On a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?

According to what I saw in a store today, the Performa 405 is not the same

Correct me if I am wrong, because it is possible that the dealer may have

Dealers who sell the Performa are known to have about as much knowledge

Does GX take the place of 32 bit QD or add to it? Right now 32 bit is

where you have to cast CGrafPorts to GrafPorts and such. It would be a

Applied Engineering makes a NuBus card called the QuadraLink which is

In a resent article in one of the macMags I think a 50mHz 030 accelerator was
 slightly slower than a 25mHz 040 accel. But, this is using a system designed
 for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie
 quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.
    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system
 at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the
 speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060. I think
 it laps the pentium.

I think you must be talking about the Syquest 105 (code named Mesa I believe).
It is a 3.5"" Winchester technology drive pretty much like the other Syquest
drives in terms of how it works. According to the latest MacLeak, the 
drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures
are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
performance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC
and just recently was released for the Mac world (don't ask me what the 
differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
to a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
I have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak
including PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse's PowerUser. The PLI
and MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
are going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold 
105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges
are cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.
Cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli
drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
reliable.  Personally, I'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
getting my hands on one.

Here's the story:

(1)  The IIsi *cannot* supply a VGA output.  However...

(2) Some VGA-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the Mac uses to drive the Apple 13 or 14 inch ""high resolution color
display""---i.e., Apple's own 640x480 mode.

So, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your IIsi, you
need (a) an adapter that converts from the Mac DB-15 connector to the
VGA-style high density DB-15 connector, *but* tells the Mac to use
it's own 640x480 mode, not the VGA 640x480 mode, and (b) a VGA monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the Mac 640x480 mode over
the VGA 640x480 mode (which as I stated in (1) above, the IIsi cannot
produce).

As far as (a) above is concerned, contact

 James Engineering, Inc.
 6329 Fairmount Ave.
 El Cerrito, CA  94530
 510-525-7350
 FAX: 510-525-5740

They can probably get you the right adapter.  Remember: you do *not*
want the run-of-the-mill Mac-to-VGA adapter, because it will try to
have your IIsi produce the VGA mode, which it cannot (the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  Instead, you want
an adapter that connects between the Mac-style and VGA-style
connectors, but tells the Mac to use the Apple 640x480 mode.  Sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.

As far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 KHz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 Hz.  These are the spec's of Apple's 640x480 mode.  For comparison,
the VGA-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 KHz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 Hz. vertical retrace rate.

The monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as
the Apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
in the PC compatible world.

Good luck!

I had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago.  Resoldering
the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  Turns out
that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)
cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video
circuitry off.  If you're not a solder-jockey you might want to
have someone else do it -- I took mine to an electrical engineer
buddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops.

The CPUs
 Note: I am only showing Motorola & Intel CPUs used in Mac and most IBM/PC 
clone machines. For example, since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and 
68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed. Years only appear with dead CPUs 
and indicate first to last year used as a CPU.
Cache note:  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs. These external 
caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it.  In most of 
the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are 
optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since 
there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk 
and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and 
they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller 
{cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to 
128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.
Note:  ALU is industry's de-facto standard for CPU bit classification.

**68000 Mac designs created a 4MB limit.
***The 040 has 2 clocks, an internal processor clock [PCLK] that is 2x freq of 
external bus clock [BCLK] which is the one used to rate the chips 
(Bradley Lamont; Motorola 68040 data book).  Some compilers produce programs 
sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
chip, but this very compiler and program dependent.  Compliers maybe written 
to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the 
future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 
040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, 
and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.
*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).

As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them 
separately to eliminate redundancy.  They are Motorola CPU RISC chips.

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th 
ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020 
and above.

<=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it 
down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}

286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The 
hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X. 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 
286 ~ 68020 comparison.}

386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0 
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for 
apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.  
The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
comparative to 386sxs.}

486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU.  Only with programs sensitive to  
PCLK & pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2 - FPU or a '486dx2sx'.}

486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in FPU, MMU, 8K 
internal cache (which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in 
the 486).  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK & pipelining does the 68040 
behave like a 486dx2.}

Pentium   ~ 68060 {Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat 
problems.  These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 
4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 
12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium
(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} 

PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, 
Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later 
Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in 
a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}

Hardware 
{In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating 
systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software 
developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}
Color Support/Display
 Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 
32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y 
independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 
dpi [12"" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including 
autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz 
vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser 
Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and 
IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit 
color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit 
color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX 
will change this.
In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures.
VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of 
 built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit
 color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. 
Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE/30.

IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like 
Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver 
and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, 
and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 
486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 
and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster 
processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD 
ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  
MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter
 original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.
CGA: Color Graphics Array
 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.
EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array
 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions 
 could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.
VGA:  Video Graphics Array*
 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are 
 the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a 
 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock
 (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals
 from EGA/CGA etc. 
MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*
 subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA 
 and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  
 Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.
SVGA:  Super VGA*
 This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch 
 all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things
 are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 
 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, 
 some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually 
 at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital 
 Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], 
 some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 
 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 64K ""window"", etc.
Other non-SVGA standards: 
8514/a:
 IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
 like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations 
 from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do 
 not have interlacing. 
TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some
 do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.
XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array
 newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones 
 are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at 
 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.
XGA-2
 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area
 fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-
 exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth 
 isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
 companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh 
 rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.
*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.

Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software
 drivers.  ""Fast SCSI-1"" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode
 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are
 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and
 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can
 use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such
 is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called ""fast SCSI-1"". 
 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics
 but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a
 different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.
Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2
 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port 
 interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some
 Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.
IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with 
 systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.
 Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers
 out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.

Mac
Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 
 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx 
 used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 
 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every
 memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.
 Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris 
 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).
Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.
Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. 
PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, 
 Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  
 Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: 
 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with
 the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in 
 IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows 
 through put down.
NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,
 and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:
 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and 
 Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a 
 Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet 
 to DMA.
NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:
 ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7"" instead of the 
 old 12"".
QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's 
 VLBus - ""Architecture is identical to that of VLBus"" (Byte 10/92:128).
 Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.
CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  
 Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at 
 the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.

IBM
Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-
like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.

HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: 
MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited
 only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.
IDE:  Integrated Device Electronics 
 Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.
 currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
 drives. Can have more than one hard drive. 
ESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface
 ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in
 many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of
 hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. 

BUS interfaces
{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working 
with old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}
ISA
 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a
 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).
 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,
 hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards
 aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}
 while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's
 showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit
 (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  
MCA {Micro Channel}
 IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; ""allows use of more than one CPU in a computer"" 
 (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components 
 involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA 
 and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).
EISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}
 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to 
 self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable 
 interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.
VESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}
 Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}
 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus 
 mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for 
 video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of
 their patents (Mel Martinez).
QuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture
 (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines
 (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.
PCI
 Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace 
 ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.

OSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]
and multiple application use.}
Mac
512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows 
Apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, 
menu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require 
clone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires 
access to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM 
chips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support 
interface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS 
has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
therefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control 
over hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with 
some of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a 
totally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon 
Wtte).
6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, 
 cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  
 Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program 
 interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of 
 AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a 
 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as 
 real RAM is below 8MB.
6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.
6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.
7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard 
 to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present 
 non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on
 system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking 
 within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing 
 can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be 
 accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, 
 Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable 
 IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType 
 support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present 
 machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is 
 both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit 
 mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last 
 'free' OS.
7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than 
 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode 
 on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. 
 Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades
 {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.
 [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system 
 fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any 
 RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all 
 fonts from the system file.]
A/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and 
 a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS 
 is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac 
 ROMs.  Price: $709.
Note: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats 
including the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and 
DCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' 
and AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most 
still play.

IBM
 Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for 
programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  
Since hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, 
what little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  
This results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or 
EPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
is harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it 
reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
support is needed.
Side note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing 
all feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing 
its Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (""Undocumented Windows"") and 
""There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to 
abort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present"" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 
#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC 
judicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no 
action.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of 
choosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has 
turned down Microsoft's copyright of ""Windows"" which would allow it to charge 
a fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).
MicroSoft OSes
DOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier 
 with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program 
 must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS 
 Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit 
 Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in
 DOS 4.0.
DOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk 
 defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for 
 networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} 
 (Byte April 1993:44-46).
DOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).
Window 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to 
 deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to
 run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the
 equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].
 This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac
 programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and
 still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed
 is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).
 Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS
 counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).
Window 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base 
 requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. 
 Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).
Windows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  
 Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 
 with built-in peer to peer networking support.
Windows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the 
 swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in 
 the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the 
 reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM 
 but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).
 This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric 
 multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in
 networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even
 though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor
 is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993
 (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993
 (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495
 (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).
Other OSes
PC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS 
 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).
DR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} 
 and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later 
 version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple 
 file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).
OS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,
 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, 
 multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file 
 to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. 
 IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this 
 (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).
AIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.
NeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final 
 version to be out by May 25, 1993.
Solaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric 
 multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with 
 tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and 
 communication package.  Client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users
 server: $5,995.  Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.
Mac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel 
 Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM 
 (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run 
 on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps 
 will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to 
 Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow 
 progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in 
 late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}

PowerPC
Rumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; 
MacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA 
video (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week 
3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.
Apple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and 
to have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to 
sale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser 
9/92:146)}
(MacWeek 3/22/93).
PowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on
 PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain
 (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard
 drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.
 Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.
Pink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) 
 and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and 
 PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).
Windows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.
Solaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the
 Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state 
 that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details
NeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.

OS Number Crunching (Mel Park)
Mac
 Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard 
Apple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
FPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
representation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment 
of 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and 
the FPU programmed directly.

IBM
 Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when 
emulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
compiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers 
exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS 
prompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this 
better.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, 
Windows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.

Networking [Includes printing]
WYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially 
if one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.
Mac
Hardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
LocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for 
each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in 
Ethernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at 
about $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and 
transceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.
The Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet 
interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a 
network option since 1989.
Software: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can 
use variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS 
as well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, 
Banyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing 
machines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows 
typical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version 
will have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 
(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC 
Pathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software 
built-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. 
Printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
the chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
chooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.
Printing bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.
 {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}

IBM  
Hardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.
Software: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk 
protocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.
Each of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
with the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
that product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more 
forgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, 
{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
offers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more 
complex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac 
finder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
InfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)
Printing {Very OS dependent}
DOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
 and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
 software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
 implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
 software program to the next.
Windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing ""jobs"" 
 in the print queue, but it always lists printers as ""active""... even if they 
 are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
 on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
 which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like 
 and intelligent about this.
OS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.
Printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do 
not have WYSIWYG printing.  This is the fault of the programs in question and 
not that of the OS involved.

Price issue: This is very dynamic with Mac providing more build-in features 
than IBM and IBM being more 'get only what you need' then Mac and price wars 
by both worlds.
The IBM machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
standarization, which in turn requires OSes and programs to be very complex to 
handle ALL the variation in hardware.  When one adds all the standard Mac 
hardware features to an IBM {built-in input/output sound support, SCSI, PDS,  
built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
NuBus 90 in higher machines} the Mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
equipted IBM machine {Especially since some IBM monitors can be used with Macs 
which cuts some more of the Mac's cost (MacUser Aug 1992:158-176)}.
 Some prices using some of the info in this sheet and MacUser April 1993.
All Macs below come with a PDS slot, VRAM, and SCSI-1 built in.  Except where 
noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card 
needed except for 24-bit color display}.
IBM planned a $1,200 386SLC/25MHz model with a 60MB hard drive and color VGA 
monitor {~VRAM} (MacWeek 8/17/92) {sounds like a Color Classic without SCSI-1, 
sound support, built-in network support, FPU socket, built-in expansion to 
16-bit color, etc}.
Color Classic:  $1,389 - 030/16MHz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20MHz 
equivalent}, 4/80, FPU socket, and built-in monitor.
LCIII: $1,499 - 030/25MHz {~386dx/33MHz equivalent}, and 4/160.
Centris 610: $2,899 - 68LC040/20MHz {Depending on the program ~486sx/40 or 
~'486dx2sx'/20[40]MHz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i CD-ROM, a 
PDS/NuBus 90 slot and VRAM for 16-bit color.
Centris 650: 040/25MHz {Depending on the program ~486dx/50 MHz or 486dx2/50 
MHz equivalent} with a PDS and 3 NuBus 90 slots. $3,189 {ethernet, 8/80}; 
$3,559 {ethernet, 8/230}; $3,999 {ethernet, 8/230, CD-ROM, VRAM for 16-bit 
color}

How many NuBus slots do you have?

Applied Engineering has something called the QuadraLink, which is
a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms
toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) It also comes with
software for fooling applications to open an AE port when they
think they open a built-in port.

They also have a more expensive card with DMA (better performance)
and I _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles
8 ports simultaneously.

As I said, with NuBus, you're green. Learn how to use the Comms
Resource Manager to get at the various installed cards.

Cheers,

This happens intermittently to Macs in our department, ranging from IIsi's
to a Quadra 950.

I can end the slowdown immediately by unplugging the Ethernet cable from
the Mac. It seems that something on the network puts out these packet
storms every few days. These storms have the effect of making our Macs
slow down to a crawl.

Hi there!

I wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good NuBus display
card for driving a 14"" multisync (NEC 3D)?
The NEC 3D can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 kHz to 38 kHz and
vertical from 50 Hz to 90 Hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,
though I am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624
noninterlaced.
It would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
8bits/pixel, preferably more.

Is there anything on the market that comes even close?


Thanks

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen
them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx
so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.

(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive...)

NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there
is no problem building an expansion box.

The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface
with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work
together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that:
here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with
this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You
may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2
video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra 
electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so
guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?

So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

    Sears is probably going to have the best price around, most of the

    Not really. The newer Peformas (405, 430, 450) come with what is
really a third party monitor that Apple has put their name on and
called it the Performa Plus display. Essentially it is a VGA monitor,
quite cheap.

Nope.  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)
and receives all my faxes.

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat
than I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've
got one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working.

By the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time.

The problem mentioned last is a known Quadra SCSI problem, it was heavily
discussed last year and an Apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the SCSI driver routine for the Quadra's (at least the
700
and 900).  System 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the 
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  In my
case MASS Microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
Quadra
700, all that occured early last year.

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Well, although this may be an uncommon occurrence (or not) I had a ""bad""
experience with TechWorks.  This past summer I upgraded (increased) the memory in
a powerbook and a ci.   When I called to place the order for the PB RAM, I was
told by the sales person that they would give me a $50 rebate if I would return
the original RAM (which was also TechWorks RAM.)  I followed the instructions for
returning the old RAM, expecting to see a credit on my VISA within a few weeks.

Well, months went by, and no credit.  After many calls (almost none of which were
ever returned - arghhh) I finally found someone who told me ""Why we never
received your old chips.""  I then explained I the procedure that I had
followed to return them, to which the person replied ""You mean you sent them
US Mail?"" (which I had, per the original sales person's instructions.)  I was
told that they their loss of US mail shipments is not uncommon (come on) and that
I should have sent the stuff via FedEx, etc.  I reasoned that I had done exactly
what I had been told to, but they would not budge, the people I spoke with were
absolutely no help.  I sent letters, copies of the original receipts, attempted
to trace the package through the US mail, made *many* more phone calls to
TechWorks, all to no avail (I wouldn't give-up because I was so disgusted.)
Sales/support people, supervisors, there was nothing I could do to pursuade them
to ""make it right.""

I finally (in total disgust) wrote a letter to my credit card company, asking
them to investigate the problem.   Three weeks later, the credit miraculously
appeared on my statement.  I have not (in recent memory) been so disgusted with
the service that I received from a company.  In all fairness, they had no way of
knowing that was not trying to rip them off, but I went to *such* great lengths
to prove to them that this really happened.  Oh well, c'est la vie.  I will never

me to RACK MOUNT my 2CI (or maybe 650 if I blow some more
money...) ??? My application is music, and would like to be
able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an MO drive
or something so I don't have to depend on an internal fixed
hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal HD...)

I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area, if that matters.
Also, anyone have any info on 650's and Midi? And, would anyone
care to email me with the price they paid for their 650? Or if
there's a price list FAQ, never mind... Just curious about the
difference between the best retailers and the local university
pricing...

  OOPS - got home and re-checked and found out that it
ISNT the Radius Video Vision which was mentioned as having
problems.  None the less, I still have a chance to buy one
relatively cheap - can anyone say how well it seems to work,
and if there has been a newer model introduced (accounting
for the price reduction?)

That seems about right.  I have a Mac IIsi 5/130 with 64k cache card running
System 7.1.  My roommate has a 486sx/25 5/200+ running Windows 3.1 and from
what I've seen, my IIsi is faster in some operations.  In others, they are

I have no experience with this particular hardware, but
just about every month in Macworld there is an add for
an combined SE accelerator/Video board.  This item sells
for about $1000 and comes with a 25MHz 68030/68882 pair,
eight SIMM slots, and a grayscale 21"" monitor.

This accelerator plugs into the SE's lone expansion port
and thus no soldering.  You will however, need a long
TORX wrench to get the case open (but that's not really
a big deal).

Does that sound like what you were looking for?

    It isn't Apple's responsibility to tell its customers how to fool
around with it's hardware. That is what Apple Service Techs get paid to
do. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple for
coming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all of
those drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, except
for those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with you
about the LW Pro design.

    Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certified
service people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buy
it. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don't
get upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is no
longer valid.

    This sounds like the kind of problem I had when I installed 4MB
SIMMs into an LC, back before low-profile 4MB SIMMs were readily
available. The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case and
make it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work just
fine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they are
generally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.

Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-based
Rocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare and
the minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,
NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.

Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- except
perhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPC
slot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPC
accelerators.

One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it will
need a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, with
Rocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.

Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macs
will have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISC
and that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those in
existing 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreaking
prices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seen
much cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.

First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketed
CPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.
This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulled
for clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (which
I doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to do
this, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, as
standard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area where
Apple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchup
is in order.

By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,
Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessor
front for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.
Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and all
the other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminent
right now.

Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's market
position will never again be as dominant as it is today (especially
if AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears it
might). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesome
battle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while not
guaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one of
several.

  Actually, an accelerator such as the Daystar 33 MHz 68040 is cheaper than
upgrading to a Q700 (25 MHz).  The accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  However the Q700
upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21""
with 8 bit depth and up to 16"" at 24 bit depth (with additional VRAM).  It
also has a SCSI port capable of a much faster throughput than the CI, which
makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.

  If the improved video and SCSI features are important to you, you're
better off getting the Q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
accelerator.

A friend is heavily into MIDI and is using a Quadra 900 (maybe 950) with

what he needs to see.  He also reports that the built-in video is even
worse.  He's not a Mac guru, and I haven't seen the system, so this is

I suspect that his NuBus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might

        I am currently managing, among many other labs, a lab with three 
LC IIs, a Mac Plus with 45 MB external HD, and a LaserWriter II NTX. My 
problem? The LC IIs seem to intermittently slow to a snail's pace.
        These LC IIs have 4 MB RAM, 256K VRAM, and a Quantum LP105S HD 
installed. I have reformatted the drive with Hard Disk Toolkit 1.3, and 
it gives a very respectable 2.9 overall rating to this drive, so it's not 
the drive. I have reinstalled System 7.1, MS-Word 5.1a, MS-Works 3.0, and 
so on, all from the master disks. In short, I have done everything I can 
think of in software. I am *not* a hardware hacker, though I pop cases 
fairly often. But nothing works.
        The problem is intermittent and unpredictable. The mouse always 
moves smoothly, floppies always run at the same speed, but occasionally, 
for about 1-2 hours at a time, a machine will run like it was running on 
a 4 MHz 68000, not a 16 MHz 68030. It is VERY frustrating and makes it 
nearly unusable. It does seem to worsen with increasing disk activity.
        Has anyone encountered this problem before? Has anyone got any 
ideas? They would be much appreciated.

Ben,

Since you're obviously adept enough to understand how the trackball works,
the only thing short of repairing it that I can think of is a thorough
cleaning of all the parts, and then checking for the proper placement of
the little blue rollers. Since they aren't fixed in position on their
stainless steel pins, you might try sliding them into a slightly different
position. On my PowerBook 100, I can slide them almost completely out of
contact with the trackball. In fact, one of the notes from sumex on fixing
the trackball advocates sliding the roller so that its _edge_ contacts the
ball, not the center cylindrical area.

I've done this with my PB100, and it does seem to improve the feel, but
needs to be adjusted from time to time. I just popped open one of our
office's PB170s, and while there isn't as much latitude for movement, one
could still adjust the roller slightly. If your PB140 is the same it might
help.

I would suspect the most likely culprit to be a slippery blue roller. If
you can take it out, clean it with a mild soapy solution, or isopropyl 
alcohol. Also, be sure the ball is grease-free.

If you drop the ball in minus the retaining ring, roll the ball and see
if it is actually causing the axle to spin. 

If all this still doesn't solve it, then maybe a new one is in order. :-(
It could be an electrical connection, in which case replacement would be
necessary. But my experience with both mice and trackballs has been that
dirt has been the normal problem, not an electrical malfunction.

Hope this helps,

Murray

I have had my Q700 running with a 66.666 MHz osc for a few months. I have a
number of SCSI devices connected (Quantum LP52, Maxtor 213, Toshiba MK156F via
Emulex adapter, Pioneer DRM-600) and have had no trouble.

I am using the stock cooling facilities, I considered adding a fan/heat pump,
but don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). I have a temp meter on

Try looking at the Brainstorm Accelerator for the Plus.  I believe it is
the best solution because of the performance and price.  Why spend $800
upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
  The brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  It speeds up the internal
clock speed to 16MHz.  That may not seem like much but it also speeds up
SCSI transfers.  I think that feature is unique to brainstorm.
Check it out.

I'd give you the address of Alberta Computer cable in Calgary, but a: I'm

You shouldn't have ignored the ZyXEL.  It can be purchased with a ""Mac
bundle"", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and FaxSTF software.
The bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending
on the supplier.  It is true that the modem has no Mac-specific docs,
but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &D0 in the
init string, to enable hardware handshaking).

For more information on the ZyXEL, including sources, look at various files 
on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.

   My mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when I use it.
It means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad

   I checked my monitor, it works fine with other Mac.
   I checked my video card, it's also fine.
   I replaced all the RAMs, it still didn't give me right answer.
   Hence I assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.

Hi everyone. Just the other day, I ordered a VRAM chip for my new LCIII from
Mac Connection. They sent it overnight (very nice) and I got it installed,
and we found that it didn't work properly. When you put the computer in 
thousands mode, the bottom of the screen (using the new chip) is all flickering
and fuzzy. So I called them up and I'm going to return it for a new one.

My question is, how often does such a thing happen with SIMM chips in general?
Do you often find when ordering chips that a large portion are bad? Is this
a rarity? This is the first chip I've ordered so I have no other experience
in this area. I'm just curious if anyone else has had the same type of
experience.

That's about it. Please email me, and if people want, I can post a summary.
Thanks all.

Hi,
I'm having problems tying to get a Sony DAT drive to work.  I'm using
Retrospect 1.3Ci,
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a Mac IIci,
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department.
  Ideally, we want to attach it to our Quadra 950 setup.  I can't seem to
get the
Retrospect software to recognize the media at all.  When in the ""Devices""
dialog,
it can see the DAT device, but comes up with, firstly, 'Running', secondly
'Media Failure' and then immediately 'Contents Unknown'.  This does not
happen with the
Mac IIci setup, which simply says 'Ready'.
  I'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution... I 
know some others who have had problems with DAT devices and their Quadra,
but they have
a Mac IIci which they can use!
  
THE SYMPTOMS
System software is 7.1, also didn't
work with 7.0.1
  I have tried the following:
  Turn off all extensions, except Retrospect SCSI (required)
  Tested on a variety of machines:  Quadra, IIsi, and LC (at least).
  Connected no other SCSI devices
  Tested all varieties of SCSI termination etc.
  Replaced the DAT unit with a new one (Yes!  we got that desperate!)
  Read the Retrospect manual (EVEN MORE DESPERATE :))

Replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. 
I'll post any
solutions to this group.

Cheers,
Matt.

So is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally?

I got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). However, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
places I can think of to place it, so I would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

This is probably not a ""newer"" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
when I bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). So is my old, 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?

Just curious.....

060 fastest, then Pentium, with the first versions of the PowerPC

No.  Computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
Memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
I/O speed.  As processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  If
you have a 50MHz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
every 20ns.  Sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns SIMMs.

And roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
speed as is the 68030.

I would really like to get one of the new CD300i CDROM

when they will be available.  He doesn't even have a part
number yet.   Does anyone know what the part number 
for this drive is and when it will be available?

My Apple dealer suggested I buy one of the CD300 external

I'm not going to use.

My 610 is working like a charm.. In fact, if 610's are flaky, I would consider it a great computer even if I had to return a couple to Apple to get a good one.

Subject: Disappointed by La Cie
Organization: Univ of Miami IR
Lines: 52

Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for
$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there were
intermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining
5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.

Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.
Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if I
then insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart the
IIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given me
another RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't see
the drive there's a definite hardware problem.

Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to send
me a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchased
my original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.

I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. And
I understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of these
facts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above that
when I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for data
recovery.)

It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (still
covered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. 

I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame La
Cie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.
But c'mon. Sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way. (I sent
a letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and I
asked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even 
have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)

What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy any
other products from La Cie in the future.

Bill Krauthammer
f2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu

PS Please don't email or post about how good your La Cie product and service
has been. I'm not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like
that. All I'm saying is that I've had a disappointing experience with them and
I'll be taking my business elsewhere in the future.

Apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor
design that does just that.  It was announced along with the new

in the buildings where I work, gigawatts are wasted by unused, always-on

Thicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on the

	Performa 200 == Classic II
	Performa 400 == LC II
	Performa 4xx == LC III
	Performa 600 == well, nothing :)

	The Performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  The 4xx have
bundled software, modems, etc.
	Because they have no ""retail price"" you might be able to get a steeper
discount on them.  Shop around.

	As far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  Much cheaper.

Okay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.

The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to
make sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values
into all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was
because
of how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by
scanning
this block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on
some machines).

When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to
generate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had
once
documented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""I
want to
play a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted
the
documentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers
of
sound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you
want
to make stereo sound.

Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from
the
IBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game
writers to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.

Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output
hardware,
and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase
works.
On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase
gets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra
700/900/950
at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel
only.
Both are technically correct interpretations of the original
specification,
but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.

If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono
sounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the
underlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left
channel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their
games will only come out the left on some games.

The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound
on the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.
It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of
the different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which
are actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what
machine
you have.

Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:
>Lemmings
>Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
>Glider 4.0
>OIDS
and also
Hellcats,
Super Tetris
Oxyd
(and many more, these are just what I've tested)

Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.


Other games you list:
>Armor Alley
>Spectre
>Spaceward Ho!
and also
PGA Tour Golf
Civilization
(and more, these are again only from personal experience)

Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.

The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!
Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to
do,
but I'm going say it anyway.
Stop cheating on sound!
Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers
will be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period
is about to end.
The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon, so use it.

In conclusion:
To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.
To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send
sound
to both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of
automatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all
hardware.


Have fun.

Disclaimer number 1:
I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.
So don't write me with sound questions.

Disclaimer number 2:
If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is about
to end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not
allowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.

This doesn't sound right to me.  Don't Quadras use the 53C96?  If so, the
Mac has nothing to do with the SCSI timing.  That's all handled by the
chip.  About the only the timing could be wrong is if Apple programs the
clock registers wrong on the 96.  That, however, should only really hurt
synchronous transfer, which is not used by the Mac SCSI Manager.

Furthermore, disabling blind writes should be meaningless on a Quadra.
On Macs that used the 5380, which is a much lower level SCSI chip, the
Mac was responsible for the handshake of each byte transferred.  Blind
mode affected how the Mac handled that handshake.  On the 5396, the
handshake is entirely handled by the chip.

    Not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. The C610
isn't like the IIsi was, meaning that the motherboard of the C610 is 
actually designeds to run at the speed of the CPU, and not designed to
run at a higher speed (like 25MHz) but be forced to run at the speed of
a slower CPU (20MHz).

    There is more than one oscillator. If you are talking about the CPU
oscillator chip, I think that it is located under the socket for the
'040. At least this is what I have read in some other posts in this

I have the a CD-Technology drive with the Toshiba mechanism, and it is
supposedly the fast and best now.  It has an access of 200ms and a data
transfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It is
available from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with two
mail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, since
I've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shipped
to my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  The
CD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,
which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan to
attract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think the
CD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightly
lower price with two free CDs.

The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time I
think, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of the
three mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the apple
catalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photo
cd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some of
which are pretty good.

The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms and
a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around
$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatible
before, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners of
the older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd's
unless you buy it in a bundle.

Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be the
Apple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it's
compatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it's
speed and performance. 

BTW, the models of the drives are:

Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)

CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but it
is also something like with 3401)

NEC:  CDR-74


I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problems
whatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I am
pretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.

Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name as
the president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,
my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu is
just a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with the
enormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california has
three Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school and
lives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.

monitor with a centris (hence title).  

    The answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  You can use any
old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a
Mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
machines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.

    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.
 The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my
1604s).

THen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  I would
advocate calling James engineering because they seem to have a clue.  As
to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling Apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
    APPLE WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A F**KING ASSANINE IDIOT FOR EVEN
CONSIDERING GOING THIRD PARTY AND IF YOU WANT THIS TREATMENT WANTS YOU
TO PAY FOR THEIR THECH SUPPORT LINE (the supposedly compitantly one) AND
THEN STILL HAS NO FU***** CLUE.

personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
doesn't see to extend to Macs (Sony, Magnavox).  In addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits
(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. ""well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this $5,  9"" ""super smelly sock"" monitor that will let you
display TWO FULL PAGES side by side.  All you need is our reasonably
priced ""oder eater"" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of SIX fast kilohertz and three Khz
vertical."")



Note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible.  Using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.

                                                                    -A.

No.  I recently bought an LC II with a 14"" monitor.  The monitor comes with
the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
most larger Macs.  Since the LC II doesn't have one of these outlets, there
was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
the monitor.  But it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  It's
not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the
most.

Hi, there!
I have a MAC LC and consider buying CD300. I've been told,
however, that:
1. The double speed of CD300 is achievable only on machines
   with SCSI-2.
2. The double speed is a prerequisite for PhotoCD multisession
   capability, which I need.
3. Which means I seem to gain nothing compared with, say CD150.

Any comments?

A professor of mine once said ""The difference between a Computer Engineer and
a Computer Scientist is about $5000"" meaning the Engineer makes $5000 more than
the CS.
Seriously though the main difference is that most CS people write programs that
people will use, i.e. database, graphics, word processors, etc., while an
engineer writes for machines or control systems, i.e. the ""computer"" in your
car, a flight control system, computer controled devices, etc. In other words
CS writes SOFTWARE while CSE writes FIRMWARE. 
These are generalizations but for the most part that is what the difference is.

P.S. The $5000 is not just a joke

	Well here is my $0.02 worth.  Advice from a grad student.

	I agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
The important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and 
learn as much as possible about it.  

	In my five years of education in this field, though brief 
compare to alot of people, I had to think about this kind of 
question a lot.  Did I make the right decision in going into
Electrical Engineering as opposed to Computer engineering or
CS?  The more I go thru school, the more I believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.  
 
	I have come to believe that choosing CS because one 
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something.  Everything
is interwoven and inseparable.  CS, CE, and EE are all a 
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

	My advice is don't limit yourself, but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to 
learn.  That of course depends on the curriculum at your 
persective school.  I would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible.  Beside, I don't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her/his
sophamore year.                  

	Hey you may be so interested in this field that you 
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which 
case, you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

	About the money.  Don't look at the averages, if you
are good, you are going to earn more money than anyone else. 
If you are a superstar programmer, you will earn millions.  
Like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

It is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in any
macintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that came
with a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in
another 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.
 
First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum
quarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them
was stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a
problem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for
over two months.

The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal
hard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just
splice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard
connector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare
cable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found
in any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly
soldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of
shorts or bad connections.

Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk
ribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what
I did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another
male connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,
and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a
crimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not
damaged, and I can go back to the original setup.

Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for
power consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this
day. 

In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of
the drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are
intact. I did not try this without the terminating resistors but it
seemed logical that if I am splitting the SCSI chain, that the signal
should be terminated at all the ends.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

There's absolutely no reason why differences in the DRAM access time 
_alone_ would cause an incompatibility.  There would have to be another 
difference between the SIMMs for there to be a problem.  I've often used 
memory of different speeds with no problems whatsoever.  As long as it's
as fast (or faster) than the minimum requirement you should be fine.

Just out of curiosity, did you actually try this and see a problem, or 
were you told it wouldn't work and so never tried it?  Also out of 
curiosity, do you know exactly who in Cupertino you dealer talked to (as 
I'd like to find out what they're basing this recommendation on).

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute/TCP made by
Compatable Systems ($1400).  This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac).  It will
route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks.  Software routers are also
available for less money, but I'm not sure if they work with TCP/IP.

Are there any graphics cards for the SE/30 that also have, say, an 040
accelerator?  There seem to be plenty of accelerator/graphics cards for
the _SE_, but none (that I've seen) for the SE/30.

Frankly, I think this model is a screwup.  It does not have PostScriptlevel
2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or
grayshare.  Even the 300 model has this!  I am shocked by the kind of
features you get for this printer.  I myself was hoping for some decent
printer to replace the Personal Laser Writers.

Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160M harddrive 
configuration.  When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M
harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space 
would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-
uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and 
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  

Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a
several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files 
with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like 
os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are 
pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a 
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though
I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my 
computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to 
because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, 
softPC or trying any unix os!)

When Apple came with their demos to Iowa State, I got a chance to run
Speedometer3.1 on some of the new Macs.  Both machines were running
System7.1, had a 14"" RGB.  Don't know what the caches were set to.
Neither machine had an FPU  It appears that the Centris610 is quite a
bit faster than the LC III:

		Centris610		LCIII

CPU		13.01			6.92
Graf		15.67			7.69
Disk		2.22			2.44
Math		25.57			10.19

P.R. Rating	12.91			6.58

So, there is a comparison.  There is definitely a very noticable speed
difference between these two machines according to Speedometer3.1.

Get your facts straight before you post something like this.  The Duo

ports connecting various components, including the portable PowerBook
with its own CPU.  I guess these rumored new Duo Docks have a built-in
CPU to perform functions of their own.  Interesting!  If they're not
compatible with the current Duo models, I think you'll be hearing a

If you write a second time to a CD you need to have multi-session capability to
read the second session.  Whether it is photos or just data or whatever.

Here is a simplified way of looking at it:
The first session has the directory structure burned at some tracks.  The
second session has a newer directory structure, but the first directory still
exists, because you cannot change, only add.  So if you put that in a 'normal'
drive and it will only look to the first directory and think it has found all
data.  Multisession kindof means that the drive will look for the last
directory written to the disc, older systems look only for 'the' directory, not
taking multiple directories into account.

I think you are suffering from some alignment or color
table or <whatever> problems, if a Color Classic is as fast
as a Quadra rendering to screen.

What screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
video is almost always faster than NuBus)

Or you measured ""scroll entire screen"" where the Color Classic
had a VRAM 10"" screen in 4-bit color and the Quadra had a
21"" 24-bit screen on NuBus :-)

The previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns SIMMs in
a 50MHz machine, but that you could use 80ns SIMMs in slower machines. I just
pointed out that if you could only use 20ns SIMMs in a 50MHz machine, you can't
use 80ns SIMMs in anything faster than a 12.5 MHz machine. Bank switching and
caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
access).

the Q700 will only do 8bit or 24bit color.  if you want the higher

for a 21"" monitor, you can get 8bit max.

In the May issue of C't Magazine was an article about upgrading 040 models
of apple. They simply change crystals and add a fan.
Hammerhead: Centris 610 was able to work with 25 MHz (cooler prefered)
            and for 1000 DM you get an 68040 (33MHz) which works with the
            appropriate crystal at full speed. (extra cooling required)    
            Centris 650 like Quadra 700 with extra cooling 33MHz works on
            most machines and for real power enthusiasts they used a
            Quadra 950 at 40 MHz wow! But for better description you should

I can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. Some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes. Basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. This
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive's long-term reliability and MTBF ratings.

I first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. Some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are NOT
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.

Hope this helps.

 I know of several NuBus frame-grabber boards but wonder if there
 might be similar ones for the lesser Macs (those without slots),
 something permitting instant freezing of a video picture (PAL) 
 and feeding it in without jaggies to a simple digitizer like 
 MacVision (which takes 22 secs to scan a picture, so a frame
 grabber is a necessity). 

 The objective is 512*342 1bit/ pixel (B/W) pictures stored in
 HyperCard... have tried using top-quality VCR with freeze-frame
 function but the screens come out full of streaks and garbage.

Is there a fix for this? We have a Quadra 900 that will NOT finish startup
unless there is a monitor connected. This would be no problem, but since
we're running it as a file server, there is no need to have a monitor
connected all the time.

Some kind soul told me that I could change the serial port buffer size
of Zterm via ResEdit. He did not tell me HOW I could change it using
ResEdit, and I have lost his e-mail address.

Could he or any one else please tell me what to do?

I assume that the relevant resource is zSet, but I do not know, and
I have no template for that resource. If you have a TMPL for the correct
resource, I would be grateful to receive it. That way, I could play around
a bit and maybe get my Duo to do something useful with its serial port.
(other than Appletalk).

BTW, I believe that when the port stats says that maximum in buffer is
3074 bytes, that that means increasing the buffer will help, if you are
using hardware handshaking. I can cram text data pretty fast into my Duo,
and can monitor that CTS is being lowered, but the buffer never gets beyond
3074 (out of 4096) bytes. Makes sense to me.

To use the grayscale features, I believe you need a Mac equipped

not mentioned in ""Apple Facts"" (guide for apple sellers), in the

Re: Methods for attaching heat sink to processor.

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. It comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At
Radio Shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  It's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it's
tacky.

Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then
bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your Mac, gravity
and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
things in place.  Just make sure you remember it's in there, in case
you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  You
wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .

Hi everyone,
      I'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing
on the HP Deskwriter (Sys 7.1, Deskwriter driver 3.1, PowerBook 170).
When I print from, say, MS Word, I see the message ""Spooling to disk,""
but sometimes nothing prints. Checking my memory map thanks to Now Menus,
I see that HP Backgrounder has not loaded. Restarting fixes this. It
seems to me that HP Backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its
status as ""Multifinder NOT aware"" allows it to do this without my being
informed by a message such as ""HP Backgrounder quit unexpectedly."" Have
you ever seen this problem before.
        There may or may not be a related problem. I have experienced
problems in putting my computer to sleep. Choosing ""sleep"" from the
Finder menu sometimes does nothing. Today on a whim I checked the memory
map, and I discovered that HP backgrounder was not loaded. Restarted
reloaded HP backgrounder, and I was able to put my machine to sleep as
usual. Just a mere coincidence or is the HP backgrounder crash preventing
my machine from going to sleep?
	Has anyone seen this problem? I'm seriously considering the purchase of
a StylewriterII because of the poor quality of the HP software. 

	Please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.
	Yours truly,
	Marc Bizer

Hi,

The subject line says it all.  My system acts weird at times.  All of a
sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.

This was a really big problem for a while.  I couldn't even format my
drive properly.  I installed HDT's driver and things got better.  Now
all I have to do is reinstall the system.  Could an incompatibility 
exist between it and a Quantum external drive.

I'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  It's not a virus, bad
software, etc.  Could I have a bad SCSI cable?  Or is the IBM (WDS-80)
just a screwey drive?

Thanks,

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a
shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and
rotational speed. This utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives.

I wish I caught the original post, but anyway ...


The problem is that the Plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board) is on its way out. Apart from a board swap (bikkies to
Apple), there's not much the average Joe can do to fix it.

You can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should
be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a
temporary fix. A copy of Larry Pina's ""Macntosh Repair & Upgrade Secrets"" is a
worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.

Larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent
bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput.  They also
have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and
reduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)

If you get the Centris 650 with CD configuration, you are getting a Mac with
a 68RC040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  My 
understanding is that the ""optional fpu"" refers to your option of purchasing
the Centris 650 4/80 without FPU OR one of the other configurations WITH FPU.

Apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-FPU system to become an FPU
system.  And, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-FPU system
(a 68LC040) can be replaced with a 68RC040 supplied by another vendor.
Apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the Centris 610, which ONLY
comes with a non-FPU 68LC040 processor CANNOT be upgraded to support an FPU -
the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
swap one for another (again, according to Apple's memo).

Hope that helps.

  I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color 
is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the
original manuals.

The only way to do that would be to add a video card to the LC expansion

[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications

using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  

Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.

>Needless to say, I'm interested in purchasing such a ROM.  What would
>be a reasonably price to offer?

Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.

If you use System 7, you can use my application Zing which has
a 30 kB footprint (meaning you can have it running all the time
without losing memory)

It is also compatible with the chat program ""FishBomb"" which allows
sounds and pictures as well.

Both are, as far as I know, freeware (I dustribute Zing with source)
and should be available on the normal services (mac.archive.umich.edu
for instance)

As far as I can remember, all you need to do to get your Deskwriter up and
printing using the 3.1 driver is to drag the driver itself (either serial or
appletalk depending on your needs) to the system folder. You don't need the
fonts or anything else if all you want is straight forward, bare bones, basic

Its a small box, which has a bag inn it , seemingly

The installation instructions are most informative and say, in full,

SO what does this do ? At first I thought it might be a NT to NTX

REPOST - DUE TO NET PROBLEMS

Hi,
   I have problems with the FDHD on a IICX that EKG reports is ROM
revision 376. I had reports that this Mac was having trouble 
formatting disks and by the time I got to it, the FDHD just would
not respond although all other functions were fine.

I checked the voltages on the DB19 external drive connector and pin
6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. The power 
supply is an Astec and I sent it away for repair.

With the power supply reinstalled, I now get the following error:

With the internal FDHD connected, the Mac boots fine but on completion
of boot cycle an alert displays ""The disk is unreadable - do you
want to eject it?"". For every combination of response, the alert 
reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. The
FDHD does spin but there is no head seeking and the FDHD is incapable
of ejecting the disk. This error sequence occurs regardless of whether
there is a floppy in the drive or not. Pin 6 on the DB19 external 
connector shows 1.2V, pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

With the internal FDHD disconnected, the Mac boots fine and works great 
(MacEKG reports no errors). The DB19 external connector now shows
no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75V.

Now, the internal FDHD may be fubar, but I have an apple 800K external
drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when
connected to either the external DB19 or the internal connector at J16
(after suitable surgery to the external drive). The voltages at J16 
(with the internal FDHD disconnected) are as follows:

	PIN	Volts	PIN	Volts
	1	-	2	5
	3	-	4	5
	5	-	6	5
	7	-	8	-
	9	-	10	5
	11	-	12	-
	13	10.75	14	5
	15	10.75	16	5
	17	10.75	18	-
	19	10.75	20	5

This machine has a SWIM which I don't think EKG tests. I have tested all
diodes and pica fuses and can find no problems. Does anybody have any
ideas ?

                        Best wishes,

I currently use an HP DeskJet with Grappler LS ver 1.0, 
and it works on System7.  Course, I only use the SWA Dutch
and SWA Swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size
requirement to print to the HP. (ie: must have 40pnt definition
to print a 10pnt font)  When I upgraded,  I talked to Orange
Micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of Grappler LS definitely
works with System7.  However, the upgrade was US$40, so I
passed.

Hope this helps?

I bought a Bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
 diffrent storage solutions,
OPTICAL drives are SLOW, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of Bernoulli.

Since I needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev
e disk), I choosed Bernoulli drive. I use Adobe Preimere and Quicktime movies
alot. you ran out of storage real fast.

IMHO, the best buy currently is the Bernoulli 150Multidisk. 150MB per cartridge

Lines: 21

Jeff,
  I have answers to both of your questions.  First, I recommend the Sony
CPD-1320 monitor.  It is a 14"" Trinitron VGA monitor, but it is designed
specifically for use with the LC.  It works only with Macs with specific video
capabilities which means only the LC's and anything after the ci.  All it
takes is a MAC<->VGA cable (I recommend one from James Engineering which is
about $20).  These cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  I have used one for half
a year and I love it.  
Second, I have used Syex and found them to be decent.  I had a backorder on a
Supra modem which I cancelled.  They were helpful in explaining the reasons
why there were delays and they had Supra's number ready for me.  The only
complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
I have been told that the CPD-1320 is selling for $339 from J&R's
(800)221-8180.  I think Syex is a little more, but I don't know.

I have looked at the Radius Color Pivot. This can be bought for

the older model not the new T-16 II. How about the Super Mac 17T?
These both can be had for a little over $1000. Any others??

I had mention in a previous article that I was searching for the 300 external

were back ordered until May 8.  I placed an order anyways and two days later
I had a visit from Federal Express.  Well, you can guess how I spent my weekend.
Of course I ended up paying list price but you do get a free copy of PC Exchange
when you order from the Apple Catalog.  You may want to check if they have any
internal drives.

BTW, an older version of GateKeeper (I don't recall which version), hung up my
Mac when trying to access a photoCD or audio disk.  I got the newer version
which did mention a conflict with the Apple 4.xx CD driver.

I've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is NOT a

Yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, I was prepared
for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my C610 8/230/CD in 5 weeks).
I guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
specs and documentation.  The case load spec is an example -- the setup
section says Apple 14"" and 16"" monitors can go on top, but 21"" and other
big ones can't.  Why couldn't they publish a maximum load?

Now if I can figure out if there's any hope using the ""partition"" button
on the hard disk setup utility (do I dare just try it and see what happens?),
then maybe I can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
securly.  The ""getting more information"" section of the manual suggested
trying other avenues before calling Apple, but didn't mention the net.

It must be... ...I type it with my left hand.  Personally, I would have

I don't know about the Instrutech boards (though I plan to check them out),
but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and S/N ratio of
many of the ""16 bit"" boards out there. The NI boards are very clearly
specified in terms of monotonicity, S/N ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
NB-A2100 and NB-A2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. This is
not true for the Spectral Innovations boards, for example.

I think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. I found that on the
original ADB mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
easier cleaning.

If the original poster has his answer, I'll ask: How do you open the
new ergonomic mouse? By open, I mean split the two halves to get at
the guts. It isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look I spent
with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
heads.

and NO COPROCESSOR (well, actually it's a 68LC040 instead of a 68RC040,
'just had to say that to keep people from saying ""there is no such thing
as an '040 without a coprocessor, since the FPU is built into the chip"")

OK, there ya have it, but if I were you, I would wait untill the cyclones

I have an SE/30 with a 80 meg HD which dates back to April 1989.  When I
originally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This
was fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.

Lately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is
powered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given
the ""no disk to boot from"" icon.  However, upon turing the
computer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  
Furthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot 
button the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power
off and on always works.

This problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before
it often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.

Does anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how
it can be fixed?

I'm wondering if it's getting old and requires more time to 
""come up to speed"" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that
allows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before 
trying to access the HD?

Thanks!

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting
on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the
heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. 

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived
here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast.

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used. I'd be happy

I think you will find that the Mac SE can PRINT grayscale images, loaded
with the proper software. However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on
its screen or any attached video because that ability is not in the ROM.

So, while you might be able to PRINT grayscale, you'd have a hard time
SEEING the grayscale image you want to print.

A rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so
they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that
they have been having lots of problems with their Centris 610.
He didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.
It sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine.

He's not recommending the Centris 610 to anybody; he says to
consider a Centris 650 or a IIvx. (Why he would recommend a
IIvx over an LCIII I don't know, but that's what he said.)

So, what does the net think? Did the dealer just get one flaky
machine, or did Apple send the C610 out the door too early?
Is your C610 working just great, or is it buggy too?

There is one reason: market size.

The market size for color quickdraw for accellerated plusses and
SEs (which don't go beyond 4 MB anyway) is just too small; the
extra cost would belike $1,000 and with that money, you can buy a
color classic instead.

	The computer itself uses far less electricity than a TV. 
Monitor--depends on the size :).

	But one thing NOT to do is use a self-shutdown or power-shutdown

You need to add two 256K VRAM SIMMs;  512K VRAM SIMMs will not work in any 
of the Quadra or Centris machines.  There is already 512K of VRAM soldered 
to the logic board.  You add the two 256K SIMMs to this to give you a

Subject: When you're not using it, turn it off!

Research has shown that the majority of the time that the United
States' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on, they are not
actively being used.  In addition, 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

Computer equipment is now the fastest growing private-sector use
of electricity.  Computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption, and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

If you are one of those who leave them on after you're done, it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just TURN IT OFF
when you're not using it.  It only takes a second or two to do.

Also, the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself, but by the monitor.  If you can't turn the
computer off, then please just TURN OFF THE MONITOR.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy-
efficient PCs that ""power down"" automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation.  These
new computers will save enough electricity to power both Vermont and
New Hampshire and save up to 1 billion U.S. dollars in annual
electricity bills.  Look for the special EPA ""Energy Star"" logo when
you buy computers.  They should be available in one to two years.

According to the EPA studies, the energy saved will prevent CO2
emissions of 20 million tons annually, the equivalent of five million
automobiles.  Also, 140,000 tons of SO2 and 75,000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved; these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain.

Please do your part ... be responsible.  If you're not using it,
then just TURN IT OFF.

their 50lb 16"" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no coment
beyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to 
thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weight
would be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the 
base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.
So I cut a piece of 3/8"" thick wood to about 16.25"" x 12"", covered it in a 
cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's top

The si has a single expansion slot, that can be either PDS or Nubus, but not
both together. The card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & HD and
requires an adaptor slot to do this. There are Nubus and PDS adaptort cards.
Thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you
have. With the exception of the Radius rocket, all NuBus cards I know of work
in the si. PDS slots and thus cards are Mac specific, thus not all PDS cards
work in all Macs.

My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well.  Works

out.  Zoom is out of the question from what I'm hearing.  AT&T has a great 
product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too.

If you want to receive a fax, your computer will have to be on, but not 
the monitor and of course the modem.  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software.  
It's entirely up to you how to arrange that.  I've had faxes sent to me 
which is great but I've been home to set it.  I don't have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day.  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about $70.  Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 
you need.

Hey everybody:

   I want to buy a mac and I want to get a good price...who doesn't?  So,
could anyone out there who has found a really good deal on a Centris 650
send me the price.  I don't want to know where, unless it is mail order or

I'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system.

What I would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
their quality and performance.

My preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and
1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity.

So far, I only know a bit about the Iomega floptical and the Infinity
floptical drives.  Are there any comments/recommendations for either of these?

Are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc).

Thanks in advance.

Summary: sync problems on multiple boards
Nntp-Posting-Host: merlin.cvs.rochester.edu
Organization: University of Rochester, Rochester NY
Lines: 61

We are having a problem with a Quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor, as well as us :-)
This Quadra is 'stuffed' with 64Mb RAM, 2Mb VRAM and some large disk (400Mb
I think). What happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. It is quite apparent that the
Mac CPU is still ok, and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry, since you can still save your documents, quit your aplpications,
even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy, so it's
pretty hard to hit menu items ;-)
We had the original logic board replaced twice now, and the same problem
has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has
varied. The first board had this problem every about 1hr, more often if the
cache was turned OFF (yes OFF).  This is the only symptom that is not
obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the CPU
right?). The second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did
not keep it, rather we put the original back), the current board we have
has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it,
but did it twice within an hour yesterday).
The technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty
sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway). These included:
-swapping the RAM
-swapping the VRAM
-swapping monitors (3 different 13"" Apple RGB and 2 16"" Apple RGB)
-swapping cables
-disconnecting HD and booting from floppy
-sacrificing various small mammals
Here are some other facts:
-when we put a RasterOps ProColor 32 on the NuBus, the problem is fixed
 (it does not occur with the internal video or the ProColor video out)
-the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards
 that exhibit it in our lab
-Apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards
 that they cannot find anything wrong with, and getting them shipped back as
 faulty according to us.
Here are some speculations:
-I bet that neither Apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that
 much RAM and VRAM on them simultaneaously, which may have something to do
 with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can
 reproduce it with just 4Mb of RAM, so this is probably a red herring).
-the vendor's representative blames 'metal in your walls' - claims that our
 walls have metal in them which interferes with the Mac's operation. We
 have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it's not in
 the exact same spot....) Please don't tell me this is probably it, I do
 not want to believe it.
-it's probably not poltergeists, since they do not have badges to get past
 security at the entrance to our site.

Has anyone any ideas? Please? Please email as well as posting cause I seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less
time available to read news! :-)

    Ah... Ok. I didn't realize that you were talking about an Apple
division other than AppleUS. AppleUS, being the main division, is the
one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and
configurations for the majority of Apple customers, and it is generally
assumed that you are talking about AppleUS when you just say Apple. At
least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. All other Apple
divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if
they feel like it. I know that Apple Canada does this kind of stuff all
the time. It's not a mistake, it's Apple Sweden giving a different name
to an Apple product other than what AppleUS calls it.

	I just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
some grayscale pictures for my kids, when I discovered that
grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are
using an SE...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.
You won't see this in the printer's docs, and the Apple
rep didn't mention it to our users group either. It seems
that SE ROMs won't support those ""features"". Okay, I 
guess I should have somehow known that this was the case.
Let the buyer beware, huh Apple?
	Be that as it may, I have been thinking about the 
problem and I'm puzzled. Why  can't a defencieny in the 
ROM be made up for in software. I write software for a living

can't be done"" responses I've gotten from those I have
asked so far.  Isn't Mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-

	Anyway, I was hoping someone knowledgeable
about Mac internals could set me straight: is it simply
impossible for a mac SE to print grayscale, or could
someone armed with enough info and a little pro-
gramming experience cook something up that would
supplement the ROM's capabilities?
	Also, how does one know if one's mac can
support the grayscale and photograde that the Select 300
is supposedly capable of? ( Short of buying the printer
and trying it out like I did)

Not a good idea to compare processor power. Doesn't make sense for real

At least for x86 systems doubling the clock speed increases performance

So what's the deal with the PDS slot in the IIsi?

I recently purchased a Mac IIsi.  I want to add a non-Apple monitor to the
system.  I was told that you could buy a 90 degree angled PDS to NuBus adaptor
card so you can fit a standard NuBus card into the computer.

Am I mistaken or do have to buy a PDS monitor card specifically for the IIsi?
I've seen the PDS monitor cards for the si, but they seem expensive, and I'm
not exactly made of money.

Any ideas?  Help.  Clue me in!

Nec Toshiba and Sony (Apple) nearly deliver the same speed.

You should buy what is inexpencive. But think of Driver revisions.

I've had my Duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
of the above problems. I reinstalled my system software twice
in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
system software problems. Initially reinstalling the system
seemed to help but not anymore. Occasionally when I try to
wake up the Duo I get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
the screen - it freezes.

I also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
startup.

I've called the apple hotline (800 SOS-APPL) three times
already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
Duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
itselft and put itself to sleep. This problem only occured
twice. Apple sent me a box to ship my Duo to be looked at in
New York but the problem now is intermittent and I can't
afford to be without my Duo at this time.

Anyone out there with these same problems?

Just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. Top three
contenders seem to be AT&T Paradyne, ZyXEL, and US Robotics. ZyXEL has the
biggest ""cult following"", and can be had for under $300, but I ignored it
because I need something with Mac software, which will work without any
tweaking.

The AT&T Dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. They are
backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
effect until May. Its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
modems. WARNING: AT&T ads say that the modem comes with a Mac kit (cables &
all), and has lifetime warranty. This applies *only* when you order
directly from Paradyne! I called ElekTek (one of the distributors), and
they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...

USR Sportster for the Mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
it's only $250 from ClubMac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
and don't care about the FAXstf software, you can get the generic model
from PC outlets for $190.

All this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
Motorola Codex...  :-(    I ended up ordering the Dataport; we'll see how
it works in two weeks or so.

However, I know for a fact from seeing the Cyclone Data Spec sheets myself,
don't ask, Macintosh Cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
NuBUS standard.

Very interesting possibilities indeed!

Thanks for the enlightening post.  Is there a Technical Note on this?

The desktop machine I was referring to was actually not a Mac,
but rather, any of various workstations that use the
68030@25MHz, such as old Suns or old NeXTs.  I used to own a NeXT
68030 cube.   

But I will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference I get with my powerbook Duo. I did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a Mac Plus after
installing system 7 on it.  Why does the OS suck up so much CPU
power? 

Also, you're right--software does make a HUGE difference.  I
have the misfortune of using MS-Works on my Duo.  When editing
relatively small (40K) files, cut or copy takes several
seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  This happens with power
cycling turned off.  As usual, MS software is maggot-infested
feces. 
I'm getting Nisus to replace it for my text editing.

Hello,

I saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as I could tell no
answer appeared on the net. What is the good oil on connecting the Apple
Extended Keyboard to a PowerBook? The earlier questioner wonderd if this would
be too much of a load for the PB and as I want to connect just such a beast I
am curious.

I haven't got a PB yet so I can't RTFM but I assume that a standard keyboard
with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet I read mentioned connecting an
external keyboard. But is the Extended plus mouse pushing it?

Any help gratefully recieved. I will summarise to the net if necessary.

Thanks, John Collins.

P.S. I am thinking of a PB160 but I assume that this would apply to all PB's.

Shure it is temperature dependent, but this does not clean all your
problems.
Based on some exp. I must say that the connections between the power supply
and the Monitor and Main Board are usable to this failure, Ram simms can be
badly connected due to some corrosion and the powersupply can be in the
last
phase (lower Voltage).

So you can do following if you are used to such technical terms.
1) Clean all mentioned contacts with contact spray
2) readjust the 5 Volt level of your powersupply
3) use a calm fan and think of preventing dust blowinÔ through the floppy!
   (a fixed piece of paper can prevent this)
if you don't know how to do it beg a friendly technician!

Apple does not authorise sales through Mail Order.  As a result mail order
companies have to obtain their machines by the grey market.

This market is supplied with machines from authorised resellers who have
more machines than they can sell.  They come into this state of affairs
by overordering either accidentally or deliberatly to get a better
wholsale price from Apple.  In either case they often obscure the serial
nunber to protect their identity.  As a result the warranty is void.

You may save on sales tax but you have to pay for shipping.

I should also point out that mail order companies cannot get lower prices
thatn the high volume authorised dealers unless they buy below dealer
cost.  As a result the only way they can sell cheaper is by cutting costs
and trimming margins.  Unfortunatly they dont seem to be doing too well. 
The lowest prices I have been quoted mailorder do not beat the lowest
prices available from authorised local dealers.

They are even further away from educational prices.

Flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25

I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
the next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a few
different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
speeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed when
I want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience any
compatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be able
to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switch
without any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when needed
and put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would further
reduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of course
I would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
route it directly to the mother board.

I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  Does anyone know the
voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?  

Thanks.

Geez, we are a Sony familly. Our neighbor works for Zeinth and hates
it (always asks why we didn't buy Zeinth products). Nice guy
nevertheless. We still have two working Sony Color Trinitrons from
1972 and 1974. Older one is on it's second picture tube, but both
work. Now they're relegated to the old 8-bit atari computer and atari
2600 game machinces, as well as our not-that-old younger sister's
Nintendo game machine. Sony doesn't make TV's like they used to
though, the newer Mexican assembly-line TV's are not that reliable or
sharp anymore... Dad also just got a 35"" direct-view Sony (god, the
thing weighs a ton!). :)  Still, where would we be without Trinitrons,
CD players, or the veritable Walkman????

I have been using the PLI (SONY) 3.5"" MO drive and now a Sharp color
scanner using standard SCSI cables and STANDARD $20 terminator on my Q700. 
No problems.  If you were using a IIfx, that might be another story.

Make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
end.  Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
others are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminations
cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2
boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
disabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".

My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that they
must have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.  My PLI MO
drive and Sharp scanner has one for each.

Good luck.

I have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher
speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different
 speeds. There was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but
if the SI uses timing loops anything like a Quadra for accessing its floppy
drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. A Quadra must reboot after having its
clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its

Sunny,

I asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on 
it's side.  I received a response from someone at Seagate (Sorry I 
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (Seagates at the 
least) can very well compensate for gravity.  This means that a 
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data 
integrity problems.  The only way that newer drives cannot work is if you 
have varying forces (shaking, bouncing, etc) so don't place the drive on 
it's side on a rocking chair :).  What constitutes a 'newer' drive I 
don't know, try calling your drive manufacturer.  I have a Quantum LP240S 
internal, and since I got it a month ago, I am guessing it's 'newer'.

64 mhz TTL clock oscillator I had left over from working on some SI's.
I can't believe it. It actually works. I'm not getting SCSI timing errors
either. This is only after a short run time but I'll keep posting results.
Did I spend all that money on the VSO for nothing? If this keeps working,
the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort.

It would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).


Otherwise the other possibilities would be:

1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
port on mac, collect data with some communications program.

2) Buy an A/D chip from Analog devices, Burr-Brown, etc, connect to
a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
(nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)

3) Get a board from National Instruments, Data Translation, Omega,
etal.  The finest solution, but possibly the most costly.



To the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
use a voltage divider? Two resistors, cost very cheap...

According to the official documentation, failure to use the IIfx terminator
can not only affect SCSI bus performance but can also damage the bus.
Whether this is your problem or not I don't know. I have had sporadic SCSI
problems with my IIfx since I bought it. (I cannot connect more than three
devices, fourth one causes major problems).

First thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.
If you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. If it formats fine
then I would try to format it on your system with no externals. If this 
fails then the SCSI controller on your IIfx needs repair/replacement.

Hope this helps.

    Well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
if you have a large (16"" or greater) color monitor. Generally what I do
is leave my Mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash, but I turn my monitor off each night before I leave my
office. I also turn off After Dark when I do this, since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor's tube.

>Actually, I thought Macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.

    Really? What makes you think this? The Q700 file server in my office
has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any
problems. (Note: I also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
when I'm not actually working on the server itself.)

Summary: Quadra 700 Clock Acceleration Instructions
Keywords: Quadra,clock,acceleration,oscillator
Article-I.D.: shelley.1r577lINNjks
Organization: University of Washington
Lines: 149
NNTP-Posting-Host: carson.u.washington.edu

Here is how I modified my Quadra 700 for higher speed. Previously I
had been using a Variable Speed Overdrive for accelerating my CPU
but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.

Your mileage may vary. The top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand. My personal Q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.
I didn't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds.

Parts

	Clock Oscillators (4 pin TTL variety) You will need a selection of
	speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. The CPU will run at 1/2 the
	oscillator speed. The original one is a 50 mhz unit. I recommend
	getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.

	   I obtained my clock oscillators from DigiKey 1-800-344-4539 for
	   less than $5.00 each. Some of their part numbers are:

		   50 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X121)
		   62 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # X136)
		   66 mhz TTL Clock Oscillator (part # CTX137)

	   Don't get the half size clock oscillators. They won't fit.

	   There are also CMOS clock oscillators. I haven't tried one in a
	   Quadra. (They work fine in IIsi's)
	   
	Socket: Obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
	   a 14 pin DIP package. Alternatively, use 4 machined socket pins
	   from an Augat style socket. Just cut them out of the socket.

	Cooling Fan: A very small 12 volt fan to keep the CPU cool is a 
	   must. My VSO came with a specially modified heatsink which had
	   a fan built onto it. It had a pass-through connector which
	   tapped into the hard drive power cable. You should rig up 
	   something similar or risk frying your CPU.
	   
Procedure

1)  Insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2)  Remove the top lid of the machine. You will see the floppy disk and
    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static
    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do
    this. Unplug ALL cables, wall and monitor power supply cords from
	the back of the mac.
 
3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may
    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you
    need release.
 
4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon
    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.
    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
    to release it.
                                            
5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount

6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A
    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop
    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
    here.

7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding
	posteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
	lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8)  Remove the interrupt switch assembly. It is a strangely shaped plastic
    device at the left, front edge of the motherboard. Pull the middle,
	rear plastic prong up and forward. The entire device will release.
	
9)  Unplug the speaker cable. Squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
    free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.
	
10) Remove the motherboard form the case. Lift the front right corner of
    the motherboard about 1 mm. This allows it to clear the clear plastic
	Power light guide. Slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. The
	motherboard then comes directly out.
	
11) Locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. It is a small metal box near the
    CPU chip. Note and remember its orientation. The new clock oscillators
	must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.
	
	Very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. Some of
	the pins may be bent over. Simply desolder then unbend them. Be sure
	your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.
	
	I used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. This is
	NOT appropriate for a first soldering experience. The motherboard is
	a multi-layer design with very fine traces - easily damaged without
	proper care.
	
12) Install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) Put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. You could use the
	old clock but it has solder on its pins. This may come of inside the
	socket and cause corrosion problems later. I suggest using a new
	50 mhz clock.
	
14) Install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.
	
14) Reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) Snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
    board firmly. Plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.
	
16) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
	1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into
	place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
    into place.
	
17) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY
    DRIVE CABLE.

18) Replace the phillips head screw

19) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) Reattach your cables and power cords. Cross your fingers and turn 
    on the Mac. It should make the usual power on chord. If it doesn't,
	something is amiss. Immediately turn of the power and recheck your
	handiwork. If all is not well, you have my sincere condolences.
	
	Hopefully, all will work normally. Turn the machine back off and
	replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. Reboot and
	be astounded. 
	
	You will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
	a particular speed is truly usable. With my VSO, a machine lock-up
	might take 8 hours of operation to occur. In the brief time since
	modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) I have not had a single
	problem.
	
Good Luck to all who attempt this modification. There is a small but real
risk, but you could well reach Quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
$50 in parts.

Hi there,


I have a question regarding Quadras VRAM. I have tried to find info on this
but I could not get precise answers.

On one hand, we have a Quadra 950 with a 16"" monitor, which is capable of
32-bit color. How much VRAM does it have?
On the other hand, we have a Quadra 800 with a 16"" monitor, which is capable
of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 Ko of VRAM.

I would like to take VRAM SIMMs for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
both machines have 16-bit color capability.
Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?
From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
16-bit color, is that correct?

Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they
seem to be *behind* the power supply. Do I really have to take off the power
supply to access the VRAM SIMMs?


Thanks for your help!

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).

some opinions of people who use the 160 and 180 day-to-day on if its worth
taking the disk size and money hit to get the active display?  (i realize
this is a real subjective question, but i've only played around with the
machines in a computer store breifly and figured the opinions of somebody
who actually uses the machine daily might prove helpful).

Hi!

   I'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my Mac has
two serial ports, I have AppleTalk, a modem, a printer, MIDI, and a sound
digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)

   Specifically, I'm looking at the Axion electronic switcher, because it
seems to be fairly cheap.  (About $128 at MacZone.)

   Does anyone know anything about it?  I've heard that with most of these
things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
from physically swapping cables.  Although I've also heard that programs
that use the Comm Toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
want; does anyone know if this is true with the Axion switchbox?

   Finally, if the Axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
think is good, I'd be interested in hearing about other products.  I would
like to spend under $140, if possible.

   Please reply through mail; I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.

Does anyone work with the A/ROSE card?

We have the problem that after certain crashes the card disappears from the
system, and lets crash the Mac then.

Okay, we don't use the card quite like one should, because we simulate
errors in the 68000. Before every instruction some specified registers are
masked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.

Normally, the ""crash instance"" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag and
stops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a card
crash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes the
card doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.

The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behavior
when crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzing
the assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.

So, can anyone help?
Please only reply via email, as I don't read this group.

Subject: Accelerating the MacPlus...;)
Lines: 15

We're about ready to take a bold step into the 90s around here by accelerating
our rather large collection of stock MacPlus computers. Yes indeed, difficult
to comprehend why anyone would want to accelerate a MacPlus, but that's another
story. Suffuce it to say, we can get accelerators easier than new machines.
Hey, I don't make the rules...

Anyway, on to the purpose of this post: I'm looking for info on MacPlus
acelerators.  So far, I've found some lit on the Novy Accelerator and the
MicrMac MultiSpeed Accelartor. Both look acceptable, but I would like to hear
from anyone who has tried these.  Also, if someone would recommend another
accelerator for the MacPlus, I'd like to hear about it.

Thanks for any time and effort you expend on this!

I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
price of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeek
reports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guess
is that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the price
structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.

Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed for
mine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the new
machines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of my
IIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced me
to purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feel
betrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
week (heh).

Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you wait
until the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
well wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break and
then the units which follow them.  You may save some money but
you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
computer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
state of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising them
again (grin).

Yes, quite a number of people it seems from discussions I've had (me
included). I bought my machine a couple of weeks ago as well and
started to experience these problems.

Apple Australia via my dealer said that this problem has a number of
potential causes - Faulty applications, faulty third party hardware
(modems, memory etc), system software, PRAM corruption and power
manager corruption, and the Duo hardware itself.

None of the above are relevant in my case except the last two maybe
(no applications were running, the system software was re-installed, I
have no additional hardware). I have found that clearing PRAM appears
to help for a while at least (hold down command option P and R on
startup). Unfortunately the problem returns suggesting that PRAM is
being corrupted by something (system software bug ? - I don't have any
non-issue inits in my system). Apparently the Power Manager can be
reset by ""holding the reset and interrupt buttons while powering up"" -
Apple's advice - but since the Duo does not have an interrupt button
I'm not sure what they mean in this case. This may also help if
someone can decipher Apple's advice for me.

Beyond this Apple suggest that "" you should follow the technical
procedures to check the hardware of this Duo"". Since so many others
appear to be having the same problem it would seem to me that there
has been a system software bug introduced somewhere along the line -
and quite recently too - since it only seems to be recent Duo 230
purchasers who have this problem.

Any more comments from others in the same boat are welcome,
particularly Apple Duo engineers :-)

Besides the faster processor, the 950 has SCSI 2, and as far as I know, faster
I/O due to separate processors handling those functions. The 950 can output 16

My Datadesk Mac 101E keyboard has similar problems. I have found that

Similarly, I have trained myself to hold down the RIGHT-HAND pair of

Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation.

Bad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for Apple
Macintosh PowerBook Duos) 
MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.

COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993

By Raines Cohen

     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBook
Duos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data loss
and other problems.

     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last week
issued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAM
products from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.
Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.

     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM called
selfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  But
Technology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards with
nonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail to
wake from sleep.

     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the part
number stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chips
instead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, may
not tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it uses
nonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshed
while the Duo sleeps.

     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duo
cards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, Technology
Works said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond are
certified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.

     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offers
Duo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which is
compatible with the slower chips.

     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed that
some third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the corner
of the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normally
when in a Duo Dock.

     Lifetime Memory Products Inc. of Huntington Beach, Calif., said it
originally shipped cards with this problem but has since offered all
customers free upgrades to cards that fit.

Even the 68000 can fetch two bytes at a time.

The new instruction in the 68040 is MOVE16 which fetches 16 bytes
at a time instead of 4 which the 68030 has; that means 4 24bit

Benchmarks are for marketing dweebs and CPU envy.  OK, if it will make
you happy, the 486 is faster than the 040.  BFD.  Both architectures
are nearing then end of their lifetimes.  And especially with the x86

The point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
computers performance.  Clock speed, processor, memory speed, CPU
architecture, I/O systems, even the application program all contribute 
to the overall system performance.

My wife has one of these.  I have not had much chance to fiddle with

is quite apparent even when the print setting on the Select 310 is

objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some

a scanned photo on a LaserWriter IIg. I have tried scanning at a 
higher resolution and the display on the screen appears very nice.  
However, the printed version is coming out ugly!  

Is this due to the resolution capabilities of the printer?  Or are 
there tricks involved to get better quality?   Or should we be 
getting something (like PhotoShop) to ""pretty up"" the image?
I will appreciate any suggestions.

The Sound Driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. Sound Manager used by the
book is *useless*. Disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (It's too slow.)

The Sound Driver is so much snappier than Sound Manager. Unfortunately,
System 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.

Well, I want my code to work on old systems too. I don't know about sys 7.1,
but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the Sound Manager that causes
channels to hang (with no error message). This happends when I keep a
channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
sounds, stopping sounds halfway. Callbacks seems not to be reliable.
Then only way I can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (QHead, I think it was), and the
only way I have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
*undocumented* flag and modify it.

Am I happy with this? Nope. I consider writing to SoundBase simply to get
rid of the bugs.

Any better suggestions? (Silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)

It is a data aquisition board for the Mac II series.  It is called
the DMA Board with GPIB Interface.  You may call NI at 800-IEEE-488

Apple doesn't make such a card, though I suppose a third party could.  One
big problem is that there isn't room for a standard NuBus card inside the

I've got two CD300's... The first one i ordered Jan 15, and I received it Feb. 20.
The second one I ordered Jan 20th, and I just got it April 2nd or so. Anyway, they
both come with 10 misc. CDROMs... Things like a ""Intro to Nautilis"", a sample CD
of Kodak pictures, ""From Alice to Ocean"" (a story of a woman who treked across
Austrailia), 3 discs from apple, a games disc, an applications disc, and a ""titles""
disc (haven't checked most of these out yet). Also some ""Cinderella"" thing for kids,
a disc of Mozart something-or-others, etc. etc. etc. If someone's super interested,
I'll make a list of the exact titles and post them. They are all in the category of
""Interesting, but probably fairly useless..."". It was rumored that the earliest 
units shipped with SOME encyclocpedia (it may have), but neither of my drives had
that.

After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, I
came up with:
ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^M
This is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.
Quick summary of each commmand:
Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.
L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)
X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)
&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always on
S11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)

In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 right
before the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer 
function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra
14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.

In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changed
the 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, and
everything seems to work fine.

Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forward
this to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save other
newbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, and
also save the net some redundant messages.  If anyone else has something
to add, feel free.

Subject: Asante EN/SC hangs SCSI devices
Reply-To: behr@math.ilstu.edu (Eric Behr)
Organization: Central Illinois Surfing Club
Lines: 31

I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SC
adapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed the
newest drivers from Asante's ftp server.

The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -
specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mac
tests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, the
power light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can use
the network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes the
Asante box pretty much unusable.

It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turn
on the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticed
during the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapter
works, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has
*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've had
it for over a year).

Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --
several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at the
head or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator
(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internal
resistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying another
identical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.

Has anybody seen this? More importantly, does anyone have a solution?
Thanks a lot.    E.

You're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
I've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
no, repeat no, internal modems for the Duo besides the Express
Modem... at _any_ speed.  Something having to do with the modem
using the main CPU for some of its tasks, and Apple not releasing
details on the architecture, or something.  I'm vague on the
details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
third-party internal Duo modems.  If I'm wrong, somebody please
correct me on this.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

Well, I also have an LC III.  Popping the top revealed:

	One ""socket"" for an additional VRAM SIMM

	One ""socket"" for a 72-pin RAM SIMM

	One socket for a flat-pack FPU

	A processor-direct slot (PDS) identical to the LC/LC II, but with
	an additional set of connetions to one side (for the full 32-bit

That's it.  I guess a board with a PowerPC chip could be made that would fit
in the PDS, but that's the only place.

incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so I have to run with it turned off.
Actually, the main thing I don't like it is that it doesn't have a software
powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is DIRECTLY UNDER THE FLOPPY DRIVE!  (I
haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night I'm going

There has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement.  True,
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but
the internal power supply is well-protected. (I've turned my Mac on and off 
six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  The monitor is
the same.  To leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much
as a television, possibly more.

Turn it off when you're not using it.  It'll save you money and the world
a few more resources.

Because SCSI works well with removable media, and works well with large
capacity devices. The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but
it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge
it. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room for
expansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25"",
a 3.5"", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. The
possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).

I purchased an LCIII recently and had heard a bit about a re-work of the
logic board.  I opened mine up and found the same re-work, with a small
chip glued to the board and a couple of green wires running from it to two 
other chips.  I'd like to know more about it.  Could anyone with any or all of
the following information please post it?  Thanks a bunch.

1.	What does the re-work accomplish (i.e., what does it fix)?
2.	What are the technical details of the re-work?  (I'm looking for
	things such as the purpose of the chips with the new wires connected,
	and the pin-outs for those chips.)
3.	Is a board with the re-work any different functionally from one without?
4.	Could the re-worked boards be incompatible with future releases of
	the operating system?

	and, finally,

5.	Should I even be concerned about any of this?

Mac sound hardware is diverse; some macs play in stereo and
mix the output (the SE/30 for instance) while others play in
stereo but ONLY has the left channel for the speaker, while
some are ""truly"" mono (like the LC)

Developers know that stuff played in the left channel is
guaranteed to be heard, while the right channel isn't. Some
send data to both, some only send data to the left channel
(the first is preferrable, of course)

	Maybe you should contact your schools officials and make

allows the Unix works stations to shuts off its monitor when

I'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,
etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any
controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
because the designers put them there deliberately.

The real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or

From what I've heard the PDS slot clock is only 16MHz, to be
compatible with the old LC style boards, while the FPU socket close to
the CPU is clocked at 25MHz.

I guess a board designed for the LCIII can get a 25MHz clock from the
extended PDS socket...

    This is something I asked before, but I don't think I got an answer, or
maybe I lost the answer, or maybe it's just an obvious question (:->). Will 
the GX stuff (on-line docs etc.) be available on the DEVELOP CDs, or will it

First of all, I wouldn't advise wasting your time with Apple.  They'll
treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal
opinion).

The safest thing to do is match the SVGA monitor's scanning rates with
Apple's rates.  I don't know Apple's video scanning rates, but I use the
Micron Xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation.

About cables: you just have to go out to someplace like Fry's and get a
few Mac-VGA cables and try them out.  I have a ViewSonic 5E (14"") and I
use an NEC adaptor.  Other monitors may use other adaptors.  I also have
a Mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks System into thinking the monitor is an
Apple 16"".  I need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it
works fairly well.

I have a (very old) Mac 512k and a Mac Plus, both of which

Their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt
(such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes 
all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).

I have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the 
video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires
made the screen come back on.  This worked for a while, but the
blanking out has returned.

Can I do anything?  Do I need a new power supply?  A new CRT?
A new computer?

Thanks for any advice...

All I know is that the Megadrives worked perfectly on both my
Mac Plus and my Powerbook 140.  It was for this reason I assumed
the problem had something to do with the Quadra.  Even with the
Quadra, they mostly worked OK.  The problem occurred when I ejected
a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
saying ""This cartridge must be formatted with Jasmine Driveware""
even though there was no cartridge in the drive.

  Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
copy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
comparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:

  25 MHz 68040
  16 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
      than Q 950 style machines for sure).
  Ethertalk card on-board
  Audio in/out
  4 MB RAM on motherboard
  4 SIMM slots
  2 NuBus slots.
  More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.

In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give you
  audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
  With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but I
  think it ends up costing more.

    If you mean in a ""newer, more powerful"" Mac system then the answer
is no. Apple has stated that all new Macs will use the 72-pin SIMMs and
no longer use the 30-pin SIMMs.

The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than
Apple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.

That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire
(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly
remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all
of them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered
DESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used
with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.

My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:

(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add
    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going
    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.
    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it
    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).

(2) On the Mac side, you will need:
    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).
    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).
    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be
      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).
    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is
      self-terminated or not.
    - configure MacTCP to use ""Ethernet"".

(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:
    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.
    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.
      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the
      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable
      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).
    - get a 25ohm terminator.

Your two-machine network will look like this:

It clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
cases it will do fine. The critical information from the neuron is in
the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per
seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
signal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
convertor is more then sufficient.

AC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases
you are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled
also. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If
the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly
distorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the
occurrence of the spike that is important. 

However, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start
battling with the toolbox to get it going. As yet I have no clue were
to start looking for the technical specifications.

Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on
numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex
injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up
development work.
Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery
cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three
years late.

Designing metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA,
now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.

Any other suggestions?

Subject:    Mac II vi to be discontinued. Good buy?

A local dealer is offering Mac II vi machines equipped with Kodak multi-
session compatible CD-ROM drives for what seems like an attractive price:
$1500. I've used many other models up to a II ci, but this would be the
first I could have my own Mac. Is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued
model such as this. I'd like to yank the CD-ROM drive out, put it in a
housing and share it with my PC. Is this feasible? The only info I have on
the II vi is that it is relatively slow (16MHz), has an 68030 chip with a
math coprocessor. I want to add a non-Apple portrait monitor and use this
machine for HyperCard stack design. Is this a good buy, or would I be
wasting my money? I would appreciate some advice. Thanks!

This problem is most likely the same that all cx users are experiencing....
Thanks to one very adventurous USENET reader (sorry I can't remember the
guy's name!  Somebody please post it....he deserves the credit for saving
us all $$$$$) it is easily fixed, if it is the same problem......


Best I can figure it is due to time, heat and repeated warmup/cool downs in
the power supply....i.e., bad solder joints in the power supply circuit
card.  Go get a desolder tool from radio shack, a low wattage iron and some
good nonacid solder and resolder the lower left quadrant of the circuit
card with the AC plugs facing away from you..........or get someone to do
it for you.  It took me less then 10 minutes and saved me at least $300 for
a new supply!

Hi.  I think I have a problem with the stereo sound output on my Quadra
900, but I am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
on his PowerBook 170.  Any info or experience anyopne has would be
greatly appreciated.

When I hook my Quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types
of sounds (mono, as far as I can tell) all play fine through BOTH
speakers:

system beeps  (already provided ones such as Indigo and ones I record)

Armor Alley
Spectre
Spaceward Ho!


But, the following games only play out of the left channel:

Lemmings
Out of This World  (awesome game, BTW)
Glider 4.0
OIDS


But still, STEREO system beeps do play in stereo, through BOTH speakers.
(The one I'm specifically referrring to is Apocolyptic Beginning, which
my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))


All of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run
OOTW because he doesn't have color).

We're both running system 7.1



Does anyone with Lemmings or the other three games I mentioned above get
sound out of both speakers on a Mac II class, Quadra, LC, PowerBook 140 or
greater, Centris, SE/30, etc... (stereo) machine?

I used to have a Mac II, and I sort of rememeber Lemmings playing in
stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (I could be
mistaken, though.  If there were a problem with the Quad 900's and PB
170's, I am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  If there
isn't a problem with our machines, I wonder why the 4 games above are
apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
both speakers  (like Spectre, etc. do)?

Quadra 900's and PowerBook 170's have the same ROMS (to my knowledge),
so maybe this is a ROM problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't System 7.1
patch over this problem?)




Thanks for any help you can provide!

I think all Powerbooks use the same 2 Meg upgrade, but the
4 Meg and 6 Meg upgrades are different for the PB100 than
for the other PBs.

Hi folks,

	what exactly is the maximum memory I can put in
a Quadra 700. My manual says 20MB (with 4 x 4MB SIMMs), 
but MacWarehouse and the like advertise 16MB SIMMs to
give it a total of 68MB. Who's wrong? Has anybody got
68MB?


Thanks,

I believe the FPU on the LCIII is always supposed to go on the logic
board, not in the PDS board. I have heard of crashing problems with
PDS-based FPUs on the LCIII. Asante may have fixed them but why
bother. Why bother building an LCIII card with an FPU anyway? The
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. I say FPU on
main logic board, in socket, Ethernet alone on PDS card, in slot.

        Interesting, as I think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree.  I know of several people I work
with that make just as much as I do and they don't even have
a BS degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  They also
didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local University either. :(
       I think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice, than a truly specialty field.  It will be even more
so in the future.
       If your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose CS as I did, I suggest checking out the emerging field
of Software Engineering.  The difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides
the missing key for some good groundwork!

Well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are
in no financial position to continue Graduate work right out
of a Top 10 comp sci school.

The trick is, to find some generous INC you work for to PAY for the
rest of your education...TRUST ME its the best way to go..even
if you don't get a TOP salary.  Which I have always been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow this rule: BOOK=SALARY=FOOD&SHELTER
you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry.

Well, here are the results of the Mathematica test which I posted to

I was just curious how fast the plot command would be executed on
various Macintosh machines as well as other personal computers and

Funny how the IIsi running at 25 MHz is slower than other equivalent
machines, lots slower in fact.  Perhaps the version of Mathematica
makes a difference or the fact that not much RAM was allocated.
Another interesting thing is how fast the SGI did it.  Wow. 

Basically, though, I wouldn't draw any conclusions from this data.  It
seems that Mathematica's speed is dependant on a lot of variables.  I
was just curious how different machines would measure up.

Hmmm... that's not quite right.  The Performa 600 is Real Darn Close
to the IIvx (but a better buy IMO).  I also don't think they are so
much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
Why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  Hardly a business
application. 

What do you mean by 'no ""retail price""'.  Quite the contrary, I think.
The price is darn near the same all across the country.  That (again,
IMO) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
required.  Kinda like the Saturn (car) of the computer set.  One
price, medium performance, ready to go.

When I shopped for my Performa (600CD), the difference between Sears
(*sigh), Montgomery Wards, Silo (*sigh), Circuit City (*sigh*) and
Bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  Why I chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells Apples?).  Admittedly, except for Montgomery Wards (and I
suspect I was just lucky) all of the salesfolk I spoke to didn't know
didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  But then, neither did any
of the  Apple dealers I spoke with...

If you would've told me a year ago that I would buy a Macintosh from
Montgomery Wards I woulda laughed for a long, long time.  Go figure.
I'm *real* happy with my Performa.  Oh, and I bought the Apple
Performa Plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  Happy with that
decision as well.  I walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before Christmas.

**************************

    having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.  at
least for the 600x400 configuration.  you can get an adaptor called Mac
VGA -Q from James engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable.  I think the
800x600 requires 56Khz horizontal sync.  I use this on my sony 1604. 
(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.

Actually, the 295 is for the 33 MHz PowerCard, not the Universal Powercache.
The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about
$500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation 
older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many
Macs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based.

I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise 
different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).

I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these
Powercards were going very fast.

Hi there,

Does anyone know why Apple has an ambiguous message for
C650 regarding fpu?  In all Mac price lists I've seen, every C650
has the message ""fpu: optional"".  I know from what we've discussed in this
newsgroup that all C650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80
configuration.  Why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
price list?
I'm planning to buy the C650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but I'm now getting
confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.
Why say ""optional"" if it's built in?
Please, anybody help me understand this game.

Regards,

Thian.

I guess he is right. Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either,

from RasterOps.

Very easy. If you boot without the MODE32 control panel, then it will
disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. So when
you run OK you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. Check About this Macintosh
and see if you havce a 12+MB system.

When I owned an SE, I replaced the fan with SE Silencer, available, I
believe, from MacWarehouse or MacConnection.  It comes with instruction for
installation and requires no soldering.  Worked like a charm.  I think the
manufacturer is Mobius.

Subject: MACINTOSH LAB!!! HELP!!!

Interesting delema for all those out there.
My school is discussing installing a Mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our Bio
100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections.  (no joke)  Here is the
deal. We can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a
disection via the computer or via the real thing.  My problem is I was somehow
drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go Mac but know
NADA about them, being the man mac man on campus, guess who they came to?) so I
wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing
list?  Right now we are looking at the C650 8/80 and the 2vx 5/80 platforms.
Ok here it goes:

	We are using cd-rom, so ought we go with the internal Apple Cd-roms
offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. It is a matter of price
and reliability, the second being VERY important.
	How much RAM?  I was thinking 5-8 more leaning towards 8?  What do you
think?
	Ok, called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
(extended) is 160.30. Is it better to go with the Apple and their long time
great wear and tear record, or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable?  Price?
	Printers:  One color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
Thermal Wax Tektronic 200e or 200i (Probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we don't needed the i's networkability)  So, what do you think in
terms of color printers?  Different brand?  Kind (Dye Sublimation?  Ink Jet?) 
Price? Companies?  1800 #s?  Also, we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing.  The fornt runner is
the Apple Pro650 (is that right don't have my notes here?) at 1650. 
Suggestions?  We have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part. It has to be reliable, easy
to maintain, and economical (ie, not high priced paper cartidges, etc).
	Finally, and this is my little dig into the Project. What about netting
these things?  We have ether nearby and I would like to slap the macs on the
net, but, server?  Individual ether?  Forget about it it is going to be
astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask
them?
	Little more info, I am a Poli Sci major who just happens to know alot
about macs but this is a bit out of my league, not to mention I don't have the
time to go and look for all of this stuff. So I am hoping the collective
resources and intelect of the net can help (Has before) [Shameless plug: BUY

A question in general about displaying NTSC through a Mac.

If I understand correctly, the Video Spigot can display NTSC
in a small window as well as capture the data in Quicktime
format.

However, if I want to use a larger window, what are my options?
Perhaps I misunderstood the Video Spigot review...  

Also, I am not interested in Quicktime.  I would merely like to
use my Mac as a television from time to time.  I have a nice
Sony 1430 monitor, and I would like to use it as a second TV
when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular TV.  

Perhaps some of the video cards for the Mac accept NTSC input?
I have a IIsi, and I am willing to buy a NuBus adapter.

My 610 is working great.  I haven't heard of any problems.  Sounds
to me like your dealer doesn't know what he's talking about.  It's
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the Centris 610 on the basis
of problems with one machine.  Recommending the IIvx over the LCIII
doesn't make a lot of sense either.  If this person is so convinced the 610
is buggy have they talked to Apple about it or are they just assuming
it's a problem with all of them?

The original Mac II had an Apple MMU chip installed which performs a subset
of the 68851's functions.  If you look underneath your front left floppy
bay you will find three chips, all approximately the same size.  One will
be the 68020, the next the 68881, and the third, approximately the same
size, will be the Apple chip.  It is easy to spot because it has a 'hump'
in the middle of it.


Example:


                         -----------
                        /           \

Hey All-

We have an old (1990) external HD attached to the Plus in our lab.  It had  
given us flawless service until last week.  The problem: Someone in our lab  
has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a Plus with an  
aftermarket SIMM/SCSI setup (Digigraphics ""SIMMer"").  the DB25 SCSI plug runs  
through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26-pin  
rectangular connector.  Well, this guy had removed the back from the machine,  
to put more memory in, and had disconnected the the SCSI plug.  Since the  
26-pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside  
down, essentially reversing the pins on the DB25.  He came in and asked if he  
could try out our HD on his SCSI port (it had never been used).  Naive fools  
that we are, we said o.k..  His computer failed to recognize the drive.  Now,  
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it.  We tried Disk Doctor, and  
it doesn't recognize anything on the SCSI chain.  Could installing the SCSI  
upside down have wrecked the HD's driver board?  The drive seems to spin up  
all right and unpark itself upon powerup.  The events are too coincidental to  
attribute the problem to stiction.

Any help greatly appreciated-

An added advantate of waiting for the DayStar for the SE/30 is that,
just as with the '030 power cache, the '040 accelerator will plug into
the CPU socket, leaving the PDS slot free for a video card or ethernet
card.  With DayStar's upgrade path, it's a no lose situation.

Perhaps the reason is simple--maybe the marketing people who put together
the brochures and price lists weren't clear on the FPU issue. 

Afterall, Apple's literature is not always 100% correct. A funny one I
noticed recently is that some of the brochures on the Macs with CD
capability refer to the ""auto inkjet"" feature. This should have read ""auto
inject"" feature (as it does on some other correct brochures I've seen from
Apple). Since it was correct on some older brochures, I can only guess
that someone edited the copy, saw ""inject"" and thought it was a typo and
changed it to the more familiar word ""inkjet"".

Hmmm, what would that be? A printer built into the CD player? A way of
*writing* information to a CD? :-) :-)

I have a Lightening Scan Pro 256 hand scanner.  It came with scanning/editing
software, OCR software, and some plug-in modules for Photoshop et al.  The
scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly
accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  It also has dithered and line art
settings when grayscale isn't desired.  Great scanning software, easy to use.  I
frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image
in the note.  Hope this helps!

OTOH, some of us get lucky-- I've unplugged and replugged SCSI and ADB

Well Bill, There are 2MB soldered on the logic board and 2MB in the RAM
expansion slot giving you 4MB. The only thing you can do to upgrade to
the maximum Ram is to remove the 2MB expansion and install a 6MB expansion,
giving you a total of 8MB which is the max on a 170....You can try calling
TechWorks, or any other memory vendors out of MacWeek, MacWorld...etc....

Hello,

we need the code for decompression of Quicktime JPEG Pict files, as they
don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source.
The code should be in C Pascal or Modula. The code will be used on several
platforms to view pictures over ISDN. Perhaps a special hardware will be
put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a DSP with some support
chips)
If the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to
decompress
them.

This can be caused by two one of two things.  The first and easiest to fix is
interference from something around the monitor, such as another monitor or
other electrical device.  Try moving the system to another location to fix
that problem.

Second, because of the scan rate of the monitor, it tends to synchronize with
room lights and can cause the interference you are seeing.  Try turning off
all lights in the room(s) around the system and see if that helps.  If not,
try moving the system somewhere else.

A third solution would be to get a 14"" Apple Color Display - It should not
have the same problem the 12"" Color is more suceptible to.

You can try calling Apple's new support number (in the U.S.) at 1-800-SOS-APPLE.
This number is for ANYONE who has questions regarding Macintosh setup and
compatibility and just went into effect for this extended support on Monday,
April 5, 1993.

I am looking at a new LC III and a used IIci.  Prices
have yet to be worked out, so I'm just thinking right now
about their merits and drawbacks.

Here's what I've thought of:

The IIci has much greater potential for expansion, a la NuBus and
greater memory capacity.

The LC III would be new, under warranty, newer ROMs (is the IIci
""32-bit clean""?), and would have sound input.  I also like the
""pizza-box"" case.

Performance-wise, I have read that they are almost identical, the
LC III being a little slower.

So, which should I get?

	Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two 
weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store) 
appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered
the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.
He wanted to know if that would be ""alright with me""!!!  They must
be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them
with!  

	Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  
Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first
time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been
pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
	The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've
heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get
it swapped.
	I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This
wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location
of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for
these functions was much more convenient.
	Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.
I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...
	Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!

I'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGA

All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not work
on a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like the
sony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was very
attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am I
confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used an
LCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get your
adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get a
apple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
IBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we can
afford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!

I believe that in order to get at the innards of the new mouse,

I haven't tried it myself yet, but when I ran my fingernail

I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is

to do this?  Someone told me that I should only use
SIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,

Is there a workaround which will enable me to print to a HPLJ4 from my
Powerbook 100? (Actually I'm going to a 4M which will have an Ethernet card in
the LocalTalk slot!!!GRRRRR). Is there some hardware which will enable me to
this easily (kind of plug and play!).

Noooooooo!  I've been servicing Macs for years too, and I've had to
repair a number of motherboards that had been damaged this way.  It's
rare, but it does happen.

Mind you, this doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.  The parts that can
blow (the ADB power fuse and RF filter) aren't too expensive, so IF you
have a someone around who can do component-level repair, it may be worth
the risk (especially if you're around Seattle, 'cause you might get to
pay *me* to fix it :-))..  On the other hand, if your only repair option
is the Apple-standard logic board swap (major $$$$), you should probably
play it safe.

This is a system extension for these NuBUS cards using the

Motorola 68000-Processor and 512 KB RAM (expandable to 1 Meg).
MCP is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card
with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.
Currently the only cards I know are

- the Apple TokenRing-Card
- the new Apple Ethernet-Card
- the Apple NuBUS serial card

Perhaps there are some third-party-cards, but I don't know.

  A 256K DRAM chip is a 256 kilobit chip whereas a 256K SIMM is a 256
kilobyte memory module. The SIMM is a PCB with a 30 pin connector edge
and on the SIMM are 8 256 kilobit DRAM chips (making the total memory 256
KBytes.
 
  You are correct assuming that SIMMs will not fit into a LaserWriter.
Apple printers either require 64 pin SIMMs like those in the Mac IIfx or
special memory chips. Contact your Apple dealer to find out exactly what
kind of chips you need.

Subject: HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx
Keywords: SCSI, IIfx
Organization: NASA Ames Research Center 
Lines: 46

I am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old
and I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for
two and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining
5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.
The error message reported was like:

Sector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.

This occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the
diagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after
reinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes
2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,
but still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall
System 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,
I now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:

   o Frequent crashes
   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to
       correct.
   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.
       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the
         disk either.
       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes
         requires several attempts.

QUESTIONS:

   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?
   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard
      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some
      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?
   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest
      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the
      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx
      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal
      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with
      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).
      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;
      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of
      course who knows :-<

Help would be much appreciated.

I believe that Apple, Sun and a number of other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
power-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in
other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see
it.  This may include the ability for the system to fully power down
the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on
automatically.  (Is this a ""sell"" on screen saver software companies?)

Goals for ""idle"" power consumption have been set at something like 30
watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on
this).

Note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,
especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.
Sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
the night would save the company (Sun itself) on the order of $1M per
year.  Putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would
probably have greater than double that value.

Given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),
building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data I heard.

BTW: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front.  There was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling.  This may only apply to the monitors we use, but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back.

I'm currently trying to select which magneto-optical drive to purchase.  I'm
primarily looking at 128MB drives, although I might consider 256MB ones.

When looking through MacWorld and MacUser ads, the prices for the 128MB drives
seem to range from just under $1000 (for the DGR 128REM Portable, Magic 128MB
Portable Fujitsu, or NuDesign 128MB from MacDirect) to about $1600 (for the
FWB HammerDisk 130 and Mass Microsystems DataPak MO/128).  Different drives
use different mechanisms - MOST, Fujitsu, Sony, Epson, probably some others.

My problem is that after reading the Nov 92 MacWorld and Apr 93 MacUser
reviews of these drives, I'm still not sure what to get.  So, I'm asking
if anyone has had good/bad experiences with any 128MB M-O drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me
much?), reliability of different drives, compatibility between them, or 
anything else I should probably know.

Thanks.

Do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
Apple uses in the powerbook Duos?  Or in the powerbook in general?

What are the factors that make the Duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop  
machine running the same processor at the same speed (25MHz 68030)?  How many  
wait states are in the memory system, etc?  What kind of a data bus does it  
use?  32-bit or 16-bit?  

It's still slow when plugged into a DuoDock.

Anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when  
making notebooks?  I heard of a 486DX2/66 notebook getting a ""whopping"" 10  
MIPS rating.  A similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,  
I guess.

I thought I'd share a good experience, too.  I bought the APS Quantum 240 zero
footprint drive in May '92 (back when they still used two separate LEDs on the
front panel and the case was metal).  While traveling with it (it was in my
SE/30 Mac bag, on top of the Mac) this past winter, one of the plastic tabs
holding the front panel on broke, so that the right side of the front panel
was coming forward away from the rest of the drive.  I lived with this situation
until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a
network shutdown at school and a trip out of town I had to take, which gave me
some dead time during which to have the drive sent out).

I called APS for an RMA # and got one, with no questions asked about how the
tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers --
though nothing else was damaged [well, except for the internal speaker in my
modem, which wasn't that well glued down to begin with] -- yeah, yeah, I'm
never flying with my SE/30 again).  And when I called back to ask whether I
could send it in a little later rather than right away, they had no problem
with that -- even when I exceeded the normal valid period for an RMA # by a
day (they're usually good for 10 days).  The front panel was replaced under
warranty, and the drive was shipped back quickly (I mailed it first class
insured on a Saturday by noon from L.A. to Missouri, and it came back by Fed
Ex by Friday [I don't know exactly what day it came back because I was
traveling that week from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday afternoon]).

The only thing that could've been bad was that the first service rep I talked
to, in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data, suggested that I take the
drive mechanism out and send just the case.  Unfortunately, I discovered the
day I was mailing the thing, that would necessitate breaking the little
seal and thus voiding the warranty!  Oh, well.

Saying things like that incline one to believe that you can't get it (SCSI)

Hi!
A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII
in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time
was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,
I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought
in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down
converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can
be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really
trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just 
wondering.

Someone mentioned a while ago that the Duos were scheduled for a 
10-18% price reduction, according to 'newsbytes'.  Is this definite?
Does anyone know when it will take effect?  And what is 'newsbytes'?
Thanks.

The DayStar PowerCache for the SE/30 replaces the CPU with an accelerated
CPU plus the powercache.  This leavese the PDS slot open for a video card.
Currenty, DayStar does not have the '040 in this configuration, but it is
due out early next year.  With their upgrade policy, you can get the '030
accelerator now, and when the '040 version becomes available, you get
credit
for the one you have.  

I am running their 50 MHz version with FPU along with a Radius Precision
Color Pivot and I'm very satisfied.

	I'm looking for a Cache card for my IIsi. I can spend $250 Max for it,

	I need your advice about the best card i can buy. How much performance

Check out the National Instruments NB-DSP2300. This uses the Texas

The Partition button in Apple's HD Setup lets you set up A/UX and other
types of partitions. It WON'T let you create more than one normal mac
volume. You need SilverLining or something similar to do that. It WILL,
however, allow you to take advantage of some possible unused space on your
hard disk, if you don't mind reformatting the whole thing.

I first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  Finally it ""died"",

the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  Apple 
replaced the processor board.

Now,

  twice the machine has refused to wake up.  Acutally, the backlighting
    came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in
    (but not with a good battery).
    The first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery

    The second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until
      powered down for about 30 minutes.  The screen had what looked
      like red horizontal lines accross it.
    Both timse the file ""fax modem preferences"" has been corrupted

I need a device (either an ISA board or a subsystem) which will
take two RGB video signals and combine them according to a template.
The template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
But I beleive fancier harware may also exist which I do not want
to exclude from my search.  I know this sort of hardware exists
for NTSC, etc. but I need it for RGB.

Please email and or post any leads....

Hello all.
	I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
	I am mostly thinking about a 14"" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read an
old report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like the
Micron Xceed) ?
	Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towards
the Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?

Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.

I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
companys that sell monitors or cards.

Thanks in advance

I also returned PB memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
me not to use US mail.  I did (although I did insure the shipment), and 
apparently Techworks got it.

My minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
different people.  I ordered DUO memory, thinking I got their ""best"" price
because of my employeer.  I subsequently found out that Apple was offering
developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
and was told I should have said I was an apple developer and they credited
my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   I like techworks quality
and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
for out-of-CA purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.

What I did NOT get with my drive (CD300i) is the System Install CD you
listed as #1.  Any ideas about how I can get one?  I bought my IIvx 8/120
from Direct Express in Chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good
service).

BTW, I've heard that the System Install CD can be used to boot the mac;
however, my drive will NOT accept a CD caddy is the machine is off.  How can
you boot with it then?

Tell that to the Japanese, their local market is neatly protected by

I doubt this is a Quadra-specific problem.  I had to get

It is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front. Usually the easiest
place to put the switch is wherever the power cord enters the machine, and
people HATE power cords on the front!! I prefer a power strip.

Hi, I have been getting a lot of requests for this information so I thought
I would post it for those interested parties. (Sorry for length).

To increase the MacIISi speed to 25MHz or 33MHz the clock must be changed
from 40MHz to 50MHz or 64MHz respectively.
This is done by going to a static-free work station or putting some
aluminum foil down to work on.
	1. Open up the Si by lifting the tabs at the back of the case.
	2. Remove the Hard Disk by disconnecting the power and SCSI cables,
		spreading the tabs, and lifting the drive out.
	3. Remove the flopy drive.
	4. Remove the power supply by spreading the tab in front and lifting
		the supply straight up and out.
	5. Remove the fan by pressing the ears together at the back, bottom
		side of the fan and lifting straight up and out.
	6. Remove the Mother Board by spreading the tabs on the left and
		right side of the board and sliding the board forward then
		lifting the board out. (all connectors on the back of the
		board must be removed first)
	7. Desolder the 40MHz clock (the one closest to the memory modules).
		This is not easy even for a skilled solderer.
	8. Get an IC socket with the round pins and remove four of the pins
		by pushing them up from the bottom with long nose pliers.
	9. Put the four pins in the holes vacated by the clock and solder 
		them in.
	10.Insert a 50MHz or 64MHz clock.
	11.Put large power transistor heat sink's on the processor chip and 
		the other large chip just to the right of the processor and
		figure some way to hold the heat sync's in place. I made a
		simple clamp by putting a four inch screw up through the hole
		in the board between the two chips. Mount the screw using
		insulated washers. Screw a cross member down over the heat
		sync's to hold them in place. Don't use too much pressure.

	12. Put it all back together and go-for-it.

Disclaimer: this is only the procedure I used and is not authorized by anyone.
	    You are on your own for this procedure. I'm quite sure it will
	    void your warentee.

The Logitech ScanMan 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. Note that its effective
resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. If you don't intend
to magnify a graphic, it works fine. A true 256 level gray scanner would
work better for images.

I've seen the ScanMan go for as little as $100 used. It is a reasonable buy
at that price. Higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used
flat bed scanners. Here is Seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains
in the classifieds. Used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately.
Grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350.

Finally got my computer fixed and I'd like to sum up.

About hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad
sector or something) was an IBM.  The new one is a Quantum.  Is the LCIII
supposed to be shipped with IBMs?  Is there a quality difference? 
Apparently! :)

Second, about hard drive position.  I've put the LCIII on its side and
the new 160 HD has had no problems at all.  I've even switched back and
forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  As far
as I'm concerned I don't believe HD position is important for drives up
to 160 meg, in any computer.  Don't know about CD-ROM, though.

The 3FGx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49KHz, so driving it
at 60.24KHz to get 1024 x 768 on the Mac is WAY BEYOND the tolerance            The 4FG is spec'ed at 57KHz, so going 60.24KHz is only 5-6% above
the minimally guaranteed figure.

I too doubt if the Damark monitor would sync to a Mac at 1024 x 768.            Like most things, you get what you pay.  That's the deal.

Nope.  I'm pretty sure that this person knows how to take the ball out.
I think that what they want to do is take the mouse apart.  The old mouse

I am trying to put a 40MB drive from my LC into a case.  It is a Conner
CP3040A.  I can't figure out which jumpers are the SCSI ID jumpers.
Is anyone familiar with this drive?

At the end of the drive (oposite the 50 pin pibbon connector), there
are eleven pins which look like this:


        o o o o o   o   1
          o o o o   o   2

         L5  CR12   C37

where the ""o"" are pins, and the ""L5 CR12 C37"" represent some of the
silk screen notation near these pins.

Elsewhere on the board there are four jumper pads marked E1,E2,E3,E4
on the silk screen.

Does anyone know where the SCSI ID A0,A1,A2 pins are, and where the
drive activity light LED should be plugged into?

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on
your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it
cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my
computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it
off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
phosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :"")

Could be better caching on the disk.
Could be faster coil for seeks.
Could be that the disk spins faster so data transfers faster.
Could be that data is packed tighter so it transfers faster.
Could be a faster SCSI command decoder in the drive.

Sounds about right.

If there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
aggresively cut prices.  Once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  Waiting too long can
really hurt your business though :-)

The PowerBooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
down Apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
only reason I own a PowerBook is that I could spring for a $900 PB100,
the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  I'd bet they'll
be coming out with more power versions too.

Color Quickdraw performance across the Apple line.

The results:

The fastest QuickDraw color performing computer Apple makes is the

It probably won't work with any other LC.  The ones I have for the LC II
are Rev. D.  No, it won't work in the IIsi's PDS slot since it's a 68030
PDS, while the LC has the 68020 PDS.  The IIsi and SE/30 share the same

I have ordered several Macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero problem. You have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell Macs with authentic serial numbers untouched. There are value-added dealers (nothing to do with VAT, no flame please) that are very legitimate.

CDA unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent Apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to CDA.

   Here's my system desc:
   4 megs on the main board, 1 on the accelerator board
   mac -plus, with the most recent roms (D)
   trying to run system 6, but would like to run 7
   the hard drive is a jasmine, works fine if i start up with the 
	accelerator disabled
   i also seem to get the problem of when i try to start up from floppy
	with the hard-drive disconnected, all i get is the disk loading,
	but the screen is black, except for a happy mac in the middle,
	and it never gets anywhere

Hi!

I want to change the default paper cassette on our LaserWriter Pro 630
from the 250-sheet cassette to the 500-sheet cassette. Right now, we all
have to change it manually on the Print dialog each time we print. If we
forget, the document is printed on the letterhead paper we have in the
250-sheet cassette.

Any ideas?

Specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  Some highlights are...
32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers 
& 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8K copyback capable caches,
4-way set associative.  Typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5
clocks for a floating point multiply.

(interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point
numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)

>2) Specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...

More of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  Figure
about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  But the Motorola
guys are pretty bright, it may be less.

Call Motorola.  I'm not typing it all in.

>I am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.

I'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
ends.  New experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can
schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  That sort
of trick can't really be done with CISC architectures.

I finally saw some details on the 586/Pentium and was not greatly
impressed.  They've finally done some work on the FPU to get it up to
speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  And to get
that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch
target buffer.  Yes, I know they're talking about 100MHz processors.
Big whoop.  Designing a 100MHz board is difficult and really
expensive.  Priced 15ns memory chips lately?

Reply-To: rogntorb@idt.unit.no (Torbj|rn Rognes)

Lines: 32

I haven't seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good
advice.

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,
and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB
disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some
problems:

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them
installed in the other disk.

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won't boot of the hard disk.

Thank you!

 ==================== 
 I HAVE A QUESTION...  (1.0)
 ====================
  
       Congratulations!  You've come to the right place.  Usenet is 
  a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
  (How do I lock a floppy disk?) to queries that would make Steve
  Jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror.  (I used
  ResEdit to remove resources Init #11, WDEF 34, and nVIR 17 from my
  system file and used the Hex Editor to add code string #A67B45 as a
  patch to the SFGetFile routine so the Standard File Dialog Box
  would be a nice shade of mauve.  Everything worked fine until I
  installed SuperCDevBlaster, and now when I use the Aldus driver to
  print from PageMaker 5.0d4 to a Linotronic 6000 my system hangs. 
  P.S.  I'm running System 6.0.2 on a PowerBook 170.) 
  
       Since the Macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume, we
  ask that you first peruse this FAQ list including at least the
  table of contents for the other pieces of it, check any other
  relevant on-line resources listed below in question 1.2, especially
  the FAQ lists for the other Macintosh newsgroups, and RTFM (Read
  the Friendly Manual) before posting your question.  We realize that
  you are personally incensed that the System is taking up fourteen
  of your newly-installed twenty megs of RAM, but this question has
  already made its way around the world three hundred times before,
  and it's developing tired feet.  Finally, before posting to any
  newsgroup (Macintosh or otherwise), please familiarize yourself
  with the basic etiquette of Usenet as described in the newsgroup
  news.announce.newusers.


 HOW DO I USE THIS DOCUMENT?  WHERE CAN I GET IT?  (1.1) 
     
         comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces,
  a general introduction which you're reading now, and specific lists
  for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc.  FAQ
  lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted, comp.sys.mac.apps and
  comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development.  When ready each part
  will be available in its respective newsgroup.  All pieces are
  available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the
  pub/usenet/news.answers/macintosh directory. Except for this
  document itself which is named general-faq.Z the pieces are named
  as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover  followed by
  ""-faq"", e.g. system-faq.Z, misc-faq.Z.  The .Z means the  file is
  stored compressed so you'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
  either MacCompress, StuffIt Deluxe, or the UNIX uncompress command 
  to decompress it.  However if you leave off the "".Z"" extension when
   you ""get"" the file, rtfm will automatically decompress the file
  before sending it to you. 
  
         This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
  newsgroups.  The tables of contents for each of the specific FAQ
  lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
  get  at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
  else in the FAQ even if you don't have the other parts at hand. 
  It's not always obvious, especially to newcomers, where a
  particular question or comment should be posted.  Please
  familiarize yourself with the FAQ lists in all the major Macintosh
  newsgroups before posting in any of them.  Which questions appear
  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
  where. 
  
         To jump to a particular question search for
  section-number.question-number enclosed in parentheses.  For
  example to find ""Where can I FTP Macintosh software?"" search for
  the string  ""(2.1)"".  To jump to a section instead of a question
  use a zero for  the question number.


 WHAT OTHER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?  (1.2)

      comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of 
  frequently asked questions appropriate for the Usenet newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system.  Four other files are
  worthy of particular note: Daryl Spitzer maintains a FAQ list
  covering Macintosh programming for the newsgroup
  comp.sys.mac.programmer.  It's posted to that group weekly and 
  available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in 
  /pub/mac.  Eric Rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list 
  for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from
  rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac/faq (where the file you're reading now
  is also irregularly archived).  This list answers many frequently
  asked questions about networking, UNIX and the Mac,
  telecommunications, and foreign file formats.  Norm Walsh has
  compiled an excellent FAQ for comp.fonts that answers a lot of
  questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross-platform
  conversion and printing.  It's available in comp.fonts or by ftp
  from ibis.cs.umass.edu in /pub/norm/comp.fonts/FAQ*.  Finally Jim
  Jagielski maintains a FAQ for comp.unix.aux covering Apple's UNIX
  environment, A/UX.  It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux
  and news.answers. It's available for anonymous ftp at
  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.


 WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?  (1.3)
  
      There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones. 
  You wouldn't ask your English teacher how to do the definite
  integral  of ln x between zero and one, would you?  So don't ask
  the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when Microsoft
  Word is in the background.  Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
  excuse. If you want people to help you, you need to learn their
  ways of  communicating.  
  
      Posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
  mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too
  :-) ).  Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
  silence.  For instance the most common and glaring mispost, one
  that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the Macintosh regions of
  Usenet as would a purple elephant to Aleuts in the Arctic, asking a
  question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm,
  normally produces no useful responses.  Posting the same question
  to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered
  by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
  network software designers.
  
         Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.  Do not cross-post. 
  If a question isn't important enough for you to take the extra
  minute to figure out where it properly belongs, it's not important
  enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading. 
  For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a
  catch-all newsgroup.
  
         The breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
  this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
  where.  Specifically questions about productivity applications
  (software you bought your Macintosh to run, not software you bought
  to make your Macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps
  unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup. 
  Communications programs, games, HyperCard, compilers and databases
  all have more topical comp.sys.mac.* newsgroups.  Post questions
  about non-communications hardware including questions about what
  software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
  comp.sys.mac.hardware.  Questions about MacOS system software
  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.  Questions about utilities and
  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.  Questions about
  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.  Detailed questions about Appletalk
  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.
  
         Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard. 
  Non-HyperCard programming questions and questions about development
  environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer.  ResEdit
  questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc,
  comp.sys.mac.system, or comp.sys.mac.programmer; but generally the
  netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer
  are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking. 
  
         A general exception to the above rules is that any VERY
  technical question about an application that actually begins to
  delve into the how's of a program as well as the what's (Recent
  example: How does WriteNow which is written entirely in assembly
  compare to other word processors written in high level languages?)
  might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.
    
         For Sale and Want to Buy posts should go to
  comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac ONLY.  We
  understand that you're desperate to sell your upgraded 128K Mac to
  get the $$ for a PowerBook 180; but trust me, anyone who wants to
  buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted.  Political and
  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows! Is not! Is
  too! Is not! Is too! Hey! How 'bout the Amiga! What about it? Is
  Not! Is too!) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.  Anything not
  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.
  
         Finally don't be so provincial as to consider only the
  comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions. 
  Many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more
  thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems.  Questions about Mac MIDI
  are often better handled in comp.music even though it's not a
  Macintosh specific newsgroup.  Shop around.  Usenet's a big place
  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in
  comp.sys.mac.


 4. SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF
 THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.  SHOULDN'T I PUT MY BRILLIANCE AND
 WIT ON  DISPLAY FOR THE WORLD BY POSTING THE SEVENTEENTH RESPONSE?

      No.  Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
  frequent questions.  Unless you really have something new to add to
  the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in
  System 7.1 could eat memory) private E-mail is a much better medium
  for answering common questions like this one.
   
         You might want to add a mention of this FAQ in your E-mail
  response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
  before posting future questions.  I do read all the newsgroups
  covered here and have written a small script in MicroPhone II that
  lets me send PWFAQ's (people with frequently asked questions) the
  section of this document that answers their question with just the
  click of a button so please don't feel obligated to respond to
  someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
  can't be troubled to read the FAQ list to get it.

 FTP  (2.0)

 WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?  (2.1)

      The three major North American Internet archives of shareware,
  freeware, and demo software are sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6),
  mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41), and wuarchive.wustl.edu
  (128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several
  others. Wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
  them for space concerns, and still has files that were deleted from
  the formerly important site, rascal.ics.utexas.edu.  Rascal was
  notable for storing its files in MacBinary format rather than the
  less efficient BinHex format common at the other archives.  Unless
  otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
  should be available at the above sites.
  
       To keep traffic on the Internet manageable, Scandinavians 
  should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100), ftp.lth.se
  (130.235.20.3), or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead.  Those in 
  the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1). 
  Continental Europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40),  
  ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72), and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1). 
  Australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au
  (139.130.4.6) which mirrors info-mac and mac.archive.  Japanese
  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp
  (130.69.254.254). 

         A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3). 
  This is Apple's semi-official repository for system software,
  developer tools, source code, technical notes, and other things
  that come more or less straight from Apple's mouth.  Some material
  at this site may not be distributed outside the U.S. or by other
  sites that don't have an official license to distribute Apple
  system software.  Please read the various README documents
  available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you're
  connecting from outside the U.S. or if you wish to redistribute
  material you find here.


 CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?  (2.2)

      The info-mac archives at sumex-aim are available by E-mail from
  LISTSERV@RICEVM1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu). 
  The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH
  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.  Mac archive files are available
  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.  Send it a message containing the
  words ""help"" and ""index"" (no quotes) on the first two lines of your
  message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
  you may request.  You can retrieve files from other sites by using
  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  For details send it a
  message with just the text ""help"" (no quotes).


 WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?  (2.3)

      If you can't find what you're looking for at one of the above
  sites, try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
  an E-mail message addressed to archie with the subject ""help."" 
  Archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15,
  America), archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3, the original archie server
  in Canada), archie.au (139.130.4.6, Australia), archie.funet.fi
  (128.214.6.100, Scandinavia), and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7,
  the U.K. and the continent).  These sites index the tens of
  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.  Login as ""archie""
  (no password is needed) and type ""prog filename"" to find what
  you're looking for or type ""help"" for more detailed instructions. 
  For instance you would type ""prog Disinfectant"" to search for a
  convenient ftp site for Disinfectant.  If the initial search fails
  to turn up the file you want, try variations on and substrings of
  the name.  For instance if you didn't find Disinfectant with ""prog
  Disinfectant"", you might try ""prog disi"" instead.  Substring
  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.  To avoid many
  erroneous matches add a "".*\.hqx"" to the end of the substring, e.g.
  ""prog disi.*\.hqx""  Most Mac software available on the net ends in
  .hqx but almost no UNIX or PC software does. 

         Please check the above archives and ARCHIE personally BEFORE
  asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware.  If you
  follow the above advice, you should almost never have to ask the
  net where to find a particular piece of software.


 CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?  (2.4)

      No.  Nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
  comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site.  Please
  refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
  anonymous FTP, archie, and automatic E-mail servers.


 WHAT IS .BIN? .HQX? .CPT? .ETC?  (2.5)

      Most files available by FTP are modified twice to allow them to
  more easily pass through foreign computer systems.  First they're
  compressed to make them faster to download, and then they're
  translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary (.bin) format
  that other computers can digest.  (The Macintosh uses a special
  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)  BinHex
  files are 7-bit ASCII text files, while MacBinary files are pure
  8-bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
  protocol.
  
         How a file has been translated and compressed for
  transmission is indicated by its suffix.  Normally a file will have
  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.  .xxx indicates how it was
  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.  To use a file
  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the
  process.  Most files you get from the net require a two-step
  decoding process.  First change the binhex (.hqx) or MacBinary
  (.bin) file to a double-clickable Macintosh file; then decompress
  it.  Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
  below.  Also note that most Macintosh telecommunications programs
  will  automatically convert MacBinary files to regular Macintosh
  files as they are downloaded.

***************************************************************************

     A few notes on the decompressors:

      StuffIt is a family of products that use several different
  compression schemes.  The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff
  all of them.  Versions of StuffIt earlier than 3.0 (StuffIt 1.5.1,
  StuffIt Classic, UnStuffIt, and StuffIt Deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will
  not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by StuffIt 3.0. 
  You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt
  Expander. 
    
         StuffIt 3.0.5 (Lite and Deluxe) consistently makes smaller
  archives than any other Macintosh compression utility.  To allow
  maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
  net-bandwidth down, please compress all files you send to anonymous
  ftp sites with StuffIt 3.0.5.
   
         UUTool, MacCompress, and SunTar handle the popular UNIX
  formats of  uuencode (.uu), compress (.Z), and tar (.tar)
  respectively.  The UNIX versions are often more robust than the Mac
  products, so use them instead when that's an  option.  Translators
  that allow StuffIt Lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
  available by anonymous ftp. 
  
         Macutil is dik winter's package of UNIX utilities to
  decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
  them to a Mac. Since UNIX stores files differently than does the
  Mac, macutil creates MacBinary (.bin) files which should be
  automatically converted on download.  It can't decompress
  everything. In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0
  archives. :-(  However, if you need only one or two files out of an
  archive--for instance if you want to read the README to find out if
  a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
  it--macutil is indispensable.  It can be found at sumex-aim in the
  info-mac/unix directory.

     A few notes on the compression formats:

      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.  Always use a binary file
  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text. 
  Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.  Only rascal
  stores most of its files in .bin format.  Most communications
  programs such as ZTerm and MacKermit are capable of translating
  MacBinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
  they'll be downloading MacBinary files.
  
      .image: This format is normally used only for system software,
  so that on-line users can download files that can easily be
  converted into exact copies of the installer floppies.  Instead of
  using DiskCopy to restore the images to floppies, you can use Steve
  Christensen's freeware utility  MountImage to treat the images on
  your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive. 
  MountImage has a reputation for being buggy, so you should have
  some blank floppies and a copy of DiskCopy handy just in case.
  
      .sea (.x, .X):  .sea files don't merit a position in the above
  table because they're self-extracting.  They may have been created
  with Compact Pro, StuffIt, or even DiskDoubler; but all should be
  capable of decompressing themselves when double-clicked.  For some
  unknown reason Alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard
  designation for self-extracting archives created with their 
  payware products SuperDisk! and More Disk Space.  Instead they 
  append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.


 HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?  STUFFIT?  ETC.?  (2.6)

      By far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
  being to copy them onto a floppy for you.  If you're at a
  university there's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
  give you a copy; and if you're anywhere less remote than McMurdo
  Sound, chances are very good that someone at a computer center,
  dealership, or user group can provide you with a copy of StuffIt. 
  Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.
    
         If you're such a computer geek that the thought of actually
  asking a living, breathing human being instead of a computer 
  terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of 
  protoplasmic jelly, you can probably download a working copy  of
  StuffIt from a local bulletin board system. 
  
         If you have religious objections to software gotten by any 
  means other than anonymous ftp, then I suppose I'll mention that 
  you can in fact ftp a working copy of StuffIt though this is by 
  far the hardest way to get it.  Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and 
  login.  Type the word ""binary.""  Hit return.  Type ""cd
  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression"" and hit return.  Then
  ""get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin""  and hit return.  Of course
  it's always possible that by the time you read this StuffIt
  Expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
  fails look for something similar.  If you've ftp'd straight onto
  your Mac you should now have a self-extracting archive which will
  produce a working copy of StuffIt Expander when double-clicked.  If
  you've ftp'd to your mainframe or UNIX account first, you still
  need to use a modem program to download it to your Mac.  Just make
  sure that the Mac is receiving in MacBinary mode and the mainframe
  is sending in binary mode.  If you need more details on the last
  step, consult the FAQ list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals
  for both your mainframe and Macintosh telecommunications software.
  
  
  HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC. FROM A PC?  (2.7)

       You can't.  There is absolutely NO way to get an executable
  Macintosh file from an ftp site onto a PC and then onto your Mac
  without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.
  You MUST beg, borrow, or steal the necessary software such as
  Binhex or StuffIt Lite from another person.  I realize this may 
  terrify those among you who haven't left your parents' basement 
  since you got an  Apple II+ in 1980, but eventually you're going 
  to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.  
  (though I suppose if you're this much of  a nerd you could send 
  your mother out to get it for you.)  While you're gathering
  your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world 
  of daylight, please don't bother the net by asking this question
  again.  There simply is no way to move executable Macintosh
  programs from a PC or other non-Macintosh computer onto a 
  Mac without software that is not bundled with most Macs.



=================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING: WHAT TO DO (BEFORE POSTING) WHEN THINGS GO WRONG (3.0)
================================================================= 

         While the various FAQ lists cover a lot of specific
  problems, there are far more problems that aren't covered here. 
  These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
  for help.  You should probably also perform the ten-step
  preventative maintenance routine described in section four,
  especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system
  heap (4.5).  Following these steps may  or may not solve your
  problem, but it will at least make it easier  for others to
  recommend solutions to you.

 IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.  (3.1)

      ""Microsoft Word is crashing"" doesn't say much.  What were you
  doing when it crashed?  Can you repeat the actions that lead to the
  crash?  The more information you provide about the actions
  preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you. 
  The more precisely you've identified the problem and the actions
  preceding it (Step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the
  following steps fix the problem.  For example, ""Sometimes
  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error."" is
  not nearly as helpful as ""QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes when I link two
  text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
  contain text.""  The former will leave you wondering whether the bug
  remains after a given step.  The latter lets you go right to the
  problem and see if it's still there or not.


 READ THE READ ME FILE.  (3.2)

      Many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
  bugs in their READ ME files.  Often these aren't documented in the
  manual. Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound
  familiar.


 CHECK FOR VIRUSES.  (3.3)

      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.  Virus
  infections are rarer than most people think, but they do occur and
  they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.


 REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.  (3.4)  
   
       For half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields,
  improperly written software, the alignment of the planets) a file
  on a disk may not contain the data it's supposed to contain.  This
  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.  Restoring
  from original masters will normally fix this.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.  (3.5)  

      Bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
  than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous. 
  See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean
  reinstall. 
  
         If the problem continues to occur after you've taken these
  steps, chances are you've found either a conflict between your
  application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
  program.  So it's time to


 ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.  (3.6)  
 
         You need to find the minimal system on which the problem
  will assert itself.  Here are the basic steps of isolating the
  cause of a system or application crash:
  
     a.	Run only one application at a time. Occasionally applications do
     conflict with each other.  If the problem does not manifest itself
     without other applications running simultaneously, you can begin
     launching other applications until you find the one that causes 
     the crash.
     
     b.	If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.  If you're
     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you 
     can afford.  Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially 
     when performing complicated operations.
     
     c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit
     addressing.  There's still an awful lot of System 7 hostile
     software out there including some from companies that really 
     have no excuse.  (Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?  
     I knew you could.)  Some of this software only expresses its 
     incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.
     
     d.	Boot from a virgin system floppy.  If the problem disappears
     you likely have an init conflict.  You need to progressively remove
     extensions until the problem vanishes.  Use a little common sense
     when choosing the first extensions to remove.  If the problem occurs
     when you try to open a file, remove any inits that mess with the
     Standard File Open procedure such as Super Boomerang first.  If the
     problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated,
     either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or, if you have
     a lot of them, perform a binary search by removing half of the
     extensions at a time.  Once the problem disappears add half of the
     most recently removed set back.  Continue until you've narrowed the
     conflict down to one extension.  When you think you've found the
     offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make 
     sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.


 CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  (3.7)

      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why
  the conflict occurs.  If a tech support number is available for the
  software, call it.  If you're lucky the company will have a work
  around or fix available.  If not, perhaps they'll at least add the
  bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.

    

 ====================== 
 PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE  (4.0)
 ======================

      You wouldn't drive your car 100,000 miles without giving it a
  tune-up.  A computer is no different.  Regular tune-ups avoid a lot
  of problems.  Although there are Mac mechanics who'll be happy to
  charge you $75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change, there's
  no reason you can't change it yourself.  The following nine-step
  program should be performed about every three months. 


 TRASH UNNEEDED FILES  (4.1)

      Many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
  smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
  little time cleaning up your hard disk.  If you're at all like me,
  you'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
  applications you no longer have, archives of software you've
  dearchived, shareware you tried out and didn't like, announcements
  for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
  longer need.  If you're running System 7 you may also have several
  more megabytes in your trash can alone.  Throw them away and empty 
  the trash.


 RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)

      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain. 
  Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension 
  in your collection.  If you don't use the functionality of an
  extension at least every fifth time you boot up, you're probably
  better off not storing it in your System Folder where it only takes
  up memory, destabilizes your system, and slows down every startup. 
  For instance if you only read PC disks once a month, there's no
  need to keep AccessPC loaded all the time.  Cutting back on your
  extension habit can really help avoid crashes. 


 REBUILD THE DESKTOP  (4.3)

      The Desktop file/database holds all the information necessary
  to associate each file with the application that created it.  It
  lets the system know what application should be launched when you
  open a given file and what icons it should display where. 
  Depending on its size each application has one or more
  representatives in the desktop file.  As applications and files
  move on and off your hard disk, the Desktop file can be become
  bloated and corrupt.  Think of it as a Congress for your Mac. 
  Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with
  a clean slate.  Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than
  to defeat an incumbent. 
  
         One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.  Under System 7 Maurice
  Volaski's freeware init CommentKeeper will retain those comments
  across a rebuild.  CommentKeeper also works with System 6 but only 
  if Apple's Desktop Manager extension is also installed. 
  
         To rebuild the desktop restart your Mac and, as your
  extensions finish loading, depress the Command and Option keys. 
  You'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
  the desktop and warning you that ""This could take a few minutes."" 
  Click OK. It will take more than a few minutes. The more files you
  have the longer it will take.  If you're running System 6 you may
  want to turn off MultiFinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.
   
          If you're experiencing definite problems and not just doing
  preventive maintenance, you may want to use Fifth Generation's
  freeware init Desktop Reset.  Desktop Reset completely deletes the
  Desktop file before rebuilding it, thus eliminating possibly
  corrupt data structures.    


 ZAP THE PRAM AND RESET THE CLOCK  (4.4)

      All Macs from the original 128K Thin Mac to the Quadra 950
  contain a small amount of battery powered RAM to hold certain
  settings that properly move with the CPU rather than with the disk
  such as which disk to boot from.  Unfortunately this ""parameter
  RAM"" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.  To reset
  it under System 7 hold down the Command, Option, P, and R keys
  while restarting your Mac.  Under System 6 hold down the Command,
  Option, and Shift keys while selecting the Control Panel from the
  Apple menu. Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
  RAM.  Since you've erased almost all the settings in the General
  Control Panel, you should now reset them to whatever you want.
   
         The one setting that zapping the PRAM does not erase is the 
  date and time; but since the internal clock in the Macintosh is
  notoriously inaccurate you'll probably want to take this
  opportunity to reset it anyway.


 RESIZE THE SYSTEM HEAP  (4.5) 

      Even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
  people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
  bottom of their screen every time they restart.  All these
  extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of
  memory called the System Heap.  If the System Heap isn't big enough
  to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
  it, they all start playing King of the Mountain on the system heap,
  knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
  trying to climb back on after they get knocked off.  All this
  fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
  and almost inevitably crashes the Mac.
  
         If you're using System 7, your Macintosh will automatically
  resize the system heap as necessary; but if you're running System 6
  it's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
  all your extensions and applications.  By default this size is set
  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all. 
  The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot
  blocks of every system disk.  Bill Steinberg's freeware utility
  BootMan not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
  how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
  needs to be allocated.  If you're running System 6, get BootMan,
  use it, and be amazed at how infrequently your Macintosh crashes.


 REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE  (4.6)

      System files can become corrupt and fragmented, especially if
  you've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them. 
  Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file
  corruption.  I recommend doing a clean reinstall.  Here's how:

    1.  Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.  
    2.  Copy any non-standard fonts and desk accessories out 
        of your System file into a temporary suitcase.
    3.  Trash the System file on your hard disk.  Also trash the 
        Finder, MultiFinder, DA Handler, and all other standard Apple 
        extensions like Control Panel and Chooser.  These will all be 
        replaced in the new installation.  If you're running or 
        installing System 7, move everything in the Extensions, 
        Control Panels, and Preferences folders into the top level 
        of the System Folder.
    4.  Rename the System Folder.  Any name other than System Folder 
        is  fine.
    5.  Double-click the installer script on your System disk.  Then 
        choose Customize...  Select the appropriate software for your 
        model Mac and printer.  You could do an Easy Install instead, 
        but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you don't 
        need that waste your memory and disk space.
    6.  Once installation is finished, move everything from the 
        temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new System 
        folder.  If you're asked if you want to replace anything, you 
        forgot to take something out in step 3.  You'll need to replace 
        things individually until you find the duplicate piece. 
    7.  Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.
    8.  Reboot.  You should now have a clean, defragmented System file 
        that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable 
        system overall.


     DISK UTILITIES  (4.7)

      Much like system files hard disks have data structures that
  occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
  causing data loss.  Apple includes Disk First Aid, a simple utility
  for detecting and repairing hard disk problems, with its System
  disks. It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in
  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.  Even if you have an earlier 
  version, you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com
  and run it on all your hard disks.
     
         Several companies have released payware disk utilities that
  detect and repair considerably more problems than Disk First Aid
  though, interestingly, none of them detect and repair everything
  that Disk First Aid does.  The three most effective for general
  work are Central Point's MacTools Deluxe 2.0, Fifth Generation's
  Public Utilites, and Symantec's Norton Utilities for the Macintosh
  2.0.  A department or work group should have all of these as well
  as Disk First Aid since none of them fix everything the others do. 
  For individuals MacTools ($48 street) is about half the price of
  Norton ($94 street) or Public Utilities ($98 street) so, features
  and ease of use being roughly equal, I recommend MacTools.
   
         All of these products occasionally encounter problems they
  can't fix.  When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and
  reformat (4.9).


     BACKING UP  (4.8)

      This is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
  done a LOT more often than every three months.  The simplest back
  up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
  or other removable media.  If you keep your data files separate
  from your application and support files then it's easy to only back
  up those folders which change frequently.  Nonetheless every three
  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk. 
  
         A number of programs are available to make backing up
  easier.  Apple included a very basic full backup application with
  System 6.  With the Performas Apple ships a new Apple Backup
  utility that can backup the entire disk or just the System folder
  onto floppies.  The previously mentioned Norton Utilities for the
  Mac and MacTools Deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup
  utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.
  
         Finally if you're lucky enough to have a Tape Drive, network
  server, or removable media device to use for backups, you should
  check out the more powerful payware utilities Redux ($49 street,
  doesn't support tape drives) and Diskfit Pro ($74 street).  There
  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD
  Backup from System 6.  


 DISK DEFRAGMENTATION  (4.9)

      As disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
  space in the same place to write large files.  Therefore the
  operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
  stored in different places on your hard disk.  As files become more
  and more fragmented performance can degrade.  There are several
  ways to defragment a hard disk.
  
         The most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
  files, erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while
  you're at it.  See question 4.10.), and restore all the files.
   
         A number of payware utilities including Norton Utilities for
  the Mac and Mac Tools Deluxe can defragment a disk in place, i.e.
  without erasing it.  Although the ads for all these products brag
  about their safety, once you've bought the software and opened the
  shrink-wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
  defragmenting it in case something does go wrong.  There are NO
  freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please don't annoy the
  net by asking for one. 


 REFORMAT YOUR HARD DISK  (4.10)

      Just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use, so a
  hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data.  You don't
  need to reformat every three months; but when your system is
  crashing no matter what you try, reformatting is the ultimate means
  of wiping the slate clean.  Reformatting your hard disk may even
  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.  Not all hard disks are
  created equal.  Some can hold more data than others.  To facilitate
  mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks (* 81.3
  megabytes is the average formatted capacity.  Your mileage may
  vary.)  Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
  of drive capacity.  When you reformat there's no reason at all not
  to reclaim whatever unused space Apple's left on your disk.
     
         Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
  initialize them. Most hard disks come with formatting software. 
  Apple's disks and System software ship with HD SC setup, a minimal
  disk formatter which will format Apple brand hard drives ONLY. 
  Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
  their hard drives.  Normally this will be all you need to reformat
  your hard disk.
  
         A number of general-purpose formatters are also available
  which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
  encryption, password protection, multiple partitioning, faster disk
  access, System 7 compatibility, and even compression.  Two of the
  best are the payware Drive7 and Hard Disk Toolkit Personal Edition
  ($49 street for either).  While there are one or two freeware
  formatters available, none are likely to be superior to the ones
  bundled with your hard disk. 
  
         PowerBook users should be sure to turn off Sleep and
  processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
  what software they use.  Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and
  data losses are a very good possibility.

			  While there may not be a part number for the CD300i drive, I have seen
a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it
through which you insert the CD). The document (which I got from the
2/10/93 announcement at our Apple office) states the drive kit and bezel
kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an SRP of $149 fro the C650.
The external unit may be a better deal after all.

Sorry, I assumed that the the various new machines with the internal

I can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under

I skip over all the quoted material, since I've already read it, and look 
for the non-quoted material, and all I get is the name addition.  Is this 
supposed to me ""I agree"", or ""I second this"" or what?

Sorry...

Hello Mr. Au,

I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong. The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin


e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.

Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.

Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.

Subject: Adapter Cable for VGA Monitors
Lines: 51

Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according to
Apple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's
160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter does
not do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal into
the correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.

Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??

The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assuming
that the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);


Macintosh LC to VGA
 
The Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGA
monitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to
16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supported
to 256 colors.
 
Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL level
          inputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not work
          with the Macintosh LC.
 
To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cable
from the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is the
pinout description for the adapter cable:
 
Macintosh LC        VGA
Video Connector     Pin     Signal Name
---------------     ----    -----------
1                   6       Red ground
2                   1       Red video signal
5                   2       Green video signal
6                   7       Green ground
9                   3       Blue video signal
13                  8       Blue ground
15                  13      /HSYNC
12                  14      /VSYNC
14                  10      HSYNC ground
7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied together
 
VGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LC
video connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, which
results in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGA
monitor.

  Yes, E-Machines makes two mini-docks--the Powerlink Presente and the
PowerLink DeskNet. The Presenter offers a variety of video-out options, 
including NTSC, RGB and SVGA. It also has sound out, floppy drive port
and a power port. Unfortunately no SCSI port and it blocks the serial port.
  The DeskNet has the standard ports plus built-in EtherNet. Alas, none of
these have an FPU.
  In the future, RasterOps is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes
me now. It is supposed to support 16-bit color and ""Quadra"" comparable
video speed. No idea if it has an FPU.
  Hope this helps...

I think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
on its side.  The point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'
drives, namely 1/3 ht LPS drives that have a smaller platter and are also
more stable.
	Why should I take the chance?  Because I've been running a Maxtor 1/3 ht
120 LPS on both its side and flat for about a year and I've had no
problems with it.  Period.

To boorishly reply to myself, I found I did have the Instrutech information
already. The specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:

A/D: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 kHz, 12 bit accuracy to
200 kHz. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. There are 8 multiplexed
inputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the
same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate
must be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits
at 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national
Instruments, at the same sample rate.

D/A: 16 bit converter. No specs for S/N, monotonicity, linearity. Each of
the 4 output channels has its own converter.

The price for the external converter box (the ITC-16), the NuBus interface
board (the MAC-23), plus C driver software and Igor XOP's is $2695. Rather
steep.

A week or so ago, I posted about a problem with my SE/30:  I have 20 megs

(total of all extensions) then my system will crash before the finder
comes up.  What I meant was having a large amount of fonts load, or
sounds, or huge disk caches with a control panel other than Apple's
memory control panel.  Apple's cache is at 64K, mode 32 is on, and
so is 32 bit addressing.  All extensions work by themselves or with the
others until I increase the memory used by some of them (with methods
mentioned above).

Well, here's my latest followup...  I ran NOWs System Profile and got
this information:

Note that 32 bit System zone is absent.  Could this be the problem?

I don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the Mac Superdrive can  
read MS-DOS disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the NeXT and  
a Mac by using MS-DOS formatted disks since the NeXT *can* read/write that  
format.  And if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it  
over the serial port using kermit.

Well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:

""Why would Apple release a Duo Dock with a processor of its own?""

Here's why- People have hounded Apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
in it. Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. How
does one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existing
PowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple a
unique ability to give users that 040 power in a ""Semi-Portable"" fashion.
By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got ""quadra"" power at your desk.
On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.
Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor in
parallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypothetical
now...

Subject: Cannot move data fast enough!?
Summary: disk -> buffer -> network card
Keywords: NuBus, SCSI, disk, throughput
Organization: Gokuraku Videos
Lines: 43

I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / sec
for very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)

I have a Quadra 950. 
I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.
         (using block-mode transfers)
I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can
         achieve 6.8 MB/s.

Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.

It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,
then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/s
result in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)

So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, 

Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.
Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.
Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.
        ...
Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.
Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.

Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,
and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')
each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers were
executed one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.

Why?

Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can both
access data at the same time.)
Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to use
the same bus to mac RAM?

Is there anything I can do?

As a side note, in that same ad (MacWorld 6/93), they are selling the 50MHz
Powercache for the IIsi with FPU for $575. For those thinking of upgrading
to the 040 33 MHz Turbo (an upgrade costs $600 direct from Daystar), this comes
out to $1175, about $200 cheaper than what most mail-order companies charge.

For the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  I've got a Computer Engineering
degree, yet I've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use.  Moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; I received 3 job offers
upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
$7000/year lower!  My advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.

You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Put
it at a convenient number like ""1"".  You *could* cut a hole in the
back of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through the
hassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID of
your internal drive.

Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concerned
too.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just fine
with the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM
SIMMs, though.

You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple
dealer.  The relevant parts are:

  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate
  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25"" device mounting bracket]

Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to
mount a 5.25"" device.  The service techs I talked to said, ""Oh sure,
we stock those.""  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to
hold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.

As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already
cut out for a standard 5.25"" device.  (Why not?  They advertise
these machines as being able to accept any standard device in the
5.25"" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for
their CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.

I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my
tape drive, which is a standard 5.25"" device.

Good luck with your SyQuest.

Subject: updated keyboard question for the plus
Organization: Illinois State University
Lines: 44

I have an old Mac Plus. A couple of years ago I bought a shiney new lc.
It came with apple's new keyboard (with abd ports). i replaced it with
a mac-pro-plus extended keyboard (which i thoroughly enjoy, thank you
very much).
 
well, i have this extra keyboard which i would like to use on the plus
but there's a little problem. the plus uses an rj-11 jack for keyboard
input and the new keyboards don't. i got an extra adb cable from my
local apple dealer (they're such nice people), but they couldn't tell
me the order of the wires.
 
there are four wires in the adb cables: black, white, red, tan. I know
one's a ground, one gets the serial signal, one supplies 5 volts, and
i forgot what the fourth one does. anyway, if you hook them up wrong
you'll fry a board and i <really> don't want to do <that>.
 
if any brave souls out there have done this before, please e-mail your
experience directly to me. i would greatly appreciate it especially
since apple's original keyboard is not . . . ergonomically correct.
 
btw, i did take apart my new keyboard to see if i could find the
correlation between the wires for the rj-11 jack and the adb since it
has both, but no such luck (the connections are soldered inside of
little boxes). Oh, well . . .
 
one more thing: in case you are thinking that the ABD ports on the
newer models are different from the connection used on the plus---
you're right. however, you can use the telephone cable from the plus
and connect the mac-pro-plus keyboard via its own rj-11 jack. in
other words, this little engineering feat i wish to do *is* possible.
it's merely a matter of finding out the correct order.
 
omt, when i get this to work, i definitely will post the solution
so others can, too. thanx for the input.

Subject: Can I remove the 68000 under my daughterboard upgrade?
Organization: Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.
Lines: 26

The subject says what I would like to do, here are the details:

I have a 512ke with the MacRescue upgrade board that makes it the
equivalent of a Plus (System 7 and MacEnvy both identify it as such).

The MacRescue board clips onto the 68000 on the MB.  It also has
a 68000 itself.  Periodically I have to remove the clip (not an
entirely easy thing to do) and clean the ""legs"" of the 68000.
Larry Pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
snap on upgrades:  the 68000's ""legs"" will oxidize, causing 
unusual system errors.

Well, that's me.

So, I would like to do something permanent, and I think it would be
fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and
modify the MacRescue board to plug in.  What I'm not 100% sure of
is whether it will work.  It seems to me that the two 68000s aren't
acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
the performance of my Mac.  I'm about 97% sure.

Will someone provide the extra 3%?

I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25""
mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. First
there seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can't
figure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on the
bottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?

Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There are
a lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.

Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things to
work and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy was
troublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset on
the MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back on
agian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.

Please reply to one of the email addresses below.

Yes, but if you upgrade the VRAM in a 900 you get 24 bit color.  So
you really don't care.  My point is that out the box the 950 has
more video capability for the same size monitors.  The 900 can
do 24 bit with both 13"" and 16"", doesn't support 19"", and
does 8 bit on 21"" monitors.

Sorry about the misinformation.  I made a bad assumption about
the new machines behaving like a Quadra 900, see previous
post.  About sampling the CD audio though, have you tried it?  I 
found the aliasing to be really bad.  Like it needed a filter or something.
Much worse than I expected.  I installed the CD-300 in the

Yes, it is possible to add a second hard drive to a mac IIcx internally. This
is definitely not a recommended procedure by Apple but I have done the equivalent to my CX after upgrading it to a Quadra 700. The power supply is still the
stock CX's and it was able to power two Quantum LPS drives, a PLI SCSI 
accelerator, a Micron technologies 24 bit video board, Daystar QuickCache,
New Technologies Overdrive and 20 meg of RAM simultaneously.

I added a new mount for the drive by attaching angle brackets to the drive
tower. The internal SCSI cable was changed to a longer flat ribbon cable onto
which I added an extra connector about midway. The final HD was internally
terminated and the drive between the motherboard and final HD had its terminator resistor packs removed. Cooling has not been a problem and no SCSI problems
occur with either the PLI SCSI chain or motherboard SCSI hooked into the two
internal hard drives.

It works very well for me, but proceed cautiously if you wish to do the same.

------ X-posted to comp.sys.mac.hardware and misc.consumers -------

You've heard about Apple's great new customer ""support"" program.  Well,
think again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple
computer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:

In the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort
by Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple's attention a problem with
certain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice ""stick"" in
the down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the
machine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the
reported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of
BCGA65431. You'll recognize this ""sticky button"" symptom immediately if you
have such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it's not subtle.

Liam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead 
suggested that people contact Apple's Customer Assistance Center directly
(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described
my defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told
Apple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of
warranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering
where my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the
serial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)
range Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.

Nothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make
it worth Apple's while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.
Please, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don't assume you
know what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start
hacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.
Please take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:

                  United States      1-800-776-2333
                  Canada             800-665-2775
                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01
                  Australia          61-2-452-8000
                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500

If the number isn't toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask
for a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register
the details of your case, including your mouse's serial number.  Be firm.

Network managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user
bases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don't send mail to
me or post yet another ""sticky-button"" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If
enough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple
will eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy
to stone-wall on this issue, don't expect them to offer support when the
next, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.

FWB distributes HDT Personal Edition (HDT = Hard Drive Toolkit), which
is what I own. This is less fancy than the ""full"" version, but good
enough for what you and I want to do. Casa Blanca offers Drive7, but
I'm not that familiar with it. I *think* that both Drive7 and HDT PE
can be had for around US$50.

I've used Silverlinging at work (v 5.42??), and I like HDT PE much
better. IMHO it has a better interface, and easier to understand.

Any Drive7 users?

So, will it be possible to have a NuBus or PDS PowerPC upgrade, or will it 
require a logic board swap? It would be interesting for Apple to come out with
a NuBus PowerPC that allowed use of the CPU's 680x0, like RocketShare. But I 
guess that's getting a bit fantastic!

I was wondering, since MacWeek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
PowerPCs on a NuBus card.

Also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? Last I heard, the 
estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a Quadra in native RISC mode. I
heard an Apple employee mumble something about the arrival of PowerPC machines
at a much earlier date that Q1 94, but I doubt it's true.

Finally, is the PowerPC developer's CD 'mini-course' available? I saw it 
advertised in the developer's university calendar, and I'd like to know if it's
at all *interesting*.

With a little luck, I could own a C650 sometime in the near future, and
so I was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:

1.  What speed SIMMS does the C650 need/want?  (I know that it needs 80ns
VRAM...not sure for the main RAM.)

2.  I've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
C650's RAM...132 and 136 megs.  Which is true?  (Perhaps another phrasing
would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg SIMM?)

Just wondering....

NNTP-Posting-Host: sfi.santafe.ede
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]


Several weeks ago, I described a problem with my Apple High-Resolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. To
recapitulate: Occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor
momentarily loses sync. The entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. This usually happens right
after I close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen. Sometimes, though, it happens
with no provocation whatsoever.

I have received a bewildering range of replies. At one extreme was
a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the
problem was that the 13"" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
power supply. There was no fix available, he said, because nothing was
really wrong. (I guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured.)

This seemed quite persuasive and I would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13"" monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
Apple Service Technical Procedures, Volume 3, under the heading
Jitter Correction. The section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,
the swap of a circuit board.

I would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
experience with this sort of thing.

8 MB SIMMs do not have to be composite SIMMs, although many (most?) 16 MB 
SIMMs are.  72-pin SIMMs allow two memory banks per SIMM, thus permitting 
the use of 4 Mb DRAM devices (the same ones used on 4 MB SIMMs) to be used 
for two 4 MB banks on one SIMM.  I can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
to build an 8 MB SIMM using 1 Mb DRAMs as the 4 Mb parts reached (and 
exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 Mb parts some time ago.  
It's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 MB SIMM using 4 Mb parts - 
this could cause problems in a Q800.  I'm not sure why you'd want to do 
this, though, as a dual-bank 8 MB SIMM would be cheaper to build than a 
single-bank composite one.

PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but 
asks too much for it (retail $450). I'd buy an external and save about 
$350. 

there is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HD's for the portable, 
they're listed in some of the catalog ""magazines"" for apple stuff you can 
find at bookstores. If I see it again I'll post it. But, again, you might 
want to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the 
powerbooks. You'd be able to use it with a new computer some day. Any 
other mac portable questions, I'll have to cry uncle.

Don't blame me. I voted for XXXXXXX.

The CD300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  
now.  Demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare.  I've seen them  
listed for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus Mac  
reseller.  I've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of CD's,  
but I can't confirm it.

According to the (seen several times) postings from Dale Adams of Apple
Computer, both the 610 and the 650 require 80ns SIMMS - NOT 60 ns.  Only
the Centris 800 requires 60 ns SIMMs.

I'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
in my IIci and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13"" monitor. What's
the deal on them?

1) Do they come with varying amounts of RAM? If so, what is the max
and min? How much do I need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?

2) What bit depths are supported? One, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?

3) Are all these cards accelerated or just some? Is it true that
modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? What
bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? I've heard that some
applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
to the screen (or something like that). Is this a frequent problem?
How much slower is it?

4) Didn't I read (when System 7 first came out) that the card was
incompatible? If so, how was this corrected (Finder patch, some INIT,
or other)? Has it been kept compatible with 7.1? Are there many other
apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
Microsloth) apps, for example)?

5) If you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.

Thanks a lot for you input.

it has an Intel processor on it (#A82380-16 Intel '86)

On an EEPROM there is a sticker with the P/N 700584-01.

right or at least justified, but I'm just a crabby consumer and
when I order a ""Duo210 with modem"" that's the product I expect.

Oh, well.  It's not like it's limited to the computer biz.  Remember

I've had my C610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever.
It's been ""customized"" with---

 * replaced the Apple-Quantum 80 drive with a Connor 212 drive.  

 * installed a Tandberg SCSI tape drive in the internal bay which works
   just fine (though Apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel
   bezels w/ a standard 5.25"" cutout...).  

It's hooked up to an Apple LaserWriter Plus and has no printing
problems at all, tested printing complex Photoshop graphics.

It has expanded VRAM and extra 8 meg SIMM, no problems.

So in sum, I have no idea what this dealer is complaining about.

I too had a very unpleasant experience with ""Hardware That's Shi*"". It
featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who
was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties I
had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their
house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of
junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of
electronics.

I shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me
something over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes
and duties and lost time.

Don't deal with them.

Is that the low-end configuration?  If it is, it has the 68LC040 (no FPU), as  
opposed to all the other configurations with a 68RC040 (has an FPU).  Be sure  
you know what you are getting before you buy!!!  The 68RC040 is around  
$350-$400 right now, if you intend to upgrade it from a 68LC040.

I'm in the market for a laser printer. Used printers are fine, non-apple
printers are fine, but whatever printer I get must fit the following:

Required features:

- PostScript

- 300 dpi

- emough memory to download fonts

- The cheaper, the better.  I'd prefer under $1000.


Nice things:

- anything over 4 pages per minute

- scsi output for a font disk

- smallish footprint



Don't Care About:

- PostScript Level II

- networking (its just for me, and always will be)

- color


I know about Freedom of Press, but I've also heard that its painfully slow.
I can tolerate about 4 ppm, but anything slower than that and I'm not going
to consider the price savings worth it.  I'd be curious to hear people's
experience with it, tho. 

I also infinitely prefer laser over ink; I used to use HP deskjets in
my last job and wasn't impressed with the quality.  I'm a laser bigot
and the first to admit it. :)


I'll be using the printer to layout pages of a book I'm writing.  The
page will include multiple fonts, PS graphics, scanned line art and
maybe greyscale pictures (not sure yet).  The quality doesn't need to
be spectacular, but it needs to be clear and readable.


Printers I've been looking at:


- used LaserWriters: The plus, the NT, the NTR.  Its my understanding that
  only the NTR has a SCSI out for a disk. True?

- Personal LaserWriter (LS and NTR).  I have access to the Apple Employee
  discount (I work for one of Apple's spinoffs), so I can get these reasonably
  cheaply.  I've heard bad things about the LS; comments?  I'm leaning
  towards the Personal NTR, cause it has a nice small footprint.

- LaserWriter Select 300.  I hear it doesn't have PostScript, but I haven't
  seen anything for sure.  I heard mumbles once about a ""postscript upgrade.""
  ??

- Used HP LaserJets.  I've worked with the II and IIP on another platform, and
  they were *painfully* slow.  Are they that bad on the mac?

- I've seen ads for an Epson PS laserprinter that is running quite cheap.
  Any comments on this printer?  I hate the styling (too many ouput trays),
  but if its a decent printer I'll consider it.


Thanks for any comments...

I'm having exactly the same problem.  Again, it's fine when I switch to 16
colors or a smaller monitor.  My configuration is:

Model: Centris 610 with 4 MB/80 HD, 512 VRAM, no cards
Monitor: MAG MX15F with 16"" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)

I just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
new MAG monitor.  It seems to appear either when scrolling through a
window or when using Alpha or Word and I enter <return>.

My guess is bad VRAMs as well.  I really hope it isn't a design flaw.  Is
anyone at Apple listening?

Put me down for a PB100 4/20 with ext. floppy, AppleTalk Remote Acces,
AC adapter, and fresh out of box (was used, but buyer switched to 140
on arrival and sold unopened box. Purchased last October for $925.
Later I bought a used PowerPort V.32 9600 bps internal fax-modem for
something like $225, I'm using right now! Works great!  :)

No real complaints. I love my portable system (got a color home setup
also. Mac II). Reasoning was that MATLAB programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or
overnight) to run, tying up my Mac II. I got the PB100 with fast modem
to do light work and on-the-run stuff. I figured I'd give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college. It's running System
7.1 now without any problems. Also I sometimes do DEC4015 terminal
emulations with MATLAB on our university's VAX_VMS (nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac IIfx).
So, the PB100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not
too hard at all for it). It was a FABULOUS setup !!!!  :)  Weeee!!!

(By the Way, all MATLAB software was on class accounts. I was also the
TA for a class that used SIMULAB/SIMULINK. We had site-license and
take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... No pirating
there, incase you're wondering.... Great Program!!! )

Just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never
get enuff memory.... Buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you
get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... I ALWAYS
run out of disk space... But I have a syquest on the Mac IIsi, so I
never worried about space before... Got several carts).

I just recently purchased the GCC BLP Elite and I really like it.  My
needs
are much the same as what you describe.  In addition, I wanted to get one
that
I could access via AppleTalk, so that eliminated the new line of
inexpensive 
printers from Apple.  The print quality is good to excellent based on
what 
font you're using and what paper you use.  I'm still experimenting with 
different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
fine.

Printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed
jobs is
very easy.  There is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of
the
sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet
from
the sheet feeder, as some do).

(I have no affiliation with GCC, just a satisfied customer.)

setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and
wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.


If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,
or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is
possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 
'sad mac' sound.


This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.
If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel
there is something incorrect with the logic board. 

My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.

Subject: Formatting more than 1440K - Possible???
Organization: Cal State Long Beach
Lines: 18

A friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can
format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a HD disk. Apparently it
rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get
more space out of a normal HD floppy disk.  It supposedly gets upto 1.6 Megs
(so something like 1640K?). I don't have the program - since I can't use it
and its supposed to be called something like ""FORM16"" or something like that.

My question is whether its possible to do this on the Mac and if its not
possible is it due to hardware limitations. A developer friend of mine said
that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field
much.

Thanks for any information contributed.

My Centris 610 is working perfectly.  There is one problem that I have

is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
works with my machine.  I assume it is some sort of software problem and

I agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the GC
with a Quadra. I have seen an alpha version of an extension from Apple called
8.24 GC QuickTime Video which offloads QuickTime compression/decompression
from the cpu to the AM29000 on the card. So it seems it can be done even though
in a developer article it states that the GC can't be programmed - but they
asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...

Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser.
I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments

machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU  
(namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I  
primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  
analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of  
numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice

There are two approaches:

1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
for some special thing at a Mac store.

It already happened as far as I know... I got some email about three

Hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
 
If you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
 
I'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so I have
two monitors and cards for sale. Nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
I'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
screen.
 
I'd prefer to sell to people near Austin and surrounding areas (within
driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but I CAN ship to you if you
don't live near here. Only problem is that I didn't keep the original boxes
for the monitors, but I'm confident that my few months of full-time service
in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
flip it in your direction.
 
Details:
 
Mirror Full Page Display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
---------------------------------------------------
 
**SOLD**
 
Sony 1304 14"" color monitor:
----------------------------
What's to say? It got top ratings in last year's MacUser report. It's a SONY,
Trinitron, arguably the best (but I'd rather not argue that point).
It's a great monitor, in great shape, but I'm going to a bigger screen,
and although I'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
 
Still selling for $599 at MacLand (where I bought it originally - not
including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). Again, make an
offer if that sounds unreasonable.
 
 
RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):
------------------------------------------------------------------
Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13""
monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode
(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and output
NTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or a
RAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 meg
SIMMS).
 
Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking
**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box and
packaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this card
together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a ""bundled offer""
for these items.
 
------------
 
Cheers.

I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!
I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its price
was better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when I
tried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was a
resale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standard
number (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man could
not do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDA
over the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEAT
EMPTOR.

However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist
- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probably
get a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail order
out of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remains
to be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe out
an educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DO
include sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!

I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,
but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,
the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing this
from memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it's
hard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,
if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,
the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensing
problem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompress
a board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.

Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holes
in Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.
Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product since
they're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)

The Quadralink by AE is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.
I've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal
bug has crept into their more recent s/w. The bug only shows up during
heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (MacsBug can not
reboot, time to hit the restart button).

AE told me in January that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
which I described to them. Since then they have not answered any of my
faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.

The QL has been great, but for now I have mine sidelined. If you are only
going to be using 2400 Baud or less, then you may have no, or very
infrequent problems,

I am resending this message because my news program may have goofed the first

Terry, I recently bought an LCIII and a Datadesk 101E. I don't
remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
a strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disable
all extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, using
the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checked
the dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tell
me if it works.
             
I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail for
inspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said they
have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had the          
keyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little info
from them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
the keyboard and their technical support line is not toll free. tell me
if you have a similar experience with them.

	For what it's worth, my experience has been that the educational
discount (which my S.O. has taken advantage of, as a teacher) is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that I'm able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multi-state corporation, which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the ""discount"" computer chains (e.g. CompUSA).
	For purposes of budget estimation around here, we usually just knock
around 20% off SRP.

X-XXDate: Thu, 15 Apr 93 16:05:44 GMT

We have recently obtained a Centris 610 and it has developed an unusual
video problem. 

Model:	610 with 8 MB/230 HD, 512K VRAM, no cards
Monitor:	Apple 16""

When the computer is set for 256 colors and certain operations are done,
particularly vertical scrolling through a window, horizontal white lines
appear on the monitor (which generally but not always spare open
windows).  These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If a
window is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved away
the line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is not
observed if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Apple
monitor with 256 colors is used. 

I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem has
been apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.

We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, how
to fix it.  Please also respond to azelenet@bigmac.mskcc.org.  Thank you
for your help.

Just thought I would mention that Sony no longer manufactures the CPD-

1430, which just like Apple's new Sony Trinitrom CLAIMS to be 14 inches.
I'm not sure of the details on the defects, but I work at our schools

How do you calculate that figure? I'd assume even in personal computers

Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like to
ask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create a
marketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important at
this point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a ""full page"" monitor
for laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installed
by authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBook
screen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that you
would get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,
technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screen
and the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR ""full"" height. 
The screen would probably be monochrome.
The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be very
popular among business people.  Business people also commonly use word
processing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenient
to see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users and
applications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We could
hopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.

Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I really
need some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to me
via email and let me know:
1. If you would consider buying a ""full page"" laptop screen
2. How much you would be willing to pay for it
3. Any helpful commentaries on the idea

Also, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,
but who knows!), please send me some.

Thanks in advance!!!

	I wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.  This is pretty standard in portable machines, and the
same kinds of tricks could be played; spinning down disks, turning off
screens, reducing clock speed, etc.  The advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be 1) you don't have to remember to do anything and 2)
the machine is still available over the network.

	The tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.
Certainly, you don't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you, but you do want to wake up (at least the CPU) if somebody
logs in via a telnet connection.

	I wouldn't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter
months; that energy is just getting turned into heat.  It may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant, but it's
not too bad.  In the summer though, it's a disaster.  Not only are you
wasting that power, but you're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat.

Hello all!

For few past days I've been fighting to get My NEC Multisync 3D
(predecessor of 3FG) to work properly with the internal video of Mac
IIvi.

With a VGA-adapter (as described in Dale Adams' posting about Quadra
video) it works, only some minor interferences occur, small enough not
to prevent any action on screen to be visible & clear.

But because the scanrates & stuff of 3D are well enough for emulating
Apple 13"" RGB, I first made an adapter, then got one fron the local
distributor of NEC.
With both adapters I can get a picure, which looks excellent most of
the time or every now and then.
But with radical changes on screen (opening palettes, large windows
etc.) there are major interferences in sync. The picture either tilts
sideways or scrables up totally. Even when it is clear, there are some
""spiky"" interferences on horizontal line alignment when accessing
pull-downs etc.
With the self-made adapter, almost identical to the VGA one, only
sense pins differ, it is sometimes impossible to even boot up with a
picture clear enough to shut down from menu...
With the adapter from NEC, everything is well most of the time, but
sometimes the picture tilts badly sideways or the sync is completely
lost. But not nearly as often as with the self-made one.

I know, with self made adapters there can always be interference, but
with the one provided by NEC... where's the source of this interference?

I'll give you the pinouts of the whole mess, and I hope that you can,
at least someone (please try =) figure out what could be the best pin
assignment for NEC 3D.
I am going to make a completely new cable with maximum shieldings and
isolations, as soon as someone figures out how the pins should be
arranged, especially syncs and groundings.

Yes, I have checked that the monitor is not defective, it works
perfectly well with all PC graphic adapters up to 1024x768 pixels and
also Atari 71Hz monochrome, which I am using now with it.

Here are the pinouts & stuff:

15 pin mini D-sub (NEC 3D)		15 pin D-sub (Mac, at least Quadra)

1  Red Video				1  Red GND
2  Green Video				2  Red Video
3  Blue Video				3  Composite Sync
4  GND					4  Sense 0
5  GND					5  Green Video
6  Red GND				6  Green GND
7  Green GND				7  Sense 1

14 V.Sync				14 H.Sync GND
15 NC					15 H.Sync

I also use Retrospect, but I noticed that Central Point Software's
""MacTools Backup"" also supports the Apple tape drive under 7.x. 
The Apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of Retrospect
relative to the simpler MacTools Backup are less significant than 
might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a DAT drive.  

Used Apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for Retrospect when MacTools 
is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.

Retrospect is nice, though, and I'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.

Well, I don't exaclty know what _should_ be done, but what I do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use.  I do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though.  Turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less RAM than
a screen saver (but it requires more of MY memory to remember to turn
it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though :-)

Apple has patented their implementation of regions, which presumably
includes the internal data structure (which has never been officially
documented by Apple).  Apple cannot patent the concept of a region.

I'm guessing that either NuTek reverse-engineered Apple's internal data
structure for regions (I dunno if this would hold up in court), or they
came up with their own data structure.  If it's the latter, then they
won't be able to draw PICT files containing regions.  Besides PICT files,
there aren't many places where regions are stored on disk.  (QuickTime
movies, perhaps?)  As long as the region isn't being stored on disk and
transferred from a Mac to a NuTek clone (or vice versa), it doesn't
matter if NuTek uses a completely different internal data structure.

I remember reading that Apple also has a patent on their ADB hardware,
and that the NuTek clones would therefore be lacking an ADB port.  What
other patents does Apple have on the Mac?

I am using a NEC 4FG with my Centris 610. The cable adapter was provided by
NEC (you have to call to get this free adapter). I am also sharing it with my
486 (using a switch box and extra cables).

My questions: 

	How do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?
	Or how do you change the mode(resolution)? 
	Is there SW for this or something I have to do with the HW?

I am assuming I am getting 800x600 since I have 1M VRAM and the 4FG can display
1028x768(?) with my 486.

Wrong, the CD300 (external) is just a plain ol' SCSI device.

No, multisession capability and double speed are two different thing.  Its just  
that the newer CD ROM drives have both capability.  Multisession means that  
when you put more pictures on a photo CD after the first session, the drive can  
read and display them.  Double speeds just transfer ANY type of data (excluding  
sound) at around double the speed.

CD150 is not multisession capable.  This means that you lose the ability to add  
any more pictures after the first time (must buy a new CD).  Finally, since the  
CD150 is not a double speed drive, it will require twice as long to transfer  
data (excluding sound).

I've had the same experience actually. I love the Mac interface and any number
of the features, but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. I use macs daily
and am a Moc consultant for OSU Statistics department; I'm familiar with almost
every model out there, and my experience is that both the Amiga and the Atari
ST simply ""blow the Mac out of the water"" in terms of performance. At this time
I would in general say that the other advantages of the Mac outweigh the
advantages of the Amiga or the ST (and Falcon), but I really wish Apple would
get their heads together on speed... :-((((( They could take a real lesson in
muli-tasking from the Amiga OS or the MultiTOS in the Atari Falcons too :-(((

I just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does *everything* well
someday. If I had my choice, I would go with Mac in most aspects, but add the
speed and superior Multi-Tasking of the other platforms.

As for the original topic; Trying to compare *just the chip* in a machine seems
almost worthless. A fast 386 with a wiz-bang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock Quadra. Add a
graphics accelerator to a 486 and you *really fly*. Of course, add one the the
Quadra and then you're blowing the 486 away... etc...

By rotating the plate around the mouse ball counter-clockwise you can open

have you tried printing the data file (TIFF) from another application such

I have some questions about this subject.  I like to leave my
computer on if I think I'm going to be using it withing the next 2 or
3 hours, but I get sick of my Dad constantly coming up to me and
asking ""Why is the computer on if you're not using it?""  I also
wonder about my computer being harmed by fluctuations in voltage from
other things (garbage disposal, etc.)  Here are my questions:
 
How much harm do voltage fluctuations cause?  My computer does not
share a circuit with anything big but our my light dims when a
refrigerator comes on or the garbage disposal is turned on (whose
doesn't?), and also when the washing machine does anything.  All
these things cause a drop in voltage which is harmful to a computer,
right?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different
speeds.  Is it safer to turn it off and back on when I want to use it
or to leave it on?
 
How much electricity does my computer use?  I have an Apple IIgs (ne
flames), with a Kensington System saver GS (1 electric fan inside),
an AppleColor RGB monitor, and an EXTERNAL 3.5"" HD (1 fan and its own
P/S).  How do I translate this into Kilowatt-Hours?  Also, how much
of this is used by the monitor?
 
Does the monitor use considerably less juice when the screen is
totally black but still on?
 
Many computers spin the HD up and down constantly to save power.  I
always thought this was harmful to the HD and defeats the purpose of
leaving the computer on in the first place (except portables).  Is
this true?
 
Thanks for the Info.  I think this will help lots of people.

    Mostly. The Q950 does have a SCSI2 controller chip as it's SCSI
chip, but it does not have the chips to use the Wide or Fast SCSI-2
modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of SCSI
performance over the Q900. It does, howrever, have a faster I/O

Subject: Cache Card and Optimum Memory Settings?
Organization: fnal

NNTP-Posting-Host: phurh.fnal.gov

Here's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don't
rob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.

Hi.

He needs insert the MO before FileSharing get turned on, and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine. (I'm not sure but seems
that the check ""Allow owner to see entire disk"" should be enabled too).

A bad thing: you can't eject the disk until FS is turned off.

Hope that helps.

  I had a similar problem with my StyleWriter I (the original!).
Have you tried cleaning the print heads? With the SWII driver, it's
and option in the Print dialog box. Sometimes I had to do it several
times to get the crud out. Yes it wastes ink, but it beats those
white annoying lines.
  Another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
black box. It can help to get the ink flowing.
  Good luck!

Their should be no difference in the drive itself between IBM-PC and Mac.
The two main differences are the formatting of the disk itself (but with
the correct software each can read the others) and maybe the cable
(depends on your SCSI board on IBM-PC).

If you get some Mac softawre to allow mounting of ANY IBM-formatted disk
and the correct cable you should br able to mount and read your IBM-PC
syquest.

Close, but no cigar.  The LISA was introduced in January, 1983 (at the

The audio will simply select the CD audio when the microphone is removed. 
I don't believe the button un-dims, since there's nothing to select.  I

Organization: The MacInteresteds of Nashville, Tn.
Lines: 37

Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the 
Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:
(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes
(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 
running at 15.87 Mhz.
(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a 
lot of memory.
(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors 
that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors 
sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell 
memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most 
memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether 
the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine 
California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - 
$140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that 
are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.
(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an 
average access time of about 25 ms.
(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a 
backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move 
your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or 
non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.

Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay 
for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to 
sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about 
$650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for 
about $900. 

The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.

I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got 
one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright

The magnet trick will work. Be careful when you apply the white tape to the
rubber carriage roller, it tells the scanner where the edge is and it can come

Subject: Disappearing hard drive in LC?
Organization: CONCERT-CONNECT -- Public Access UNIX
Lines: 31

The internal HD in my LC disappeared for a day last week, and I'd like to
hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.

It is an LC, with 10MB of RAM and an 80MB internal drive, running system
7.1, with a few SCSI devices in a (so far as I know) properly terminated
chain.

I had shut down the system for a day-- I was out of town and we sometimes
have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking
question mark.  I booted from a floppy and saw that my external HD seemed
okay, but there was no sign of the internal.

I installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot
from it.  I tried things like Disk First Aid and Silverlining, to inquire
about the internal drive.  They either could not find it or got errors in
trying to talk to it. (Silverlining claimed it was a Connor drive, but it
is a Quantum... )

Well, I'd backed things up, so I was able to work.  But, at some point I
noticed that the internal had reappeared.  Now, Disk First Aid says that
all's well, etc.  Things seem to be fine.

But, what happened?  Was this a warning that something (the internal HD
or something else) is about to die?  I'm definitely nervous.

And, if this is a signal that the internal HD is sick, is it true that I
can only put up to a 127MB drive inside an LC?  Some folks have claimed
there's a limitation in the LC (other'n size or power) while others (and
that includes LaCie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.

Thanks for answers.

I can produce similar artifacts.

I am using a Centris 610 with an Apple 16"" monitor.  I got the 8/230/CD
configuration, so there is on-board ethernet and 1 Megabyte of video ram.
The effect only occurs in 256 color and 256 grey modes.  Any vertical scrolling operation, whether with a scrollbar or, say, using vi and inserting lines,
will produce a scattering of horizontal flickering lines on the screen.
They do not persist -- each is visible for perhaps one refresh, and then
that part of the screen is back as usual.

They seem to always start at or about the 64th pixel from the left,
and are maybe 512 pixels wide.  This is certainly not preventing me from
using my Macintosh ;-), but it does seem to be a sign of something
perhaps grounded incorrectly in the video circuitry...


I went ahead and called the Apple Customer Assistance Center, at:
  1-800-776-2333, or 1-800-767-2775 (more direct?)

The person who answered was polite :-).  I also took the chance to complain
about my mouse button sticking, and about the mac hanging on boot after a
(hard - killed MacsBug) crash which left a CD in the drive.  (I had to play
with a paperclip for about 5 minutes to get thing to eject, after which the
mac booted fine.)

I vote for turning them off at night.  THe stress of off/on is a little 
harmful, so don't turn it off, then back on an hour later, etc, but
turning them off for 4-5 hours or overnight is a good idea.

The electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight, along
with heat.

who cares? (they are off 24 hours a day).

   I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there.  So it would
seem that the 140 and 170 are out though.  One way to tell is to
go and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a setting
there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If it
is present when you open the control panel, then you can assume that
SetWUTime will work.

	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  The
processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
computer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed is
pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
to increase speed among other things.

	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when 
you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.
Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?

	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
is good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor is
based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
processor to speed it up.  

	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
processor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will work
well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
somewhere with our discussions.

But the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
you can get - an Alpha is WAY slow at 66 MHz, but blazes at
200 MHz.

>>680040
>>486

>As far as the 486DX2-66 goes - 32 SPECint92, 16 SPECfp92 .

But the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 MHz version,
making it ""comparable"" to a 486DX2-80

I think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
cycles but less power behind each cycle. Not to mention that the
Intel instruction stream is BYTE-oriented (longest Intel instruction
is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
intelligent memory subsystem.

Yes, the IIci has 32-bit clean ROMs.
 
Either model would be a good choice.  Another option: get a ""new"" IIci

There's only one physical size for VRAM SIMMs (unlike DRAM SIMMs which 
come in many, many sizes and pinouts), although they do come with 
differing amounts of VRAM on them.  The ones you need are 256KB SIMMs, are 
organized as 128K x 16, and have two 128K x 8 VRAM chips on them.  This is 
the only size which the Quadra and Centris machines can use.

Two.

Both SIMM slots must be filled; putting a SIMM in only one slot does 
nothing for you.

80 ns for the Q800 and C650, 100 ns for the C610.

There are certain VRAM chip manufacturers whose parts are not compatible 
with the Quadra and Centris video hardware.  Make sure that the source you 
get them from guarantees compatiblity.  In general, if it works in a Q950,
it will work in a Q800.

I have replaced the osz to 66 MHz yesterday and no truble at all. My Quadra now works at 33 MHz stable for more than 14 hours. I have also tried a 70 MHz osz, but after 1/2 hour my Quadra 700 died. I am not sure what was the reason for that,
but it is to risky to run it to fast. Most of your Quadras 700 should work at 33 MHz without any problems. 

But a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. During my 35 MHz test I damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. So once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!

Now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.

Very interesting are the graphics results (Graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. Two points which my cause problems are the 4 MByte Ram solder on the board. The are only 80ns Rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 MHz. The next part which may cause trouble are the Video Rams. I have the orignal 100ns VRAMs from Apple in my Quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. Most of the other parts on the Quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.

The most importaned question is do I neat a new heat sink. I would say NO. After running my Quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. A 33 MHz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the Quadra, so I didn't see any problems. The room temperatur was 22 Celsius (72 F). If you living in a area were it is hot 100 F (45 C) and your room temperatur is not mutch below I would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.


Hope you will have the same success than I had,

Has anybody tried running these higher resolutions??

Somewhere I thought I read that the 1152x870 on a 17"" monitor may make the

Hello. I have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the
powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). Is there a
difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
any other mac, say plus or ii?? I have heard, though not confirmed
by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.

I also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
allowing speeds just as any other serial port.

My particular use is that I have a 6811 EVB board that I need to
interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. 
Currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  I set everything
up just as in lab and nothing.  In fact, the powerbook locks up.

Can anyone help, inform, advise? I would appreciate it.  
I would prefer email since I don't read the news at all.
I will post a summary if enough response is generated.

Thanks.

 This is a pet peeve of mine. I wish companies would put power switches on the
 front of the equipment! If my Apple monitor had the switch on the front, I
 would happily power it off at night. Almost every piece of computer equipment
 I own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and
 modems--why?). I hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.

	We bought one from Relax technologies.  BIG mistake.  The drive

new compression model), and worst of all, when I opened the drive up to

in the case they forgot to clean it before putting the drive in.  This was
a HP drive, by the way, and is now working fine (knock on wood), no thanks
to Relax technologies.

Hey, your mileage may vary, but let me suggest that you NOT buy from Relax
Technologies, even though their prices are usually about the lowest.

of course it was in Dale's post, just not in the words that MacUser 
used.  ROM accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
has been rewritten (inside the ROM) to take advantage of the 68040
addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.

Second Wave makes NuBus card cages that work on the PDS slots of at
least three Macs: the SE/30, IIsi and Centris 610. They have not, to
my knowledge, announced such a device for the LCII, but they could
make one, technologically.

The PDS card that goes to the cage simply needs the NuBus controller
circuitry present on NuBus Macs.

Why, though, does anyone care about this? dgr has a three-PDS
adapter for the LC/LCII. They will soon have one for the LCIII. PDS
is better than NuBus for most people in most applications. Granted,
there are more NuBus cards. But, most applications that require a
NuBus card (like full-motion video capture) shouldn't be done on an
LC/LCII/LCIII anyway.

Intel chips have traditionally been faster than their Motorola ""equivalents""
although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
is something that is highly debatable.

For a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
bright overhead projector designed to be used with an LCD panel (i.e.
stage must not get too hot). I tried out a Proxima Ovation unit and liked
it, but I needed a brighter projector (I used it with a 3M 920). It is
also too expensive for what you get, IMHO. Prices of active matrix panels
are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
with tarrifs being lifted I think). 

In Canadian dollars, the Proxima Ovation models ranged in price from about
$5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. For
that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
projector, but sacrifice portability.

Oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you
want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
light wash out your display at the front of the room. Tricky to get right.

Reply-To: petrack@vnet.IBM.COM
Disclaimer: This posting may contain no views at all
News-Software: Usenet 3.1
Lines: 45

I have tried almost everything under the sun to get a null modem connection
between a Mac Duo 210 and a PC. I have used MacKermit and VersaTerm on
the Mac side. I have used Procomm, Kermit, and Softerm (on OS/2) on
the PC (or PS) side. I have used non-Hardware handshaking and hardware
ahdshaking cables. And know MY hands are shaking from the effort. Nothing
has allowed file transfers from the Mac to the PS.

In general, I can type back and forth with no trouble, but only if both sides
are set to speeds OVER 9600 baud. I cannot send files from the Mac to the
PS at all, and file transfers from the Duo to the PS are not possible.
When I do a straight ascii send, I can send from the PS to the Duo flawlessly.
I can send Binhex files this way quite fast, and I know that the
transmission is error free.
But straight ascii sent from the Mac to the PS is full of errors.
Unless, of course, I do text pacing so slow that it is like human
typing. (well, like 2-3 times faster than human typing).

I would like to hear from ANYONE who has been able to transfer files
from a Duo 210 to a PS via modem or null modem. If you can do it, please
tell me your EXACT combination of hardware and software. Obviously, I am
talking of a true serial port modem, not the express modem. Maybe some
kind soul with access to a modem and a Duo 210 can check this out for me.

Right now, I am of the opinion that it won't work at high speeds because
of the power interrupts on the Duo, and it won't work at low speeds
because of some crazy reason I don't understand.

Could I hear from someone attesting that they can really pump information
out the serial port of a Duo 210 fast? Like via a modem or via a
sys-ex dump?

Could anyone with a Duo help me out?? I am going absolutely INSANE.
I wanna know if the problem is MY Duo, or all Duo 210s, or all Duos,
or just me.

Yes, I have checked the cable 1,000,000 times. And not only can I type
back and forth, but Zterm alerts the users if s/he uses hardware handshaking
and CTS is down. So I know that hardware handshaking is working. And also,
According to Zterm port stats, the buffer never overflows.

Please help me figure out what's going on...

You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to
handle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost
computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video
board.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop
one later.

This is also false. What you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and
electronics, not the drive speed. I'll admit, though, that I have
not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.

The above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.

The Apple CD300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session PhotoCD
capable drive. So are drives based on the slightly-faster Toshiba
XM3401. Some companies selling such drives are: Spin Peripherals (a
bargain at $499) and PLI (a company I hate) and Relax Technologies
(a company I know little about other than that they are  a longtime
player in Mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). The NEC
CDR74 is also a good choice (NEC's own mechanism, I think). ClubMac
sells it for around $619.

>Thanx.

Your welcome, ooh but now I see your from Germany. Most of the
mailorder info does you little good, I guess. If not:
Spin Peripherals -- 800-466-1200
Club Mac         -- 800-258-2622
Relax Tech       -- 510-471-6112

Nothing wrong with the Apple, though, which is based on a Sony
mechanism and speed-identical to the NEC. The Toshiba's speed
advantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)
and 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).

Good luck,

The supplemental manual that comes with the Quadra 800 explains it. I
don't have the manual in front of me, but as I recall, you insert the CD
while the machine is running, select Restart from the special menu, and
then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the CD

Command-Option-Delete or Command-Ctrl-Del.

The kit is for an already existing Laserwriter IINTX. It is a ROM
upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
efficient, speedier code that first became available in Adobe Type

That software came out after the original NTXes and the so-called

It would also be great for another reason - when not docked, it could serve
as an ARA server to the large internal HD, your corporate email, etc.  In
a pinch, you would also have two machines, instead of 1.5.

If they could couple that thought with RocketShare, and let you use both the
'030 on the PB and the '040 on the dock, it would be a mighty powerful dock.

The Toshiba has a 200ms access time, the NEC has a 280ms access
time, right around the Sony/Apple. Access time is, of course,
somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of CDs as data
transfer rate.

All the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer
rates of 300K/second. Any is a good choice. Apple's is very cheap
when included with new Macs and I agree with Christian's comment
about drivers.

Plus, Apple's is bootable on the Centris and Quadra 800. A very nice
feature if you need to install System software. I don't know if the
NEC or Toshiba are bootable on those machines.

	Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! Sorry -- wrong. It would be an
extremely hot idea...at least with the current Alphas. The available
Alphas run up to 200 MHz. But they produce quite a bit of heat. In
fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
sinks.
	Also Apple looks pretty commited to the PowerPC route instead
of a deal with DEC.

Hmmm... Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  
trying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  
and my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  
to make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  
place to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  
that the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  
wrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  
could be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   
It could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  
wrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  
correct actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  
my NeXT that way.

Now I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  
problem, and at pretty high speeds too.

I don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  
pretty standard.

Hope this helps,

    To display Millions of colors on a 16"" monitor you need 2MB of VRAM
in the Q950.

    Correct. This is the amount of on-board VRAM that the Q800 comes
with.

>Is it possible, and if yes, how many VRAM SIMMs should I take from the 950?

    Yes this is possible. Technically, you only need to take out 2 of
the VRAM SIMMs but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5MB of VRAM. It only
knows 1MB and 2MB.

>From the documentation I have, the Quadra 800 must get 1 Mo VRAM to have
>16-bit color, is that correct?

    Yes, this is correct. You get to 1MB by putting 2 256k VRAM SIMMs
into the VRAM SIMM slots on the Q800's motherboard.

>Bonus question: where do VRAM SIMMs hide? From the 950 documentation, they

    Yup. You have to take off the power supply. It's only a couple of
screws so you should be ok. Just make sure that everything is
disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges.

I can't say for sure with the IIvx -> C650 upgrade, but I wondered the
same thing when I ordered my LC -> LC III upgrade.  Turns out the ""upgrade""
is actually an entire CPU minus any disk drives.  You pull the floppy and
hard drives out of the old one, stick them in the new one, and you've got
an LC III.

The IIvx -> C650 may be the same thing.

It might be something to look into for those people who are unhappy that
Apple only sells Macs pre-packaged with the drives.  Of course, the price
is quite a bit higher without the trade-in...

Here is the story:
I have a network with 4 Macs on Localtalk. One of them has an
Ethernet Card, and is currently connected to a NeXT (don't laugh
I got it for the price of a Mac IIsi). The NeXT is connected
to the internet over SLIP running on a 9600 baud modem.

Currently, we can telnet from the Mac w/ Ethernet to the NeXT,
and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.

What we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
will route telnet sessions from the Localtalk Macs to the NeXT
via the Ethernet Mac. From what we have heard, AIR doesn't do
the trick.

Software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
there aren't going to be any.

Our immediate interest is to be able to get to the NeXT and telnet
out again. The SLIP connection doesn't allow us to assign IP numbers
to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...

thanks in advance.

Just use a thin film of epoxy.  That!s what I did.  Epoxy conducts heat
fairly well.  And my heat sink gets warm to prove it.  I looked for the
stuff myself & my local EE jocks said to use epoxy.

Have fun.

I have a few questions that I would like answers to 
(or opinions on) since I'm thinking about buying a LC-III:

Q1) When the PowerPC-based Macs are announced, what will
happen to the 680X0-based Macs?  

Q2) Is System 7 the 'last word' for 680X0-based Macs? 
Will we ever get REAL multi-tasking for the Mac?

Q3) Will there be a way for NuBUS/PDS-equipped Macs to add 
a PowerPC-on-a-board to their systems?

I'd hate to think that I'm going to put my $$ down
on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a
dead-end product line!

Dynamic RAM is not based on flip-flops; there's basically a single
transistor and capacitor to store each bit!  Static RAM is based on
flip-flops, and is much more expensive and much less dense.  And
neither has any parts that ""move"", if electrons and thermal expansion
are ignored...

    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think
we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is
no ""option"" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:
there is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full
'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).
And there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
than the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one
of the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be
getting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't
be able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.
It's not an ""option.""
    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s
thinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot
recognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
a FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or
something like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to
replace the LC040 with a full '040. And if you have a C610, you will not
need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the
full '040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.
