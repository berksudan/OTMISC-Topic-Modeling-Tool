Sorry, that's a feature.  The ICCCM specifies how the app should set its title, so the wm is obliged to do it.  If this bothers you, complain to the app writer.

Write your own wm that doesn't support the ICCCM.  Or write an program that you give a window ID and a title.  The your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it, your program switches it back again.

I know for a fact that the EISA version of the Orchid ProDesigner IIS
works.  However, an EISA SVGA card is likely a waste of money.

When XFree86 2.0 comes out, with support for accelerated chipsets, ISA,
EISA, and VLB will all be supported.

The more important question is ""what chipsets are supported?"".  The bus
is basically irrelevent as a compatibility issue.

If so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not,
how hard do we think it might be to send input to other X applications and,
hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (If an application is

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. They place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

Currently, my solution is:

	XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetWMProperties(..);
	XMapWindow(...);
	XFlush(...);
	XMoveWindow(...);


It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
if I'm overlooking something obvious.

Keywords: sun sun3 X11R5 console
Organization: INMOS Limited, Bristol, UK
Lines: 23

We have an old Sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  When X11R5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  After X is fully
started we run an xterm as the ""console"" - the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  ""Refresh window"" fails
to remove them.  The messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them.

At boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
We're running X in color, and I suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the B/W framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.

My question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid
of these messages?

Please reply by e-mail to hughm@inmos.co.uk.

  Yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in
/usr/lpp/GL somewhere... (it's named Glib.c; my IBM's down right now
though, so I can't find the exact location :)

  WARNING: this code feels quite bogus. It does things like calling
noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an X window id from it
anyway. It worked just fine under aix 3.1; I spent last weekend trying
to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's
turning into a Hard Job.

  Check out your ""info"" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on
whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and X, and how to go about
doing so.

You wanna do masking. Build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name ""opaque"" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. Use this
bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for XCopyArea(), and remember to
adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the XCopyArea() blit origin.

The Mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using RAMDAC analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.

But be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 MIPS...

We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over
a serial line.
I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib
program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose 
event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to 
receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server 
round-trip delays. It's a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.

Is this a valid test to perform ? I've also tried the xbench program, available
from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I 
just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is ""acceptable"" interactive 
response time. Has anyone got any ideas on this subject ?

Bristol Technology announces the availability of 
its HyperHelp(tm) and Xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.

This demo showcases the two products in the form of a 
diagram editor called DE.

Download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself:

	 o Complete on-line context sensitive help system.

	 o Printing support for PCL5 and PostScript.

	 o Rotated Text support!

	 o Source code for the demo is provided.

The demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).

There are two versions of the demo located in the vendor/Bristol directory:
Sun     - sun4.demo.tar.Z (SunOS 4.x)
HP      - hp700.tar.Z     (HP-UX 8 & 9)

If you have any questions about the demo, send an
e-mail to: support@bristol.com.

If you want another version of the demo (rs6000,etc...) 
please send an e-mail to: info@bristol.com.

Remember to use binary mode!


What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
---------------------------------------------------------
Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.

			    HyperHelp 3.0
			    -------------
HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
line function call, application developers can access the
full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,
project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility.
This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and
Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!

New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character
based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History
window.

			     Xprinter 2.0
			     ------------
Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing/new X based applications
very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
our demo and see Xprinter in action.

If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier
this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for UNIX SVR4.2.


Feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
HyperHelp and Xprinter. 

If you have any questions or comments, send them to us at:
info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438-6969.

				Happy demoing,

Read the documentation for the SimpleMenu (4.2.3 Positioning the SimpleMenu).
The reference is to the R5 documentation.

I had not done this before but in less than 10 mins I knocked up the following
Wcl application that does what you want using a Command widget. Even if you are
not familiar with Wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on. The crucial thing is the use of the XawPositionSimpleMenu and
MenuPopup actions.

Subject: Colormap Problem
Organization: F31
Lines: 24

I am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on
another machine (both are HP 9000 Model 750s).  The image is created
using XCreateImage and XGetImage and displayed with XPutImage.  The
image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because
the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.

I tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay,
performed a table lookup against the new colormap.  This didn't work
because some rgb combos don't exist in the new colormap.

Is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values, or
is there a simpler way to solve this problem?  I tried using xinitcolormap
but couldn't get that to work either.

Any help would be appreciated.

I would further add that a 486/50,S3/928,8mb,15"",200mbDISK is going to cost
/WAY/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  Color makes it not apples/apples too.
Xterminals provide better price/performance than PCs.  You can make a PC
much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make PC's perform great, and
cost more.  You pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
of a PC.  For home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.

Subject: How to see characterset from wchar_t
Nntp-Posting-Host: emu
Distribution: comp
Organization: Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan
Lines: 137


We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System.
The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5's i18n
facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MIT's 
X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit
uses Xsi.

Our toolkit manages each character's size based on our own font management system.
In order to do that, the 'wchar_t' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with 
ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment's locale. In this case if the locale is 'japanese',
each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.

We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.

We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used
Xsi's internal functions to construct that function. The following is the
source code of that function 'decomposeCharacterSet()'.


//I18N.h
// This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*-
// $Id: I18N.h,v 1.1 1992/01/21 12:05:24 iima Exp iima $

				 int wc_len,		/* IN */
				 char *buf,		/* OUT */
				 int *buflen,		/* IN/OUT */
				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
				 char **charset);	/* OUT */
extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str);
extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);

#endif /* _I18N_H */

//I18N.cc

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include ""I18N.h""

#include <X11/wchar.h>

    extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int,
					 char*, int*, int*, int*);
    extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);
    extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID);
};

int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */
			  int wc_len,		/* IN */
			  char *buf,		/* OUT */
			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */
			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */
			  char **charset)	/* OUT */
{
    XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();
    int ctid;
    int status;
    Charset *xcharset;
    
    status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf,
				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);
    if (status == Success) {
	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid));
	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;
    }
    else
	*charset = NULL;
    return status;
}
----------------

An included file above, ""Xlocaleint.h"", is also Xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.

A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.

When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit,
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing:
    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)
    _Xmbfscs (code)
    _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)
    _XFallBackConvert (code)

We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until
HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that
because HP did not release HP's X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to 
know how HP's R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsi's popularity and used 
its internal functions. 

The HP's linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented.
We observe from HP's libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used MIT's vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and
therefore, finding just counter part functions in MIT's Ximp for Xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution.

My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposeCharacterset()' listed above. Is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales?
If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we
want to use any internal functions in HP's X11R5 as we did for MIT's R5.

In order to render a 'wchar_t' type string, there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string. We have no way to find out that without any HP's X11R5 source 
files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal. 
Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.

I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area
even if it is not HP's implementation.

Thank you.

Reply-To: buzz@bear.com (Buzz Moschetti)
Organization: Bear, Stearns & Co. - FAST
Lines: 18

(2nd posting of the question that just doesn't seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.

What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,
the specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined
with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:
""Ctrl Any<Key>q"".

This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If
you're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics
changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's
expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as
translations.

>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?

If you mean ""menu accelerator"", no it's not possible.  That's according to
the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.

I can't think of a reason why not.

There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators
resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).

For example,

  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade
					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton
							  - exitPushbutton

  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O
  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O
  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q
  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q

  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\
    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\
    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)

You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you
can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then
XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.

I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I
used TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I
described above should work.

  SGI (IRIX 4.0.2) 
  IBM (AIX 3.2)
  Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).
  DEC Ultrix.
  DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).

Documentation is available online.

Changes since 0.13 include:

 o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Sun's that
   coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
   their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
 o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
   window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
   themselves. 
 o Better visited anchor color for non-SGI's. 
 o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
 o Added 'Clear' button to Open box, to allow more convenient
   cut-n-paste entries of URL's. 
 o New resource 'autoPlaceWindows'; if set to False, new document
   view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
   program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
   they're placed). 
 o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
   resource initialWindowIconic can also be used). 
 o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
 o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed. 
 o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
   (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that something's not
   right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
   in any case). 
 o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A
   HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed. 
 o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns. 
 o Fixed stupid coredump on URL's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'.

	    Compiled by Art Mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This ""FAQ"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    ""System Performance Tuning"" by Mike Loukides.  IMHO, it contains a
    well-written, comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm
    unaware of any other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the ""Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup"" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document

-----------------------------
What about the ""Other X FAQ""?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.

                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to ""xrdb"" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.""
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! ""

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   ""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

		      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu ""mouse settings"" {
        ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title
	""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &""
	""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &""
	""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &""
	""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &""
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?
- - - - - - 
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

----------------------------
Other Sources of Information
----------------------------

  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System
  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):
    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""Improving X
    Application Performance"" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in
    Issue 3 of The X Resource.

    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992
    conference proceedings.

    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.

Will there be no chance to get the Author of this _REALLY_ superb program
to remove the 'institutional' point in his license statement ?
Or at least to say 'except educational ones' at this ?

I understand that use of this software by either commercial or governmental
users should be result in a donation to its creator, but the everytime
rare on money universities, schools or whatever else institutions should
not be restricted.

If the situation stays as is and the Author explicitely states that
he treats universities and schools as institutions in this context,
i'll have to fallback to xv 2.21 here. Maybe our disk capacity will
soon be dead, when every user has a copy of xv-3.00 in his home dir...

Subject: How to get 24bit color with xview frames ?
Organization: Case Western Reserve University
Lines: 55
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: amethyst.ces.cwru.edu

Hi !

I am using Xview 3.0 on a Sparc IPX under Openwindows along with a XVideo board
from Parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. I am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

I use Xview to create a Frame and then create a canvas pane inside which I use
to display live video. My video input is 24 bit color.

The problem is that my top level frame created as
	frame = (Frame) xv_create(NULL,FRAME,NULL);
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
I tried using the following Xlib code :

XVisualInfo visual_info;
int depth = 24;
Colormap colormap;
XSetWindowAttributes attribs;
unsigned long valuemask = 0;
Window *win;
Xv_opaque frame;

win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID);
XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);

/* So far so good */

colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);

/* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */

attribs.colormap = colormap;
valuemask |= CWColormap;
XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);


Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?

Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

Thanks again,


Alok.

Subject: Creating Your own ColorMap, i.e. Lookup Table in X11 R4

Hello,

Below I have the copy of some source I am using to setup a user-specified color-
map for X R11 V4. I am attempting to create user defined colors in terms of
RGB color ranges. The calls to XAllocColor prove ineffective. 

Variables are defined are as follows:

    int                 i, j, k, lut_index
    color_type          min_image, max_image;
    color_type          image Pixel_Value_Range, last_image, start, end, jump,
                        lut [ 512 ];
    unsigned long       pixel;
    double              red, green, blue;

/*
 * Data structure used by color operations

        unsigned long pixel;
        unsigned short red, green, blue;

to work within the call to XAllocColor:

    start.red = (int) 255 * min_image.red;	/* 0..255 */
    end.red   = (int) 255 * max_image.red;	/* 0..255 */

I've had some problems with the mail system). Apologies if this appears
for the second time:

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints
---> Robert

PS: I'm working in plain X, using tvtwm.

  The MIT tapes come with documentation written by Keith Packard on the Shared
  Memory Extension to X. Look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
  shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an
  extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
  test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
  in the kernel. I have written layers of convience routines which make all this
  transparent.
  As for the XView code, well, I doubt that would be considered interesting.
  The interesting stuff is done in a C object library. People interested in this
  code can Email me.

Subject: Cannot create 24 plane window
Organization: Niels Bohr Institute and Nordita, Copenhagen
Lines: 59

    Hello X'ers

I have a problem: I am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. The
following code illustrates the problem:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <X11/Xutil.h>

main()
{
        Display *display;
        Window win;
        XVisualInfo vinfo;
        Colormap colormap;
        XSetWindowAttributes attributes;
        XEvent event;
        Status status;

        display=XOpenDisplay(NULL);
        status=XMatchVisualInfo(display,DefaultScreen(display),24,TrueColor,
                &vinfo);
        if (!status){
                fprintf(stderr,""Visual not found\n"");
                exit(1);
        }
        colormap=XCreateColormap(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),
                vinfo.visual,AllocNone);

        attributes.colormap=colormap;

        win=XCreateWindow(display,DefaultRootWindow(display),0,0,100,100,
                0,24,InputOutput,vinfo.visual,CWColormap,&attributes);
        XMapWindow(display,win);
        for (;;){
                XNextEvent(display,&event);
        }
}

I tried this with an SGI with 24 plane TrueColor server, and with an HP
9000-700 24 plane DirectColor server (with the obviously neccessary change),
both running X11R4. On the client side, I have tried with X11R4 Xlib on
HP 9000-700 and DECstation, and with X11R3 Xlib on DECstation. All the
combinations gave BadMatch error on the CreateWindow request.

As far as I can tell from the manual, the only attribute which may give
a BadMatch, is the colormap, if it belongs to a wrong visual. But the
visual was correctly matched, as I did not get the error message. What
am I doing wrong? For information I can tell that xwud aborts with the
same error.

Well, yes and no.  I don't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate, but I do think it's worth pointing out that ""popular
usage"" is not always sufficient excuse.  

In this case, for example, I think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  Probably
not.  

The same is true of X.  ""The X Window System"", ""X"", ""X11"", and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name.  In fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  The fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  

As for the trade publications that promulgate things like ""X Window"" or
""X.windows"" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
*journalists*.  Would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  Would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?

Popular usage is as it may be, but I for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

X11 technically superior to NeWS?  Well, in *some* alternate universe
perhaps ...

Hi,

I am using xdm on X11R5 with OW3 and Xview3 on Sun3s and SPARCs running 
SunOS 4.1.1.  Prior to using xdm, I used to set PATH and other environment
variables (like MANPATH, HELPPATH, ARCH, etc) in my .login file.  With xdm,
the .login file doesn't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
root-window nor my applications know about these variables.

I used the ""DisplayManager._0.userPath"" resource in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config
to succesfully pass the PATH variable.  But I am having problems passing anything else!!!  I tried execing $HOME/.login in /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession
but that didn't help.  I also tried using
	""DisplayManager.exportList: HELPPATH MANPATH ARCH""
which didn't work either.

I would appreciate any help on this matter.

Thanks in advance,
Shash

EPS _IS_ plain postscript. It is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility. You can simply do

%!

save gsave
/showpage {} def

% Include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

% end of file

and this way show it on it's natural page position and size.

Programs may use the %%BoundingBox: comment in the EPS file to do
arbitrary scale, rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above.

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events
--------------------------------------------

To produce regression tests or automatic demo's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user. It should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
an to store them in a file.
This sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given 
to the server's queue as if a user is working.


1. Exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
   mouse and keyboard events (where)?

2. Where one can catch these events to store them ?
   In our case the server's queue is on a X Terminal (HP).
   Where can we catch all events coming from a given
   server.
   If this is not possible, can we catch all events given
   to a certain client and how ?
   
3. Where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?
   Is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
   all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?


Thanks in advance

  The OpenLook window manager source is available on the MIT contrib tapes

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

I have heard of two packages for the PC that support X-Win.
The first is Linux which is a free Unix Package.  The Second
is X-Appeal, which sounds pretty good.  It can be found at
 garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  The files are

	xap13exe.zip
	xap10fon.zip
	drivers.zip

This should get you started.

Obviously, most of this is due to the problem encountered while including 
<sys/ucontext.h> - I've tried several approaches, but can't get past this point.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Is it possible to run an MIT R5 based Xserver on a Sun with a Rasterops TC
Colorboard (24bit board)?  I have the Xsun24 patches for supporting sun's
24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
something else?  I know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
buying one to put in an IPX.

I have two Motif Widgets. I would like to control one of them via the
keyboard and the other with the mouse. I set the keyboard focus on the first
widget, but as soon as I click the mouse on the second one, I lose the
keyboard focus on the first one. 

Could some kind soul show me how to do this?

	I got a few requests asking for a summary, so I'll attempt one
here:


	Here's the ones I know of:

	Wind/U		- Bristol Technologies

	Hunter SDK	- Hunter Systems

	MainWin		- MainSoft

	LIBWXM          - Visual Solutions


	Hunter 

	The company is going through some big changes.  I expect
to eventually see the Hunter SDK pop up with a new name.  At the moment, it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
Hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 

	Visual Solutions

	LIBWXM is a product that I just heard about.  They don't
yet support MDI or MFC.  Libwxm was used to port VisSim, a mathematical
modeling package.  Does native Motif Widgets, like Wind/U from Bristol.
Contact Carrie Lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  She's very helpful.

	MainSoft

	This translates Windows source to a Unix executable that
can switch off between a Windows or Quasi-Motif look and feel at
runtime.  They skip the Xt and Xm (Motif) X toolkit levels and go
straight to Xlib.  They don't yet support MFC.  They're at 415 896 0708.

	Bristol

	This company that seems to be on the right track.  Wind/U uses
Xlib/Xt/Xm to give a *real* Motif app.  They seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like DDE, Common Dialogs, and more on the horizon.
My contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain X widgets from Windows handles.
They're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.

We had the same problem and on most of our machines it works if we use

  Correct. Most X servers use a version of  malloc(3)  which will not return
  memory to the OS (ie. the X server might  free(3)  a Pixmap, but the heap does
  not shrink).

  Well, part of the routines I mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
  that problem. First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,
  attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man
  pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment
  only dies after all attachments are gone.
  Now, if the client dies, that's one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)
  and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up it's resources,
  including detaching from the segment: there goes the last attachment. No more
  shared memory segment.
  Terrible, but it works.

Can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications
BESIDES I.C.C.M.?

I've looked everywhere I can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody SHOWS you how.  O'Reilly has no examples, ICCM has no examples,
Asente & Swick give no examples - in fact most of the books I've looked at,
if they discuss ICC at all, simply give a condensed version of the ICCM and
then refer you to the ICCM.  I did find one example of how to use Atoms and 
Properties in Young's book and five hours after I bought Young's book I had
my applications talking to each other.

I am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  I'd like to stay independent 
of Unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  But within X
one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.

I need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
for which purpose, and gives examples.  Without examples it's all just words.

Thanks in advance

Very interested indeed! This is against this kind of ""changes"" that the GNU
COPYLEFT is protecting us.

Anyway, at SIMULOG, we will abandon xv. We were using it mostly for slide-

from the *wonderful* ImageMagick package! :-D), but I think I will implement
it myself (even a shell-script should do the job) and forget xv.

As I've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree's until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).

You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this
is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,
you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. 
Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...
TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep
processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically
re-installed.  

Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since
events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you
are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and
should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt).

What I like about GUI's:

	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files,
	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way
	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...

	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible
	  and accessable at the same time.

	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with
	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally
	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use.
	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do
	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is
	  a long and painful experience.


What I hate about GUI's:

	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess
	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a
	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something
	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my
	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be
	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting,
	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I
	  need to use both hands for is entering text.

	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons
	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.

A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should
never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having
some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable
from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is
called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top)
{
        Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars
        XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class
        int junk = 0;
        Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,
                                        NULL);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        topone,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(topone);
        for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when ""Exit"" button clicked
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(box);
        XtCloseDisplay(dis);
}

// SetItUp - should be called once only
void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top)
{
        int junk = 0;
        (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);
}

// doit - some library function callable from the outside
void doit()
{
        static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called
        static Widget top;

        static int setup = 0;

        if (!setup)
        {
                SetItUp(&app, &top);
                setup = 1;
        }
        bla(app, top);
}

// main - program which links to my library
main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
                doit();
                printf(""sleeping...\n"");//widget still on screen at this point
                sleep(5);
        }
}


The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(It is still on the screen -- unusuable -- during the ""sleep"" in the main prog,
despite the XtDestroyWidget call).

Anyone see something I'm missing?

Thanks very much.

I don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the Sun User
Group makes X11R5 available on CD-ROM to its members. The 1992.1 disk
has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  I've tagged a
table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

SUG CD 1992.1 is X11R5 and GNU on a CDROM, priced at $50 to SUG
members, including a caddy!

SUG's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk
contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries,
almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net
postings, priced at only $250.

Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
available later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains
a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a
SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
within the US or $55 outside.

The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
total of 543MB of material, including:

X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0
distribution are included (109MB of material).  Binaries for: X Xsun

COPIES OF CONTRIBUTED X SOURCES (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212MB).
These are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of
production of this disk) included in the MIT contrib-2 and contrib-3
distributions.

GNU SOURCES WHICH WERE uncompressed/untarred into source directories
(88MB).

Subject: Mix GL with X (Xlib,Xt,mwm)
Organization: The Internet
Lines: 38
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu


I am developing an X (Xt,Xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  A pure X application
could be implemented with Motif widgets, one of which would be an 
XmDrawingArea for drawing with Xlib.  But I would like to take advantage of
the Graphics Library (GL) available on our IBM RS/6000 (SGI's GL i believe).

Is it possible to mix X and GL in one application program?
Can I use GL subroutines in an XmDrawingArea or in an X window opened by me
with XOpenWindow?

I have never used GL before, but the doc on GL winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   Also, most of
the GL calls do not require a Display or GC, unlike most X calls.  From this
initial information it appears that X and GL cannot be mixed easily.   Is this
true?

Does PEX (graPHIGS?) have the same functionality of GL?


Environment:
     AIXwindows X11R4
     Motif 1.1
     GL is available
     AIX Sys V 3.2
     IBM RS/6000 360

It might be that the X terminal doesn't support the ""Postscript
Extensions to X"" product.  I use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
DECstation 5000 to view postscript files but when I moved to an
NCD X terminal, I couldn't use it any more.  So I ftp'd and
compiled GhostScript (GNU software).  Now we can view postscript
files on our X terminals.

Hope this helps.

Depends on the nature of the ""rounding.""  X allows the user to do bit
arithmetic on pixel values, (i.e.,  XOR foreground and backgroun pixel
values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
function of GXxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa).
If your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then 
clients that use them will break.

Get ghostscript and ghostview.  Ghostview is a postscript previewer
that uses ghostscript.

From the ghostview README:



    Ghostview -- An X11 user interface for ghostscript.

Ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.

Brief list of features:
  - Ghostview parses any known version of Adobe's Document Structuring
    Conventions.
  - Page size is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Window size is set to the bounding box for Encapsulated PostScript figures.
  - Default page size is Letter and can be changed via Xresources or
    application defaults file to A4 (or any other valid size) for our
    European friends.
  - Scrollbars appear when necessary.
  - Page orientation is automatically determined from the Document Structuring
    Comments.  The user is able to override the values from the comments.
  - Ability to view at 4 orientations: Portrait, Landscape, Upside-down,
    and Seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).
  - Ability to preview in any supported visual.  (Can preview in gray-scale 
    or color on a Color monitor.)
  - Ability to mark pages for printing, or saving.  (Good for people that
    printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)
  - Can popup zoom windows at printer resolution
    (1 display dot = 1 printer dot).

    The Ghostview distribution includes a Ghostview Widget that people
    are encouraged to use in other programs.

    Ghostview-1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from:
        prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z
        appenzell.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/ghostview-1.3.tar.Z


From the ghostscript README:

*****************************************************
* This file describes version 2.4.1 of Ghostscript. *
*****************************************************

********
******** An overview of Ghostscript ********
********

Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

        - An interpreter for the Ghostscript language, which very
closely resembles the PostScript (TM) language; and

        - A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the Ghostscript language.

The Ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in C, with some assembly-language accelerators for MS-DOS platforms.
Currently, Ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families:

        - IBM PC and compatibles with EGA, VGA, SuperVGA, or compatible
          graphics under MS-DOS 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0;

        - A wide variety of Unix systems using X Windows version 11,
          release 3, 4, and 5, including Sun-3, Sun-4, Sun-386i,
          Sun SPARCStation 1; generic 80386 machines running 386/ix;
          H-P 9000/300 and 9000/800; DECStation 2100 and 3100; VAX
          running Ultrix; Sequent Symmetry; Convex C1 and C2;
          Tektronix 4300; SGI Iris Indigo;

        - Sun workstations (Sun-3, SPARC, Sun-386i) running SunView;

        - VAX, VMS with X11R3/4/5, gcc and DEC C compiler (DEC C compiler
          version 3.1 or later is required).


(Get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
is because that's what the ICCCM says they should do.

This code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window?

I would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. This version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that I find really handy even
on large monitors. 

This version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.Z.
The README file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.

In my case, I built the X Server first, Xview second, then olvwm. All of these
were installed into /usr/X5. Once I verified the server worked correctly,
I happily issued ""rm -rf /usr/openwin/*"".

Using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
is, for all intents and purposes, identical to OpenWindows 3.0 and that is     
incredibly faster. There is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work _exactly_ like OpenWindows, but not much.

     You  should  try  having  a  .xsession  script in $HOME to do these
things.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version
(usually /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xsession), which should check whether you have
your won and change to that if you do.  (Take a copy of the  system  one
and edit it). 

     Note, that this file requires ""x"" access to be set.

I need to have PCs and SPARCstations run the same application ( namely

I would like to know your experiences with using DESQview/X to run an

We are making a transition from NextStep to X-windows. I am trying to find the best GUI tool for our needs.  I have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). I realize that there are differences but I don't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. The tools I have looked at so far are UIM/X, X-designer, Tele-Use, tcl/tk,Interviews, and SUIT. 
So far I've drawn the following conclusions:

1) The builder for Interviews is not very mature, bad docs
2) Tele-Use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
3) UIM/X & X-designer seem about the same, even though X-designer does not have a interpreter (I'll by Centerline if I need one)
4) tcl/tk is a little buggy
5) I know very little about the ICS Builder (just have the sales info)
6) Due to a corporate agreement X-designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.
7) For the time I'm spending I could have bought all of them (well different money)
8) We will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
9) this type of tool seems great, but noone seems to talk about them on the net. Is there another news group for this ?
10) SUIT cost too much for comercial development.

I'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.

thanks

The application creates window with a button ""Quit"" and ""Press me"".
The button ""Press me"" pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of
this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the

it is *much* slower.

Has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why I get

Anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.
It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look
ugly until it's window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications
are having to make do with it's colormap.

This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have
seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.
My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color (if this is an option for the application).

	It has been a long time since I wrote a program using X. I am trying to

 The simple program I tried to compile is given below.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>
#include <X11/Xaw/Form.h>

main(argc,argv)

	frame = XtCreateManagedWidget(""Form"",formWidgetClass,topLevel,NULL,0);
	XtRealizeWidget(topLevel);
	XtMainLoop();
}




	I got the same error when I tried to build ""xpostit"" using the Imakefile
	provided with the software.

	I have compiled X programs before (not on this machine, but on other 
	machines running sunOS 4.0 and X11 R4). I did not get this error message
	Can anybody tell me why I am getting these messages.

	I would appreciate if you can email your responses to me at

The 4-bit server should work fine.  As far as I know, Xterminals
running older versions can run the latest apps as long as the host 
machine has the R5 libraries installed. I could be wrong though.

Thanks to Bruce Barnett, who recommended xvttool, and Bernward Averwald and
Liam Quin, who recommended modifying .Xdefaults to get the desired behavior
for a *class* of xterms.

In xvttool, simply create a key file that looks like:
""a""	""A""
""b""	""B""
""c""	""C""
...
and specify said key file on the command line.  This will translate
any input into any other (in my case, lo-case to up-case).  Works great, and
you get a customizable button-pad on the right or left side.

To use an xterm solution, add to your .Xdefaults:
capxterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
   <Key>a: string(""A"")\n\
   ...

or:
capxterm.vt100.translations: #override \n\
        <Key>a: insert-string(A) \n\
        <Key>b: insert-string(B) \n\
        ...

and invoke as: xterm -name capxterm

Thanks loads!

I'm trying to turn on Xauthorization using MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE on my servers
(CPU heads, HP700RX Xterminals), but I'm running into a couple of problems.

First, at least one of our applications (Maple) doesn't seem to understand 
how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization
turned on. 

Second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and I
really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .Xauthority
file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support
Xauthorization.

So, what I would like to do is turn on MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE by default, with
non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based
authorization.

(Yes, I know how to turn it off by changing the Xconfig file for the
heads and the Client Authorize setting for the Xterminals, but
non-privileged users can't do this.)

I've checked with the HP Support Line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.
Can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what I
want?

BTW, I'm running HPUX 9.0, and Vue 3.0.

Thanks in advance,
Rick

So what? I'm running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box. I cannot make out ANY
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this 
application is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software.

I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.

When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.

Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.

When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly
updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application
gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.

Everything works fine with X11R4.

Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)?
Is it something I do wrong?
Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)?
Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

[[ I posted this a few weeks back, but all I got back was an error

With renewed interest in ""setting the DISPLAY variable"", etc.. I
thought I would post my contribution.

This Perl script is my solution.  It trys to be intelligent about
what it's doing so that you should be able to type ""rx host.domain.etc"",
and get a xterm running on ""host.domain.etc"", with all the difficult
stuff taken care of.

In theory, this program can do *everything* you ever wanted to do
when you wanted to run a remote command in the background - it
doesn't even need to be an X program.  Try a ""rx big-machine make""
for instance, for a backgrounded make on the remote ""big-machine"".

X
XCopyright 1992 Duncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk>
X
XTrivial to install, but there's an Imakefile to make it even more trivial.
X
XThe perl script needs some customisation before it is installed, just
Xedit the ""rx.pl"" file, and read the comments.  Once you've done
Xthis you can ""xmkmf"", then ""make install install.man"".
X
XFEATURES:
X
X*) Does the right thing for off-site remote execution.  Including
X   setting up $DISPLAY to include domain names, and passing
X   magic cookies, or doing the ""xhost"" stuff.
X
X*) Allow different remote user name.  (rx -l user host ...)
X
X*) Smart quoting of arguments - makes passing wild-cards easy.
X
X*) Custom command execution - link it to ""remacs"" to get a remote
X   emacs command.
X
X*) Automatic xterm options - names the xterm according to hostname,
X   and turns on ""login shell"".
X
X*) Default command is xterm.
X
X*) Propagates X-ish env. variables to remote session - user may
X   extend the list of variables to pass.
X
X*) Special handling for bourne shell users.
X
X*) Tries to do remote execution from same directory as local.
X   That is, it propagates $PWD, in an intelligent manner.
X
X*) Logs errors in a file.
X
X*) Overall Intelligence (TM) - makes reasoned decisions about what
X   you are trying to do, and tries to ""do the right thing"".
X
X*) Written in Perl, for portability and hackability.

X.SH NAME
Xrx,rxterm,r* - remote command, xterm, anything execution
X.SH SYNOPSIS
X.B rx
X[
X.B \-l
X.I username
X]
X.I host
X[
X.I command
X]
X.br
X.B rxterm
X[
X.B \-l
X.I username
X]
X.I host
X[
X.IR args .\|.\|.
X]
X.SH DESCRIPTION
XThe 
X.B rx
Xprogram connect to the specified
X.I host
Xand executes the specified
X.I command
Xin the background, returning immediately.  To allow the execution
Xof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to
Xthe remote session.  If you omit
X.IR command ,
Xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The
X.B rxterm
Xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes
X.I args
Xto the remote xterm as arguments.
X.PP
XShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local
Xmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
Xmachine.
X.PP
XIf the name of the file from which
X.B rx
Xis executed is anything other than ``rx,''
X.B rx
Xtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command
Xto run on the remote host, using any
X.I command
Xparameters as arguments for the remote command.
X.PP
XIf
X.B rx
Xthinks you are using
X.B xauth
Xbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or
Xto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization
Xkey to the remote account.  Otherwise it will try to use
X.B xhost(1)
Xto grant access to the remote host.
X.SH OPTIONS
X.TP
X.BI \-l "" username""
XUse
X.I username
Xas the remote username instead of your local username.  In the absence
Xof this option, the remote username is the same as your local username.
X
X.SH ENVIRONMENT
XIf set, the values of PATH, DISPLAY, XENVIRONMENT, XAPPLRESDIR,
XXFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, OPENWINHOME, LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
Xand XAUTHORITY are exported to the remote program, unless the
Xremote username is different, or the remote host is off-site, in which
Xcase only DISPLAY is exported, with in all cases any variables named in the
Xvariable RXENV.
X.PP
XThe DISPLAY variable is tweaked as appropriate, to contain as qualified
Xa hostname as is needed.
X.SH DIAGNOSTICS
X.TP
X.IB command "": don't recognise my name.""
X.B rx
Xcannot decode the name it has been called under.  In this case
Xit prints a warning message, and continues, as normal.
X.TP
X.B ""rx: usage: rx [-l username] hostname [args...]""
XThis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.
X.SH AUTHOR
XDuncan Sinclair <sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk>, July 1992
X.br
XOriginally based on a program with the same name from the
X.B gwm
Xdistribution.  To distinguish this ""rx"" from other programs
Xwith similar names, you should refer to this program as the
X.B Glasgow
X.BR rx .
X.SH ""SEE ALSO""
XX(1), rsh(1), xterm(1), xauth(1), xhost(1), gwm(1)
X.SH BUGS
X.B Rx
Xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the
Xlocal user, and the remote one, depending on whether the remote
Xhost is onsite or not, and whether an alternative username was used
Xor not.
X.PP
XIn particular, if either the locally used shell, or the remotely
Xused shell is the standard Bourne Shell,
X.B sh(1)
Xthen strange things are more likely to happen.  Especially when 
Xit's only one of them.
X.PP
XSometimes quoting can get messed up.
X.PP
XIt's too easy to fool the smarts in
X.B rx
Xto make it believe something that is not true, and fail because of it.
X.PP
XWhen
X.B rx
Xuses
X.B xhost
Xto grant access, the
X.B xhost
Xcommand may fail silently.
X.PP
XIf
X.B rx
Xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine, it will
Xlikely fail with a parse error from csh.  If this happens, you
Xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

X# remote execution of X programs.  Based on a script in an old version of gwm.
X#
X# To install, put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it.
X#  Some configuration will be necessary, see ""CONFIG"" comments...
X#
X# More and more this is less and less like the original....
X#
X# Major hacked to work for our(my) set up, and also partly
X#  re-written to work with sh, rather than ksh.
X#
X# Maybe I'll turn this into our first zsh script!
X#
X# Looks like it turned into a perl script at some point - big improvement.
X##############################################################################
X# This code tries to be intelligent in the way it works.  This means there
X#  are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in.
X#  These assumptions are all valid on the machines I use, and in my
X#  environment.  At the same time, I try to make as few assumptions as possible
X#  about the remote machine.  Here's a list of all the more tricky ones...
X# *) That the remote machine has csh.  (Linux?)
X# *) That $RSHELL = /bin/(k)?sh ==> remote shell = /bin/(k)?sh.  (Make same.)
X# *) If remote shell = sh, that $PATH is compatible.  (Use csh, etc..)
X# *) I pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be, but does it
X#    know what to do with a cookie. (eat it?)
X# *) There must be others...
X##############################################################################
X# Why am I using csh to run the remote commands?  Simply because it doesn't
X#  interact badly with rsh, and hang waiting for a file descriptor to
X#  be closed.  I'd rather use zsh, or bash, or even perl, but they are not
X#  as universal as csh.

Subject: X/GL widget translation problem
Article-I.D.: opus.9304221524.AA05029
Organization: The Internet
Lines: 14
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

I am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics
and imagery.  The user of the widget will be able to specify,
when creating it, whether it is to operate in X or GL mode.

I have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button
presses.  They work fine when the widget is in X mode.  In GL 
mode they only work when the widget (my GL/X widget) is a child
of a manager.  Put another way, the translations do not work 
when the widget is configured in GL mode and is a child of a 
shell.  Does anyone know why this is happening?

Thanks in advance.

NCD just announced a new generation of PC-Xview. They
changed the name a little though and I can't remember
exactly... PC-Xsomething.

It now supports Windows and their press release
implies that since it's still priced in the $500 range
and it's so feature-full why buy anything else?

The only time I've seen similar behaviour is when an X application forked a child
without setting close on exec on the X display connection file descriptor.
The shell waited for a ConfigureNotify event that never arrived because it got
picked up by the child.  Sometimes the shell correctly got the ConfigureNotify if
the timing was 'right'.

The Only directory I know of that lists commercial and non-commercial
widgets is the ICS Widget Data book.  ICS sells the widgets for various
prices.  There are also some public domain widgets in the delivery. 

The ICS Widget databook is a subscription kind of thing, where 
you pay some nominal fee, get a cd with the widgets and then you 
can use the public domain widgets freely, and selectively activate 
widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them. 
The nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets
such as those used in dataviews.  I dont know there pricing schemes
but It is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex 
widgets, especially if you only one customer to distribute to. 

This is the extent that I know about them except that I got their 
databook catalog  and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)

I dont work for ICS or have any widgets being sold by them.
hope this helps you.

I've used X11R5 with classics set for both 1024x768 and 1152x900 (you
can choose which resolution you want in the PROM monitor before
booting).  One person had trouble with X11R5 that was fixed by

Subject: Creating application contexts multiple times???
Nntp-Posting-Host: bruno.cs.colorado.edu

The subject does not describe the problem I am having very well.  Please read
on...

I am trying to write a function which creates an XtAppContext and a Widget,
displays the widget for a while, then destroys everything and returns.  The
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including (depending on which calls I make to get rid of things):

- Core Dump
- BadPixmap X Error
- Widget not unmapped


Here is a simple (C++) program I wrote to show the problem:

#include <X11/Xlib.h>
#include <Xm/Xm.h>
#include <Xm/PushB.h>

void bla()
{
        XtAppContext app;
        Display *dis = XOpenDisplay("""");
        int junk = 0;

        Widget top=XtAppInitialize (&app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,
                NULL, NULL, 0);

        Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                        top,
                        XmNheight, 50,
                        XmNwidth, 50,
                        NULL);

        XtRealizeWidget(top);
        //Same as XtAppMainLoop but with only 10 XEvents
        for (int i=0;i<=10;i++)
        {
                XEvent event;
                XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);
                XtDispatchEvent(&event);
        }

// WHAT SHOULD I PUT HERE???
        XtUnrealizeWidget(top);
        XtDestroyWidget(top);
        XtDestroyApplicationContext(app);
        XCloseDisplay(dis);
// ???
}

main()
{
        for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)
                bla();
}

Note that I rewrote XtAppMainLoop so that at a given time (in this example,
after 10 XEvents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
With this example, I get the following error on about (this is NOT consistent)
the 5th call to bla():

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xe0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  86

If I take out the XtUnrealizeWidget(top); line, it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

Furthermore, every time I call XtAppInitialize() (other than the 1st time), I
get:

Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice.


So finally, my question is this:

What needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an XtAppContext and widgets multiple times?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PLEASE respond via email as I dont usually have time to read this group.

Thanks very much.

At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3
and OpenWindows 2.0.

This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For
example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2
display, I can't open the compose window.

I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes,
we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start
the X programs.

Is there a ""ready to go"" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration
(I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by
myself?

Any help is welcome

Hi!

Personally, I like NeXTSTEP very much. Even more when I realise how much a  
burden ordinary X or Windows programming is. I also like Objective-C better  
than I like C++.

But, sometimes the restrictions are there. For instance it sometimes has to be  
MS-Windows or X. Now I'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments  
that come close to NeXTSTEP, the appkit etc. Also, environs that support rapid  
prototyping (like with IB) without producing spaghetti-code as soon as you want  
to do real work.

Maybe STEPSTONE with some Windows version of a kit of UI objects? Interviews  
(what it is exactly, I don't know. I kind of lost touch with that world when I  
started with NeXTSTEP.)

Thanks,

From the XmTextField man page (during discussion of resources):

   XmNverifyBell

      Specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
      during a verification callback.

You are setting doit to false in the callback, and Text[Field] is beeping
as it should.  To turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.

Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor
exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.

Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: 

  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, 
  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, 
  Doug Young, and many others.

Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional
conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object
Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server
technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;
and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing
applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many
desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be
evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and
suppliers.

The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference
at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide
the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX
developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is
the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you
what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.

I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience
is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a
confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.

Granted it's nothing to loose sleep over, but this is Ethernet's tragic flaw:
the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity), the more collisions
happen and the performance gets exponentially worse...  I am just now
opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet.  Although in a polling
system it would not be so bad.

You'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each

you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock
modifier).

I don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then
one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.

X doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 

Hope that helps,

Okay, that's good.  I'm typing this from exactly the same setup.

Make sure you're using ""ssetroot"", which comes with tvtwm.  When tvtwm
starts up, it nukes the existing root window.  Use an ""ssetroot"" after
tvtwm starts up.   (You could spawn off a ""(sleep 10; ssetroot ...)&"")
You can also use ""VirtualDesktopBackgroundPixmap filename"" or just
VirtualDesktopBackground if you just want another color besides grey.

Did you install the sunkbd patch?  It's in the contrib directory on export.
All the keys on my keyboard send events properly, except the following:
The End, PageUp, PageDown on the 6-key cluster aren't recognized.
Even the compose key works.  (Though I can't seem to get the composed
characters in an xterm to get passed.)

Anyone have a fix for the last two?

I use it all day every day (maintaining our ftp site and answering mail
via support@qdeck.com), and I can honestly say that in the last few
months I've never had my machine go down due to any sort of tcpip network
manager instability. (Of course, I've crashed my machine quite a few times
on purpose, during beta testing and that sort of thing, but the tcpip
portion is quite stable...)

However, keep in mind that DVX and the network managers are only going
to be as stable as the software they sit on top of (so if your underlying
network kernel is flakey, you can't expect DVX to be terribly stable...)

It just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it. (To vastly
over-simplify what goes on, we just take the windows graphics API calls,
and translate them directly to X-protocol; unfortunately, windows was
not really written to be network-aware, so sometimes we see a speed
penalty when an app does something stupid, like sending a big white bitmap
to erase something rather than just drawing a white box; fortunately,
that sort of thing is rare...)

You need to run MS windows, which Word then runs inside. You could run
multiple windows programs within the one WinX window, and windows has
ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows, so in practice
it's not really a major problem. I have my system set up so that I can
run WinX, which automatically starts Word Full-screen (for windows), so
I never see any part of windows but word...)

NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert <xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu>

Hi Xperts,

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem? 

Any help is very much appreciated.

Try to run Xsun under truss(1).

	The best way to do this is by logging in over the network
	and typing:

	truss -t open Xsun

open(""/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/fonts.dir"", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8

open(""/opt/X11R5/lib/X11/fonts/misc/cursor.pcf"", O_RDONLY, 0666) = 8

This will give you and idea of where Xsun things the fonts should be.

If you have defined  a project root and done a make install, everything

Bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.
One of major flaws of X is the horrendous number of transactions (and
hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  Actual measurements
(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to
20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is
filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
many processes are needed for each character.)

While a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like
10 process switches per second per user.  This is a significant increase
in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working
set.  If you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many
as 50.

If you want to go there, I wouldn't start from here!

	I want to be able to send a Pixmap from one client to the next.
Along with this I want to send the Colormap and foreground and
background pixel values.  So far not a problem, I can do
this with no problem.

  However, once I have the Pixmap id and the Colormap id, how
do I go about telling the server that the second (receiving)
client now wants to have associations with the two id's?

I just had an idea. I'm not sure if its been done and I'm just
remembering it unconsiously, but I thought that in dialog
boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a
way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
filled in a certain way. My idea: tape. You know, like putting
a piece of tape over a light switch?
Just an idea, if you like it, use it.

Subject: Q: Colormaps with dialog shells
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 17


I have an applicationShell which uses a colormap created with
XCreateColormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
display.  When I move the cursor over the window I get the ""Technicolor
Effect"" - which is fine.  Basically, my program works.

My problem/question is: When I popup a dialogShell to prompt the user for
some input I want the XmNdialogStyle to be set to
XmDIALOG_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_MODAL.  The result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogShell I get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
applicationShell (or any window other than the dialogShell) I get the
default colormap.  But I'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
window of my application, I get my colormap.

Any suggestions?  Thanks,

david,

Hi, Experts, 

I'm kind of new to X. The following question is strange to me. I am
trying to modify the contents of the colormap but failed without
reason (to me). I am using the following piece of code:


  toplevel = XtInitialize(argv[0], ""Testcolor"", NULL, 0,
			  &argc, argv);
  dpy = XtDisplay(toplevel);
  scr = DefaultScreen(dpy);
  def_colormap = DefaultColormap(dpy,scr);

  if(XAllocColorCells(dpy, def_colormap, True, NULL, 0, cells, 5)) {
    color.pixel = cells[0];
    color.red = 250;
    color.green = 125;
    color.blue = 0;
    color.flags = DoRed | DoGreen | DoBlue;
    XStoreColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);
    printf(""\n Try to allocate, the color %d as (%d,%d,%d)"",
	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); 

    XQueryColor(dpy, def_colormap, &color);
    printf(""\n After  allocate, the color %d is (%d,%d,%d)"",
	   color.pixel, color.red, color.green, color.blue); 
  }
  else
    printf(""\n Error: couldn't allocate color cells"");


Running output:

     Try to allocate, the color 7 as (250,125,0)
     After  allocate, the color 7 is (0,0,0)

After XStoreColor(), XQueryColor() just returned the original value. 
No failure/error displayed but the contents of colormap are obvious
unchanged. (I also tried to draw a line using the colors but it 
turned out to be the unmodified colors.)

So what is my problem? How to modify the contents of the colormap?

Any help/information will be appreciated. Please send mail to

The following problem is really bugging me,

I create two windows:

w1 (child to root) with event_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;
w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = ButtonPressMask|KeyPressMask;


Keypress events in w2 are discarded, but ButtonPress events fall through
to w1, with subwindow set to w2.

FYI, I'm using xnews/olvwm.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here?

Animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident XImages into 
server resident Pixmap(s) using XPutImage.  Once this is done, the original XImages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using XCopyArea from the Pixmaps to the windows drawable.

Hope this is helpfull.

One usual suggestion is to put everything into your every-time shell rc-file
instead of your login-only one, which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what they're doing.  If you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them, though, then it's confusing at best.  Another is to
have your xterms run login shells, but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.

Our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts,
it runs the user's favourite shell as a login shell, and has *it* then run the
rest of the startup scripts.  That way the user's usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything.  You can find an almost-current copy
of our scripts and things in contrib/edinburgh-environment.tar.Z, available
from the usual places.

In plain Motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. You need
to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. In the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 

XView from Sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'Notify' box, which can
return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
driven style of an application.

I don't have a problem with this.  John Bradley has put a *hell*

Had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the IJG JPEG
code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have
observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
and commercial software.  Sam Leffler's libtiff copyright also grants
permission for unrestricted use including resale.

""Commercial""?  There's a big difference between a polite request

I do agree that John's readme file could be a little clearer about

Hello folks,

I'm seeing these errors when I try to modify my key map:

mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x

I've added a line in the start up file before the line
that starts mwm. It looks like the following:

xmodmap keymapfile
mwm

I think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
function keys F1 through F7 which already have assigned
functions (e.g. Move, Minimize, etc).

The odd thing is that I don't see these errors if I run

xmodmap keymapfile

from an xterm.

Can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
F1 through F7 AND not have mwm (Motif Window Manager) complain.

I realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
implement, not time to learn how to implement.

Subject: Xw widget set ported to X11R5??
Organization: Varco-Pruden Buildings
Lines: 14

I'm trying to compile xftp which uses the Xw widget set and I'm having
problems.  We're using Motif and X11R5 and it seems that my version of the
Xw stuff was only ported to R3.  Are there patches out to port this to R5
(or a newer port altogether)??

Or perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with R5??
Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to set up an IPX for another group. I copied all the
X stuff that I compiled on my 4/280 (which runs SunOS 4.1.1) using
gcc 2.1, and most things run just fine. however, I did find a
couple of bugs, and when I try to recompile those clients on the IPX
(which runs 4.1.3), I get

ld: Undefined symbol
   _XShapeQueryExtension
   _XShapeCombineMask

I know that I can include libXext and get rid of those messages,
but I can't figure out why I get them on the IPX and not on the
4/280. any ideas?

How much support do you need?  I don't think there's anything
that prohibits you from implementing such a widget, though you
will have to write your own versions of the functions that draw
the 3D shadow and traversal highlighting.

I've installed many X apps, and have that many of them Imakefiles that have

the Makefile also has the XCOMM (comment?) lines in them. I always have
to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. I was

Subject: X Toolkits
Organization: University of Waterloo
Lines: 29

I am considering making a reasonably large application for free
distribution (probably copylefted).  I am going to use X.  Now I'm
bewildered by the huge number of ""standards"" that ""open systems"" has
created.  

I've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  Most of the tools
here were produced with the Athena Widget set, or X Intrinsics or Xw
(??).  

In my humble opinion, they look like crap.  I don't know, however, if
this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste
in the programmers.

I would like my app to look a little more ""sculptured"" like mwm.  I
understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits.

I am getting Linux, so I will have InterViews, but I don't know how it
will look.  I get the impression Andrew is from the FSF, but I don't
know what it looks like either.

If you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, I would be much
obliged.  Which are free?  Which are the best?  Which are portable?  Which
looks nice?  Which is not a resource hog?

Also, if you happen to know which are available on Linux and/or Sun,
that would be a big help too.

Thanks in advance.

What does this have to do with my original question???  I previously
stated that I did an XCopyArea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  This is NOT
a problem with expose events, it has to do with XCopyPlane not
working!!!

Does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
XCopyPlane works???  This would be very helpful!

Thanks!

Hi.  I've looked in the FAQ and the O-Reilly books and was unable to
find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as
CapsLock and NumLock.  I can certainly track the events inside of my
window and set a boolean there, but what if CapsLock is pressed in
another window?  I looked at XGrabKey() and decided it was definitely
NOT what I wanted to do.  I could find no convenience function to tell
me that information.

My question is this:  Is there a means of determining what the state
of CapsLock and/or NumLock is?

An even more pointed question: Is there an easy means of making an X
keyboard act like a PC keyboard?  ie, CapsLock is active, and the user
presses shift-a, I'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'A'.

Any input is greatly appreciated. Please respond via email.  I will
repost a summary of my findings.

Most graphics systems I have seen have drawing routines that also specify
a color for drawing, like

Drawpoint(x,y,color) or Drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or
Fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) 

With X, I have to do something like 
XSetForeground(current_color)
XDrawPoint(d,w,x,y)

Why split this into two functions? Why did X designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on?

X
X    In order to be included in this file for given year, we must
X    receive a current description no EARLIER than Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC and
X    no LATER than Feb 15 00:00:00 UTC.  Agreement to publish your

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest   
X    
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated 
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X 
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X 
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X 
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that mearly works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X 
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical 
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X 
X    The contest rules are posted to comp.unix.wizards, comp.lang.c,
X    misc.misc, alt.sources and comp.sources.d.  If you do not have access 
X    to these groups, or if you missed the early March posting, you may 
X    request a copy from the judges, via Email, at;
X 
X        judges@toad.com   -or-   ...!{sun,uunet,utzoo,pyramid}!hoptoad!judges

X                         Alena Lacova (alena@nikhef.nl)
X
X    A  contest of  programming skills  and  knowledge, exclusively  for the
X    PostScript programming language. Its purpose:
X
X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.
X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at
X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript
X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High
X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands. She is  the author of

we did not install DECnet onto them, which the Xdec server on gatekeeper

Subject: Xterm Problem With Input Focus / ""Shuffle Up""
Keywords: Xterm, Tektronics, Input Focus, Shuffle up
Organization: Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester NY
Lines: 41
Nntp-Posting-Host: b56vxg
News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41


The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An option
in the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats
a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while
the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be ""Tek-term"") is
active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the 
Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of
Xterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  

The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics 
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move 
the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve 
screen space, it stays an icon.


The desired behavior: one of two options - 

    1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the 
       inactive one.

    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon
       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher 
       level than the Xterm.

What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.
These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the 
command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.

Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb 
X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.

Thanks for your time.  If you've got any words of wisdom (other than 
""give up"" ;-), please send email to

What I want to be able to do is to set the cursor
color to the same as the forground color that is set
for that xterm.

From the man page.....

-cr color
 This option specifies the color to use for text cur-
 sor.   The  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <---
 color that is used for text.  <---

However this doesnt seem to be the case, it appears to default to black
or to whatever XTerm*cursorColor is set to.

Here's what I (think) have figured out.  All I need to do is install
the R5 disitribution without the Xserver like the sony.cf file defines,
and all the new libraries, utils, etc., will be installed and my old
server from r4 will still work.  This will allow me to run Xview 3.0,
and have X11r5 up and running.  Does the server interface remain the
same with all changes made only to the libs?

Another question: Is it likely that since Sun is dropping OW support
that the desktop utils (like the file manager) will be made public?
It would be nice if companies would make old code public for the

See xwd, xpr.  Even better, grab xdump from ftp.cs.uwm.edu.  It makes use 
of these programs as well, but has a much nicer interface (and can do more).
You can dump to PostScript, bitmaps, etc.

I have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes

my X Application. I tried
to invoke this server using XtAddAppTimeout which works ok. But the
problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. So I doesn't
returns to EventLoop during that time and my application remains busy and
It doesn't respond to users input. I button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task. Now I am going to try AppAddInput
call. So that It reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.

I am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my X application will read. Now I have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify.

1) When I fork a process. It will create to copy of my process. Right !!
   Now what does this two copies mean? Two Shells. Where should I fork
   my application. What are the responsibilities of this processes. How
   should I call this processes.?

2) Can I fork more than one processes. So that I can read from more

The terminals will be connected to a DEC 3000/400 AXP with 96Mb RAM,

as much as possible in the terminal itself (X11, window manager, xterm,

(where n ranges from 4 to 10, depending on who I talk to).

In X10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.

This caused problems with performance and network traffic,
so the X11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state.  Most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a GC for
each color during initialization, then pass the GC id in
each drawing request.

For more information see Scheifler and Gettys's article
in the 1986 ACM Transactions on Graphics.

HPGL does not support raster primitives, so a formatter would have to

Probably I have started the compilation Prozess only with a wrong

Hello Motif World,

a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got
several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people
who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am
not aware of who are also using Motif++.

My question is:

How many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the
user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
changed.

If you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say
about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will
post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.

Lines: 27

I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I
decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling
XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).
I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis
it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString
was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor
was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.
We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.

Many X servers supporting graphics accelerators do not allow the creation

	Several ways are available -- pageview (which I think came

the new xv 3.00 package all do so.  I recommend the latter two,

Subject: Problem with MIT-SHM
Organization: Boston University
Lines: 27

I am trying to write an image display program that uses
the MIT shared memory extension.  The shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.
But the program crashes at the first call to XShmPutImage,
with the following message:

X Error of failed request:  BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  133 (MIT-SHM)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)
  Segment id in failed request 0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  741
  Current serial number in output stream:  742

Like I said, I did error checking on all the calls to shmget
and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory
segment, as well as checking XShmAttach.  There are no
problems.

If anybody has had the same problem or has used MIT-SHM without
having the same problem, please let me know.

By the way, I am running OpenWindows 3.0 on a Sun Sparc2.

Thanks in advance--
John C.

   ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based
   formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and
   action-based, and the other symbol-based.

True, but that's beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model
of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing.
This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer*
of the system. (NB: some users may see it, too, but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

I'm not saying that the programmer's perspective is evil or stunted. After
all, that's what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully
distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system. 


   I don't recall the actual stats, but something like 1 in 5 people can be
   categorized as a ""symbol manipulator"".

It would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. At any rate, I don't think this is evidence that 20% of users think
like programmers. Bankers, financial analysts, structural engineers ---
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. But what they do is not programming, and programming is not
required to do what they do. 

To restate my previous point: yes, users want to build their own solutions;
no, they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two
       headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries
			under /XFree86/SVR4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86
		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/ISC
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries
			under /pub/linux/packages/X11
		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries
			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries
			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi""
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

Hello, 

	way back in the mists of time, I had a set of patches written
by Richard Caley (I believe to the standars distribution, patch level
6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon
regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function. I still
have the patches, however, I can no longer find the sources to which
they applied ;-). 

	I'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to
where I could find the sources. Has anyone updated the patches for R5?
(Richard? are you out there? pretty please?)

	Thanks in advance.

Subject: German keyboard ALT-GR ?
Keywords: ALT-GR german keyboard
Organization: Leibniz-Rechenzentrum, Muenchen (Germany)
Lines: 25


Hi ppl,

I am running XFree386 under Linux SLS1.0 and am trying to get the german
keyboard working. I have already recompiled my kernel and the german
keyboard in the textmode works just fine.
I have found out, that there is a preconfigured german keymap for X
called Xmodmap.gr in /usr/lib/X11, so I ran xmodmap /usr/lib/X11/Xmodmap.gr.
My first impression was very good, I was able to get Z and Y straight :)
There's still a little problem I can't solve however:
I cannot get at the backslash, bar, brackets and curly brackets.
The ALT-GR key doesn't seem to work.
I tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.
Looking up its keycode (113) in the Xmodmap I found the entry ""Mode_switch""
which doesn't ring any bell. The entries for the keys I cannot use seem
to be correct. Example: keycode XX = ssharp questn backslash
The first 2 entries I can even get at. The first one is the unmodified
key and the second is the key with shift, but what is the 3rd??
My guess is that it should be the key with ALT-GR but it isn't.
If anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them,
help would be appreciated.

I assume that you are literally trying to create a widget of type
textWidgetClass. Use the AsciiText widget instead.

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib
graphics on the window.

It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to
send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,
you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the
new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region
to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn. Keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look.

Hope it helps

Subject: R5 table widget causing trouble with XtQueryGeometry
Organization: Universitaet Koblenz
Lines: 227
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: glass.uni-koblenz.de

Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5

	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version
	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).
	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error
	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the
	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 
	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 
	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).
	
	Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered
			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
			to do about?

	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me. 
	Germans are requested to answer in german.

Hmmm.... Clearly?  Depends on your programming model.  It is not at all
forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  Certainly any
internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
to be generated.  This doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
updating the datastructures though...

Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() 
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the 
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same 
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be 
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above 
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless 
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They 
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple 
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not 
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X
X		...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!obfuscate
X		obfuscate@toad.com
X
X       We request that your message use the subject 'ioccc entry'.
X
X       If possible, we request that you hold off on Emailing your entries
X       until 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.  Early entries will be accepted, however.
X       We will attempt to email a confirmation to the the first author for
X       all entries received after 1-Mar-93 0:00 UTC.
X
X    9) Each person may submit up to 8 entries per contest year.  Each entry
X       must be sent in a separate Email letter.
X
X   10) Entries requiring human interaction to be built are not allowed.  
X       Compiling an entry produce a file (or files) which may be executed.
X
X   11) Programs that require special privileges (setuid, setgid, super-user,
X       special owner or group) are not allowed.

X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Guidelines, Hints and Comments

XAll Rights Reserved.  Permission for personal, education or non-profit use is

XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers 
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with 
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor 
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you 
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in 
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.
X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of 
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You 
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the 
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X    
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer 
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as 
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many 
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry 
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, 
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners 
X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

I have a SPARC-2 with 2 CGSIX cards in it.  I'd like
to have the R5 server recognize the second card.


I mknod created a /dev/cgsix1 device, but when I brought up the
server, the second device was ignored.  

How do I setup the second card?


Note:  If I borrow a cgthree card, and put a cgthree and
a cgsix card in the same SPARC-2 box, the R5 server finds
the second card. I then set the DISPLAY to the
second card, and start a second window manager.  

Worse case is I trade cards with someone, but maybe someone
out there has seen this problem already...


email is preferred... post if you must...

Thanks in advance....

this is a repost... I like to find out more about this also...

*** Message Part 2: Text ****************************************
The COSE announcement specifies that Motif will become the common
GUI. But what does this mean exactly?
 
- Do they mean that all ""COSE-complient"" apps will have the Motif
  look and feel?
 
- Do they mean that all ""COSE-complient"" apps will use the Motif
  toolkit API?
 
- Do they mean both of the above?
 
- Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with
  an OpenLook Look & Feel?
 
- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
  (I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)
 
- Will there be more than one ""standard"" toolkit API or L & F supported?
 
- How does using ToolTalk fit in with Motif?
 
This is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much
knowledge about these questions off the net... Feel free to e-mail

Subject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?

	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window 
or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. 
The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr 
client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:
		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the 
command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for 
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]

	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of 
arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]
is the most recent.
	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders 
XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;
see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.
	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: 
soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.
	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.

	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,
which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps
and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for 
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and
contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive
servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.

	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and
save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.

	Also: 

	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter 
2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.

	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-
capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and 
non-PostScript printers.

	Some vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) 
include session managers or other desktop programs which include ""print portion
of screen"" or ""take a snapshot"" options. Some platforms also have tools which 
can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, 
have a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals 
have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.

	Some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct 
support for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package 
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?

	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can 
	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color 
PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv 
	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.
You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick 
distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?

	This can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider 
instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?

	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ 
Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting 
among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, 
gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;
the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.
	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in 
particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.
It's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a
version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are 
later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  
Graeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; 
see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.

	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), 
can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, 
GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, 
contrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned 
formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on 
it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; 
see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.
Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available
via FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, 
and ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.

	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads
and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image
manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.

	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar 
to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, 
weedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.

	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential 
interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is 
a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and 
Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, 
xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.

	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from 
export's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF
from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.

	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written
to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining
simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed
as part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.

	A version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool
is available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package 
also includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] 

[some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov), 5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?

	The solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
	A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:
		echo ""ESC]2;TEXT^G""
where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,
and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).

	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories:
		alias newcd 'cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G'

	The digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should 
change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name 
used in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the 
icon name.

	Note: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the
escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.

	Note: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a ^V.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?

The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file 
ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.

O'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control 
sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of 
the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. [1/93]

Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document
and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a 
compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 
sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was 
published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).

In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

[last updated 10/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?

	In order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to 
""stty pass8"" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as 
	XTerm*font: 	-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
	XTerm*boldfont:	-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1
[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]

In addition, you may want to set this in your shell:
	setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1

        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with 
the Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using
`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') 
is Alt-'.

Subject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?

	You are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give 
a resource specification like this:
		xterm*geometry: 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. 
But its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:
		xterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?

	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. 
However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for 
manipulating the selection will help; e.g. 
	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a 
window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. A version is on export.
	Also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be
adapted to do this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?

	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are 
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and 
XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for 
application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most
one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from
the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a 
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also 
have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could 
set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up 
app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):
	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see 
XtResolvePathname()):

        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the
                application's class name.
        %T      The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the
                literal string ""app-defaults""
        %C      customization resource (R5 only)
        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")
        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")
        %t      The territory part of the display's language string
        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string

	Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is 
""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the 
example omits locale-specific lookup.)
	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above 
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it 
and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to 
search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

	Let's consider another example. This time, let's set 
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working 
directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.
	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands 
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging 
because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file 
Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and
%S are useless.

	With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization 
resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like this:
	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""

	If one of your pathname specifications had the value
""/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character 
takes on the value of the customization resource.

	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

	(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in
this batch of default settings.)

	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 
		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory 
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other 
than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find 
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR 
to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 
compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed 
by a slash.

Subject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?

The answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources; for example, 
your /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line 
	DisplayManager.0.authorize: false 
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also 
	DisplayManager*xrdb:	/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:
	#!/bin/sh
	#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources
	/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap
	/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*
Substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

Subject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?

	When xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login
files. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;
or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,
if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your 
.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with ""#!/bin/csh"". 
	If this doesn't work, also try starting off with:
		#!/bin/sh
		# Reset path:
		PATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?

	There are several ways to avoid having to do a ""setenv DISPLAY ...""
whenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.
	One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It 
includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and
xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.
	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from
132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and
$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then 
propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
		eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special 
format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to 
recreate the environment variables. [11/90]

	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on 
another host, and you find
		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY 
too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh 
can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be 
		xrsh <HOST> xterm

  #! /bin/sh
  # start an X11 process on another host
  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT
  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>
  # rsh $host -n ""setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null""
  #
  # An improved version:
  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)
  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)
  #
  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.  This

Subject:  38)  How can I design my own font?

	One way is to use the ""bitmap"" client or some other bitmap-editor (e.g.
Sun's icon-editor tool, post-processed with pbmplus) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post-processing to concatenate 
them into the BDF format. See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X 
Journal for more information.
	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained 
a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
	An easier way is to use the ""xfed"" client to modify an existing font; a
version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], 
possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce
BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.
	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,
XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed 
[5/91] in export:/contrib. 
	If you are a MetaFont user you can use ""mftobdf"" from the SeeTeX
distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
	The GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,
a font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
	The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
	Fonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?

	After you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, 
installed it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp 
$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the 
directory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably 
leaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in 
the path.)
	Sometimes your ""xset +fp $dir"" command fails with a BadValue error:
		X Error of failed request:BadValue
			(integer parameter out of range for operation)
		Major opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)

	This means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The
mention of an ""integer parameter"" in the message is spurious.)

-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file
   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your
   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. ""xset +fp ~/myfonts"") and
   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.

-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server
   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
   ""fonts.dir"".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're
   running OpenWindows, look for the file ""Families.list"".  If you can't find
   it, run bldfamily(1).)

-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a
   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for
   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.
   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for
   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work
   for X11Rn.

Subject:  40)  How do I convert a "".snf"" font back to "".bdf"" font?

	A tool called ""snftobdf 1.4"" is part of the bdftools package, which is 
available from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from 
crl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?

	der Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and 
produces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be 
used as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can 
understand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools 
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail 
from mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]
	In addition, the R5 program ""fstobdf"" can produce bdf for any font that
the R5 server has access to.

Subject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?

	The DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to
standard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file 
contrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is 
for a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for 
creating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers 
which do not use the MIT font scheme.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  43)  How do I add "".bdf"" fonts to my DECwindows server?

	The format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the "".pcf"" format.
You can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc
font-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a
performance hit.

Subject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)
I want to be able to do something like this:
	xclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave

	You can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the 
same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because 
of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since 
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, 
neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap 
converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a 
resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for 
use in many of its widgets, however.
[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]

However:
	A specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of 
the xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick 
(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of 
image formats as a pixmap.

	The leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used 
by Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by
AT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM 
distribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write 
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information
on the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on 
the R5 contrib tape. [A set of XPM icons collected by Anthony Thyssen

	However, the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the

	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a site

Forgive me if this is a FAQ (I have checked the list but I cant find it).

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors)
The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block, but how do you do this. I can't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
This would also be preferable but I can't seem to force this to be the
default either.

Configuration is  : Motorola 88K X11R4

Please reply by email if poss.

Thank you

If only MIT would fix the !@&$^*@ twm ""InstallWindowColormaps()"" crash bug
once and for all, then I could say that I've (almost) unable to crash either
""twm"" or ""tvtwm"", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to

Now *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an OpenWindows 3.0 ""xnews""
server at will?  Just do an 'xbiff -xrm ""XBiff*shapeWindow: on""'.  Blammo.)

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is
run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?

That are the authorisation files for the server.
Depending on what type of key your X supports they contain magic cookies,
DES based authentication or SUN DES authentication.

The place is defined with the DisplayManager.authDir 
Other things like the file name can be changed as well see XDM manual pages.

	How do you handling scaling of X text while performing zooming

I've recently joined the Motif world, so I'd like a similar tool for

I posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. Can anybody help me out?

How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says ""For information
on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4..."", this is so you
know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to
Vol. 4 it says, ""Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For
example, the translation:

	Shift<Key>q:	quit()

will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the Shift key (and the q key).

This implies to me that setting XmNaccelerator to Ctrl<Key>o should do
what I want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the
control key, the shift key, and the o key.

Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? Keep in
mind when answering this question that when using Motif you can't use
XtInstallAccelerators().

I am using Motif 1.1.3 on a DECstation 5000 but I have also tried it
on an HP using Motif 1.1.3 and 1.2.

I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the

daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a
color ""front"" screen from the cgfour, and a mono ""back"" screen from the
bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono
monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the
bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the ""back"" screen on the color tube from the
bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if this is
possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before?

This would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
file (I can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
to the X source), and could make your own bold font from this.  Since each
glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph ""bold"", and
convert the results back to .bdf format.  Then, use ""bdftopcf"" to create
the .pcf file.  Then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc (or wherever)
and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!

Hi *,

Has anyone out there compile a list of X security holes??  If
yes, will you please send me a copy of this??  If this is a
wrong group, please point me to a right one.  Thanks!!

BTW, the list doesn't have to contain the info ""How to use
the holes?"".  Instead, I need the info of how to detect
the holes, how to seal the holes, and how to monitor the 
activities if possible.

Any info is welcomed.  Thanks!!

I've found that I have to add the ""-8"" option for displaying JPEGs
with the new version.  For some reason, if I don't, it goes into
24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors 
(from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  Since I'm
on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display I would have thought it
could tell that.

Anyway, have a look onto xgrab/xgrabsc. It does the IMHO best job for

I am wondering how to change the English fonts in an existed

Someone told me X11R5 supports some internationalization
features, but I cannot find any examples for my need. Is there
anybody has done some similar jobs ?

By the way, all the English fonts should be replace by Chinese or
Japanese fonts, that means in windows, menubar, button....

That will be great if someone can share us what you have done.

Does XDM work with DECnet? I have an Ultrix machine running both TCP/IP
and DECnet. I have a number of X-terminals hanging off the Ultrix host also
running TCP/IP and DECnet. Presently I am using XDM for the login procedure
on the X-terminals using TCP/IP. Since XDM is basically just an X-windows
client, shouldn't I be able to run XDM on the DECnet protocol tower as well?

My first inclination is that XDM is not your typical X client. It is making
TCP/IP specific socket calls. In this case the answer would be no; you can
not run XDM over DECnet. Is this right or not? Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks.

What ""it may think is right"" may be exactly what the user wants.
Assuming that your application ""has reason to know better"" is, IMHO,
anti-social.  If I start your application with a -geometry option are
you going to ignore that as well?

There's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
if it's managing your window.  You can ask, you can hint, but there's
no guarantee that you're going to get what you want.

	Because xterminals do not have a NeWS server.  xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add NeWS and
everything else, you have a workstation.  There are workarounds, I've
heard, one involving a perl script.  What we are trying to do is
replace programs that need NeWS (like pageview) with programs that
don't (like ghostview).
	Maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; I
have no personal experience with it.

Our group is interested in using a 'pixmap' format for multi-colored
icons/buttons etc that is easily converted to and from other format from
'resource' files. Using pbmplus we can easily move to/from Xpm to our other
environments of MS-Windows and OS/2 PM :-(. We were wondering if Xpm or some
other format is under consideration to be used as a standard by the X
consortium for R6 as we would prefer to use whatever will be best supported by
X. 

Along the same subject line, is the reason the standard X pixmap is not used
because it doesn't have an associated colormap and other attributes? or is it
more involved? just wondering why there aren't editors for pixmaps out there
for the 'original' format.

Email replies preferred. Thanks in advance.

X
XHow to have your contest included in this file:
X
X    If you wish the IOCCC judges to include your contest in this file,
X    send a request to:
X
X	judges@toad.com
X
X    We request that contest descriptions be limited to 50 lines and to
X    not exceed 2500 bytes.  We typically request that your contest
X    include a current description of the IOCCC.
X
X    In order to be included in this file for given year, we must
X    receive a current description no EARLIER than Jan 1 00:00:00 UTC and
X    no LATER than Feb 15 00:00:00 UTC.  Agreement to publish your
X    contest must also be obtained prior to Feb 15.  Annual contests

X    10th International Obfuscated C Contest
X
X	""The original obfuscated contest""
X
X    Obfuscate:  tr.v.  -cated, -cating, -cates.  1. a.  To render obscure.
X                b.  To darken.  2. To confuse:  Their emotions obfuscated
X		their judgment.  [LLat. obfuscare, to darken : ob(intensive) +
X                Lat. fuscare, to darken < fuscus, dark.] -obfuscation n.
X                obfuscatory adj.
X
X    GOALS OF THE CONTEST:
X
X        * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below.
X        * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way.
X        * To stress C compilers with unusual code.
X        * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language.
X        * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-)
X
X    The IOCCC is the grandfather of USENET programming contests.  Since
X    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works
X    correctly is not sufficient.  The IOCCC has also done much to add
X    the arcane word 'obfuscated' back into the English language.
X    (see ""The New Hacker's Dictionary"" by Eric Raymond)
X
X    You are strongly encouraged to read the new contest rules before
X    sending any entries.  The rules, and sometimes the contest Email
X    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may
X    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical
X    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not
X    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical
X    closing date for contests are in early May.
X
X    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to
X    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines
X    prior to submitting entries.  To obtain them, send Email to the address
X    above and use the subject 'send rules'.
X
X    One may obtain winners of previous contests (1984 to date), via ftp from:
X
X	host: ftp.uu.net	(192.48.96.9)
X	user: anonymous
X	pass: yourname@yourhost
X	dir:  ~/pub/ioccc
X
X    As a last resort, previous winners may be obtained by sending Email
X    to the above address.  Please use the subject 'send YEAR winners',
X    where YEAR is a single 4 digit year, a year range, or 'all'.

X    0th International Obfuscated Perl Contest
X	By: Landon Noll & Larry Wall
X
X    This content is being planned.  Someday when Landon & Larry are not too
X    busy, they will actually get around to posting the first set of rules!
X
X    Landon says: ""Yes, I know that I said we would have a contest in 1993,
X		  but other existing projects got in the way.  Hopefully
X		  something will be developed after Nov 1993.""

X                2nd International obFUsCaTeD POsTsCripT Contest
X                     Jonathan Monsarrat (jgm@cs.brown.edu)
X                         Alena Lacova (alena@nikhef.nl)
X
X    A  contest of  programming skills  and  knowledge, exclusively  for the
X    PostScript programming language. Its purpose:
X
X    * To spread knowledge of PostScript and its details.
X    * To applaud those with the best tricks.
X    * To prove  that humans can  beat those damnable  machine generators at
X      their own game by writing  the most obscure and mysterious PostScript
X      programs ever.
X
X    Winners will receive the fame and attention that goes with having their
X    program entry posted as a winner to programmers world-wide.
X
X    The 1993 contest rules and results are available by ftp as
X    ``wilma.cs.brown.edu:pub/postscript/obfuscated*.shar'', or individually
X    in the obfuscated directory. The judges will post the 1994 rules
X    in November to comp.lang.postscript on Usenet, and other places.
X    Send questions to jgm@cs.brown.edu.
X
X    Categories include: Best Obfuscated PostScript, Best Artwork,
X    Most Compact, Best Interactive Program, Most Useful, and
X    anything so unusual and creative that it deserves an award.
X
X    The judges will choose the winners of each category.
X
X    Alena Lacova  is a system  administrator at NIKHEF  (Institute for High
X    Energy and Nuclear  Physics) in the  Netherlands. She is  the author of
X    The PostScript Chaos  Programs, which draw  Julia sets, Mandelbrot sets
X    and other kinds of fractal functions.
X
X    Jonathan Monsarrat is a graduate  student from MIT and Brown University
X    in  the  U.S.A. He  is  the  FAQ maintainer  for  the  Usenet newsgroup

Subject:  58)! Where can I get patches to X11R5?

	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the 
newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in 
their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has 
23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request ""5a"", ""5b"", ""5c"" and 
""5d"" separately
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]
	3) fix 8 is in two parts: ""8a"" and ""8b""
	4) fix 13 is in three parts: ""13a"", ""13b"", and ""13c""
	5) fix 16 is in two parts: ""16a"" and ""16b""
	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which 
previously was optional
	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for ""PEXlib.uu.[1234]"".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, ""22a"" through ""22i""

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail 
it a request, and it mails back the response.
	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can 
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). 
The xstuff server treats the ""Subject:"" header line just like any other line 
of the message.
	The archives are organized into a series of directories and 
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an 
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command ""help"" or ""send help"" causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""index"", then 
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then 
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. 
For example, you can say ""send index fixes"" (or ""index fixes""). A message that 
requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""send"", then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name 
an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many 
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large 
amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the 
day's quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. 
Whenever the mailer is run to send its day's quota, it sends the requests out 
shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting 
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If 
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
        path bar!foo!frotz
in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If 
your mailer deals in ""!"" notation, try sending to 
{someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

Subject:  61)  Where can I get OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. 
	Motif 1.2.2 source is now available; it is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is currently [7/92] at 
1.1.5.
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.
	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest (408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 223 462 131) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting makes a kit for Sun systems.
	ICS (617-62-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	SILOGIC (+33 61.57.95.95) ships Motif 1.2 and Motif 1.1 on Sun 
machines.
	S.I. Systems offers Motif 1.2 for Solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
USA and Canada.
	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333, UniVision (UK) Ltd. (44) 628 82 22 81) ships an 
implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1.2 (including a shared-library 
implementation of libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.  Motif 1.1.2 is 
also available for Sun Sparc based workstations. It has also announced 
Motif 1.2 for Solaris systems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  62)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the ""vanilla"" X11R4 Intrinsics, where ""vanilla"" means ""with just a few 
patches""; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by MIT's patches 
15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its 
subsequent modification needs to be applied after MIT fix-18, though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are 
some known new geometry-management problems.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  63)  Where can I get toolkits implementing OPEN LOOK?

	Sun's XView has a SunView-style API. A version is on the X11R4 tape;
the latest [2/92] 3.0 sources are on export in contrib/xview3/.
	XView and X binaries for the Sun 386i (""roadrunner"") are available for 
ftp from svin01.win.tue.nl (131.155.70.70), directory pub/X11R4_386i.
	Supported binaries of XView 2.0 or 3.0 include: 

XView for non-Sun Platforms  (domestic and selected international vendors).
Several are also available from Sun; contact your local sales office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  64)! Where can I get other X sources? (including R5 modifications)

	The MIT Software Center ships the X Test Suite on tape.

	A multi-threaded version of Xlib based on X11R5 patch 12 is now 
available for anonymous FTP from (new version 1/93):
        DEC on gatekeeper.dec.com (16.1.0.2) in /pub/X11/contrib/mt-xlib-1.1
        MIT on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in /contrib/mt-xlib-1.1

	HP has made available drivers to permit the building of the X11R5
sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on
export.lcs.mit.edu in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check 
that group for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine export.lcs.mit.edu has a great deal of user-contributed
software in the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or 
earlier versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also
directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on export in
contrib/00-index.txt is a quick overall index of the software in that area,
provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).

	These sites used to and may still mirror export and are of particular 
use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: 
sirius.ua.oz.

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the export archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at TB+ 
and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp) for 
instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file ""/usrX/ls-lR.Z"".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file ""/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX"".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.
[courtesy Mark Snitily, 2/90]

In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and 
provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4"" tapes.  It 
also mirrors export/contrib in its packages/X directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  67)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

	Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a
WorkSpace or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt 
application know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received
user key and mouse input. 
	The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  
	At least one version has been posted to comp.sources.x (name???). 
	The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions. 
	The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution) 
includes a tutorial and source code to a simple widget which is suitable for 
use.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  75)  Where can I get an ""X terminal"" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh
exec >/dev/console 2>&1
/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0
case $? in
 	0)	;;
 	4)	/etc/reboot -q -n
 		;;

	Well, I know of one hack to sort of do this conversion.  First
get ghostscript and check out the gs_2asc.ps file that comes with it.
It prints out some information about where each text string goes on the
page, and maintains page counts.  I've written a little C program to
massage the output of gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps somewhat, so that you
can get all the ascii strings in the document.  No guarantees that it
won't break up words/sentences, though - I've used it with varying
degrees of success.  Anyways, try this out, it may do what you want.

/*
 * massager: a filter for use with gs; does crude Postscript->ASCII conversion
 *
 * Usage:
 *	cat file.ps | gs -dNODISPLAY gs_2asc.ps - | massager
 *
 * I print a <Ctrl-L> after each new page.
 *
 * Put the following source into massager.c and compile it:
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

main()
{
	char	line[1000], *p;

	while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin) != NULL)
		if (line[0] == 'P')
			printf(""\f\n"");
		else if (line[0] == 'S' && line[1] == ' ') {
			if ((p = strrchr(line, ')')) == NULL)
				continue;
			*p = '\0';
			if ((p = strchr(line, '(')) == NULL)
				continue;
			for (p++; *p; p++)
				if (*p != '\\' || (p[1] != ')' && p[1] != '('))
					putchar(*p);
			putchar('\n');
		}

	return(0);
}

Frequently-asked questions about the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface.

If your question isn't here, please try (at *least*)
	man openwin
	man xnews
	man 7 xview
and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the Bibliography below
before posting to the comp.windows.open-look, comp.windows.x or
alt.toolkits.xview newsgroups and/or their corresponding mailing lists.

Special Notes:
    * I have not updated this FAQ for the recently-announced OpenWindows 4,
      due to ship later this year.
    * Yes, Sun is moving to Motif, along with all of COSE.  But the Motif to
      which they move will be a new Motif, with some of the OPEN LOOK UI
      features added.
    * Yes, OpenWindows 4 will use DPS instead of NeWS.  NeWS is dead.
      This means TNT is dead, too.
    * XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the
      next release.  I don't know if there will be a source release of
      XView 3.1 or not.
    * The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet,
      ported to Motif.  Look for Calendar Manager and Mailtool, at least.
    * Yes, the new Mailtool will be MIME-compliant.

Frequently Asked Questions for X11 are posted to comp.windows.x monthly.

Subject: Terminology: OPEN LOOK, OpenWindows, X11, XView, OLIT, MOOLIT, Motif

@ What is OPEN LOOK?
    OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
    A GUI determines the `look and feel' of a system -- the shape of
    windows, buttons and scroll-bars, how you resize things, how you
    edit files, etc.

    The OPEN LOOK GUI is specified, developed and maintained jointly by
    Sun Microsystems and AT&T (or USL?).

    See Also:
	Bibliography

@ What is OpenWindows?
    OpenWindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the OPEN LOOK
    Graphical User Interface Specifications.  It's compatible with the
    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun's NeWS and SunView,
    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.
    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.
    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the
    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.
    It should not be called `Windows' or 'OPEN LOOK' or `OpenLook', as
    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.
    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,
    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.
    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:
	SunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0
	Solaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0
	Solaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1

    See Also:
	Mixing X11 and OpenWindows
	Where can I get it?

@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?
    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs
    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography
    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here's a brief summary:

    OLIT was AT&T's OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;
    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were
    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,
    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the
    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in
    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in
    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a
    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).
    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably
    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or
    anything else that uses subclasses.
    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]

    XView is Sun's toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in
    programmer interface to SunView.  There's even a shell script to help
    migrate source code from SunView to XView.	 XView is often said to be
    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.
    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is
    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).
    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.
    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the
    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be
    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.
    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much
    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.

    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based
    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the
    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of
    an application.  It's currently included in OpenWindows.

    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some
    incompatibilities with `tNt' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to
    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time
    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.
    You might ask what `is committed to' means in this context; the
    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.
    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.

    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++
    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from
    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify
    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be
    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the
    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.
    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of
    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in
    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).

@ Where does Motif fit in?
    It doesn't :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that
    is being developed by OSF.	It has a `look and feel' reminiscent of
    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-
    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold
    reasonably cheaply by OSF.	Although Motif is currently available on
    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly
    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a
    large installed base.
    Sun's CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif
    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in
    the `Periodic Table' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.

@ What is MoOLIT?
    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between
    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V
    Release 4.2.
    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677

@ What about that Display PostScript thing?
    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X
    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed
    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a
    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously
    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it
    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less
    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.
    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;
    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.
    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS
    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to
    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.
    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts
    available, however)

Subject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm

@ What are olwm and olvwm?
    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window
    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows
    on the screen, and for managing the user's interaction with the windows.

    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.
    It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and
    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.

    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the
    `v' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the
    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.	 You can
    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This
    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around
    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm
    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.
    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib
    directory; there are three patches).

@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?
    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won't be able to use
    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won't see the
    footers some windows use to display certain messages.

    If you use twm, you'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus
    and get rid of programs that don't have a `quit' button when not run
    under olwm.
    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:
	LeftTitleButton ""target"" = f.delete
    where ""target"" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.
    Alternatively, try
	# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm
	LeftTitleButton "":menu"" = f.menu ""OL.menu""

	menu ""OL.menu"" {
	    ""Quit""         f.delete
	}

    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title
    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).

    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).

Subject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays

@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?
    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.
    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.
    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS
    or SunView support, and thus won't run on an X terminal.  This includes
    pageview in particular.

    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-
    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)
    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about
    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.
    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you
    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal's
    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.


Subject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows
     
@ What configuration files do I need to know about?

    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc

    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in
    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to
    edit it somewhat; it's simplest to move it and any other old X11 files
    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.

    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,
    since xdm doesn't look at your .xinitrc file.

    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys

    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,
    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.
    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files
    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need
    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an
    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,
    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano's ""contool"" program so that
    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.
    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.

    .Xdefaults

    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,
    it is a good idea to include at least:
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true
	*Input: TRUE
    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they
    forget to ask for it.

    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default
    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.
    Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.

    .startup.ps

    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)
    on startup.	 This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the
    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change
    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a
    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up
    at all or will get broken in strange ways.	The NeWS manual gives code
    that is both incorrect and insufficient.
    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.

    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see
    the man page for xset (""man xset"", and ""xset -help"") for more information.

    Here's what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of
    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of
    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for
    OpenWindows 3.  You'll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime
    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn't include the time to
    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your
    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...

	% don't want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual
	% /IncludeDemos? false def

	UserProfile begin
	    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def
	    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def
	    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...
	end

    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:

	/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
	/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage

	ClassRepeatKeys pop	% force repeat.ps to autoload

	endpackage endpackage endpackage

    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the
    OpenWindows server like this:
	$ psh -i .startup.ps
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3
	$ psh -i
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3
	/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send
	%%% now press control-D

    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make
    the root window be ""retained"", so that a PostScript drawing on the
    background won't be erased when you move windows:
	frambuffer /Retained true put
    will do this.  Note that this may increase the amount of memory used
    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.

@ How can I configure OPEN LOOK for a left-handed mouse and keyboard?
    You can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons, but be prepared for one
    or two occasional surprises.  See also ""man 7 xview"" for a list of
    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.

    With OpenWindows 2.0, you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings
    and then let SunView handle them.  The status returned by svenv should
    tell you whether your server is running under SunView or not; put this
    in your .xinitrc:

    if eval `svenv -env`
    then
	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 1 2 3""
	input_from_defaults
    else
	xmodmap -e ""pointer = 3 2 1""
    fi


@ How can I get the screen to go blank when the system is idle?

    Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but
    effective screen saver.  See `man screenblank'.
    Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as
    it's not supplied.  Then add a new file in /etc/rc2.d to make the system
    run screenblank automatically.

Subject: Key Bindings, Cut and Paste

@ How do I cut and paste between XTerm and OpenWindows programs?

    To go from XTerm to textedit (say):
    * Select the text you want to copy by dragging the SELECT mouse button
      in xterm
    * Press COPY in the XTerm (this key is L6, or Meta+c (the O'Reilly
      XView manual gets this wrong)
    * Move to the textedit window, and press PASTE (L8 or Meta+v)

    If this doesn't work, see Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste

   To go the other way, from textedit to XTerm:
    * Select the text in textedit.  No need to use COPY
    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).
    * You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.

@ COPY/PASTE is boring.	 What short-cuts are available?

    Quick Copy within textedit, mailtool, etc:
    * Click SELECT to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go
    * Press and HOLD DOWN the PASTE (or CUT) button
    * Select the text you want to copy/move.  You'll see that it's underlined
      or crossed out, as appropriate.  (In the jed demo it goes grey)
    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.
    * The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.

    Drag and Drop to Move a Selection
    * Select the text you want to copy or move, by dragging or multiple-
      clicking the SELECT or ADJUST mouse button
    * Put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection
    * Press and HOLD DOWN down the SELECT mouse button, and move the mouse
      pointer a little to the right; you'll see the cursor changes to be the
      first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).
    * Still holding SELECT down, move the mouse over the point where you want
      to drop the text
    * You may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle-sight or target, to show
      that it's OK to drop things here
    * Let go of SELECT, and the text is moved.	This works in text fields of
      dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.

    Drag and Drop to Copy a Selection
    * This is the same as using Drag and Drop to Move a Selection, except that
      you must hold the CONTROL key down as well as the SELECT mouse button.

@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?

    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when
    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the
    right of the insert point.

	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)

	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word
	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word
	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line
	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document

    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default
    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.

@ What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?

    See the manual page for shelltool.

Subject: Applications: Finding Out...
    Contact SunSoft (or Sun) and ask for the Catalyst OPEN LOOK guide,
    which lists over 200 pages of applications, and also the _huge_
    Catalyst listing of products for Suns, updated six-monthly.

    Sun's free CDWare CD/ROMs each contain demo versions of several popular
    OPEN LOOK applications.  Often you can simply contact the vendor
    concerned to have the license upgraded from demo, and receive the full
    product documentation.

    SunPICS produces a CD/ROM for NeWSPrint users, Printer's Pallate, which
    contains NeWSprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters, as
    well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.

    There is a separate FAQ posting in comp.windows.open-look that lists
    a number of free and commercial aplications; mail lee@sq.com for a
    copy, including OPEN LOOK UI Application List in the Subject for a
    faster reply.

Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.

@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?
    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.
    If ""man cm_delete"" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under
    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.

@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?
    The best way is:
    $ cd
    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .
    $ chmod +w .textswrc
    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)
    add the follwing:
	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER
	cat ~/.signature
    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)

    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.



Subject: Fonts

@ Does OpenWindows support Type 1 PostScript fonts?
    Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).
    Or, Not Yet, in other words.

    If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.
    The 57 fonts supplied with OpenWindows are fully hinted, though, and
    comparing them to the Microsoft Windows and Apple TrueType fonts is
    interesting...  The F3 font format is described in a publication from the
    Sun OpenFonts group, listed in the Bibliography below.  Documentation on
    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.

    You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably
    other major foundries.

    SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.

@ Improving font rendering time
    Although the Sun type renderer (TypeScaler) is pretty fast, it's not as
    fast as loading a bitmap :-).  You can pre-generate bitmap fonts for sizes
    that you use a lot, and you can also alter and access the font cache
    parameters.	 If you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the
    font cache size.
	$ psh -i
	Welcome to X11/NeWS Version3 <--- psh will say this at you
	currentfontmem =	% type this line ...
	300	% and here's whai my server was using -- 300 Kbytes
	1024 setfontmem
	% Just to check:
	currentfontmem =
	1024
    See pp. 328ff of the NeWS 3.0 Programmer's Guide.  You need to say psh -i
    so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page.

@ Making bitmap fonts for faster startup:
	$ mkdir $HOME/myfonts
	$ cd $HOME/myfonts
	$ makeafb -20 -M $OPENWINHOME/lib/fonts/Bembo.f3b
	Creating Bembo20.afb
	$ convertfont -b Bembo20.afb
	Bembo20.afb->./Bembo20.fb
	Chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied.
	$ ls
	Bembo20.afb	Bembo20.fb	Synonyms.list
	$ bldfamily
	* Bembo		       ./Bembo.ff (Encoding: latin)
	cat: ./Compat.list: No such file or directory
	$ xset +fp `pwd`
	$ xset fp rehash

    If you want the server to see your new font directory every time,
    add this directory to your FONTPATH environment variable in one
    of your start-up files, e.g. .login or .profile.

@ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)
    You can also use Folio fonts with an X11 server, by converting them to a
    bitmap (X11 bdf format) first.  Your licence forbids you from using the
    fonts on another machine, and unless you have NeWSPrint you shouldn't
    use them for printing.  Having said all that...  you can use makeafb and
    convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or
    bdftopcf.

    Use mftobdf (from the SeeTeX distribution) to convert TeX pk fonts to
    X11 bdf format, which you can then use with either X11 or OenWindows.

    You can also use der Mouse's ""getbdf"" to get bdf fonts from a running
    X display server -- ftp: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) /X/getbdf

@ Xview/OLIT fonts at 100 dpi
    There aren't any.  More precisely, the various text fonts, such as
    Lucida Typewriter Sans, are available at 100 dpi, and in fact are
    scalable under OpenWindows.	 The glyph fonts are bitmaps, and don't
    scale very well.

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages

@ No manual entry for cm_lookup

    If man doesn't seem to find OpenWindows commands, even though you are
    running OpenWindows, try setting the MANPATH environment variable:
	MANPATH=$OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man; export MANPATH
    or
	setenv MANPATH $OPENWINHOME/share/man:/usr/man
    for csh users.  $OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.

@ window: Window creation failed to get new fd 
@ window: Base frame not passed parent window in environment 
@ Cannot create base frame.  Process aborted. 

    These messages all come from SunView programs.  SunView was an
    earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.  Some of
    the SunView programs are still around in /usr/bin, and have names
    that are the same as their OpenWindows counterparts.  You almost
    certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.

    Set your path so that $OPENWINHOME/bin (and $OPENWIN/bin/xview for
    OpenWindows 2) come before /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same), or
    you'll get the SunView versions of mailtool, cmdtool, shelltool, etc.

@ Trouble compiling Xt, Xmu or OLIT programs: _get_wmShellWidgetClass
 
    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), contact your local
    Sun office and request the following patches:
100512-02   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-03   4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libXmu

    If you can't install the patch, a workaround is to add 
	-u get_wmShellWidgetClass -u get_applicationShellWidgetClass
    on the link (ld or cc ... -o ...) line.  An alternative is to add
	-assert nodefinitions
    to CFLAGS in your Makefile, or even in Imake.tmpl.


Subject: Trouble Shooting: It Won't Let Me Type

@ When I try to type into some programs, I just get beeps or nothing happens
    It is a good idea to include at least:
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:	true
	*Input: TRUE
    in your .Xdefaults file, as these allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to
    receive input even if they forget to ask for it.
    See the next item for editing .Xdefaults

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Cut and Paste not working

@ I can't paste from xterm to XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs
    Under OpenWindows 2, you need to add the following either to your
    $HOME/.Xdefaults file, or to $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm instead:

	XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>L6:select-set(CLIPBOARD)\n\
		<Key>L8:insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
  
    You must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing
    L8 (the Paste key)!

    Under OpenWindows 3, this is already in the app-defaults file, so if it
    isn't working, check that XFILESEARCHPATH is set to
	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S
    and if it isn't, either set it or copy/merge the above lines from
    $OPENWINHOME/lib/app-defaults/XTerm into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.
    [See also: Environment Variables]

    This version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard:
	XTerm*VT100.translations: #override\n\
	    ~Ctrl ~Meta<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
	    ~Ctrl ~Meta<BtnUp>: select-end(PRIMARY,CUT_BUFFER0,CLIPBOARD)\n\
	    <KeyPress>L8: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)
    [Note: be sure that the \n\ is at the very end of the line, there must
     be no following spaces, and any + or | signs showing that this FAQ file
     was altered must also be removed!]

    If you are using X11R5, you may find that adding the lines
<Key>L10: start-extend() select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\
       <KeyRelease>L10: kill-selection() \n
    before the <KeyPress>L8 line will make L10 (CUT) work as a cut key!

    If you alter $HOME/.Xdefaults instead, you must use what X calls a
    `more specific' resource name:
	xterm.vt100.translations
    will do.

@ I can't paste from XView (including Sun DeskSet) programs to xterm

    If you don't have the Sun L keys on the left of your keyboard, you can
    use Meta-x, Meta-c and Meta-v for cut, coy and paste respectively.
    You can change the keys by adding the following two lines to
    your .Xdefaults file, edited as you wish (the values shown here are the
    defaults):

	Openwindows.KeyboardCommand.Copy: c+Meta,L6
	OpenWindows.KeyboardCommand.Paste"", ""v+Meta,L8
    
    Lists of resources are in the manual page for xview, and also in the
    thinnish blue book `Companion to Volume 7, XView Reference Manual' from
    O'Reilly, and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.

@ I always get the same piece of text when I press PASTE (L8, Meta+v)
    Remove the file /tmp/textsw_shelf and see if that helps; see also the
    next item.

@ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only)
    Oh dear.  Use ps -xuaww | grep xv  to check that sv_xv_sel_svc is running
    and that either you or root started it, depending on whether you started
    OpenWindows with ""openwin"" or by logging in through xdm.
    If not, start it.  If it dies, check that there is no /tmp/.sv_xv_sel_svc
    before restarting it - you may need to be root to remove it, or you can
    reboot your workstation.
    Check that there is space in /tmp (use ""df /tmp""), and also see if there
    are a lot of files there with names like /tmp/tty.txt.a01246; if there are
    several hundred of them, cut and paste may take so long that it times out.

    Quit any deskset tools such as mailtool, filemgr and cm (calendar), start
    a terminal emulator and remove and /tmp/tty.txt* and /tmp/Text* files
    that are still there.  It's simplest to quit openwin and start it again
    after doing that, if cut and paste was broken, but if it starts working
    again you can just carry on.  Note that files in /tmp not owned by you
    might be in use by another worker comrade, so don't remove those without
    checking first!

Subject: Trouble Shooting: Not authorized to use display

    If you get error messages that look like
	Xlib:  connection to "":0.0"" refused by server
	Xlib:  Internal error during connection authorization check
	Error: Can't Open display
    try, on the machine running OpenWindows or X11,
	xhost +machine
    where ""machine"" is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.
    If you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you,
    using your display, you will have to type the bizarre-looking
	xhost +`hostname`
    (or xhost +happyboy, if happyboy is the name of your workstation).
    This lets ANY user on `happyboy' access your display.

    With OpenWindows 3.0 you can also use xauth, and the Programmer's Guide 
    describes how to do this in Chapter 8, p. 101.  This is more secure.
    Also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the
    framebuffer directly!

    Also note that there is a Sun patch for OpenWindows 3.0 under SunOS 4.1.1
    to fix a serious security problem.  It is available through your local
    Sun Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net
    [192.48.96.2] system in /sun-dist:
    Fix                     PatchID        Filename            Checksum
    loadmodule              1076118        100448-01.tar.Z     04354  5


    On an X Terminal, there may be a setup menu that lets you change or
    disable the list of hosts that can access the display.

    If you start getting this message after you've been logged in overnight,
    there might be a cron job that's removing the Unix sockets in /tmp
    that are used to communicate with the server when $DISPLAY doesn't have
    a hostname before the :, or is empty.  Have the system administrator
    change the cron script to skip sockets.

Subject: Trouble Shooting: other common problems

@ I get console error messages on my screen and they don't go away (Sun 3 or 4)
    If ""refresh"" makes the messages vanish, but new ones come along later,
	you need to run ""xterm -C"" from your .xinitrc, or start one up in
	the background and then  choose Save Workspace from the
	Workspace->Utilities menu.  Better still, pick up ""contool"" and run
	that.  Get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory.  It
	will monitor the console and open, flash its icon or beep when a
	message appears; it's very easy to configure.

    If ""refresh"" from the Workspace->Utilities menu doesn't make the messages,
    go away...
	a Sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens - you can move the
	mouse off the right-hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto
	a whole new (but monochrome) display, called "":0.1"".  See the man.
	page for openwin; I have a shell script that checks for this and,
	if there's a /dev/cgfour0, does
		openwin -dev /dev/cgfour0 -dev /dev/bwtwo0
	If you are running X11 or OpenWindows 2, you might need to add this
	to your .xinitrc or other startup file:
	(
	    eval `svenv -display unix:0.1 -env`
	    olvwm -display unix:0.1
	) &
	Later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.
	You can also run switcher -e 0 to get rid of the messages.  Also, see
	the note about contool, above.

@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?
    Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.
    This starts `props', a property editor which will re-write your
    .Xdefaults after removing comments.  It then applies any changes.
    Keep comments by using ""comment."" instead of ""!"", for example,
	comment.*.font: Palatino-Italic-37

@ How do I get the File manager to use emacs instead of textedit?
    set the default editor to
	sh -c ""exec emacs -font lucidasanstypewriter-18 \""$FILE\""""
    (you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)

@ How do I run OpenWindows in inverse video?
    This tends not to work under OpenWindows 2.	 With OpwnWindows 3.0,
    there are various ways, including using -bg and -fg options.  If you're
    using OpenWindows 2 on a Sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of
    upgrading the workstation to a SPARC!) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.

@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?
    A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.
    A workaround is to edit the Guide output, as it's only Guide's output
    that's broken, not the actual check-box code.
    This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.  If you're
    still using an ancient DevGuide, you should upgrade as soon as possible;
    the new one is fantastic!

@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays
  on the screen.
    Try running clear_colormap; if this helps, put it as the last line in
    the shell script you use to start OpenWindows (e.g. `openwin').

@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.
    This was a bug related to some systems only.  The only work-round was to
    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.
    
@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?
    Keys F11 and F12 changed from SunF36 and SunF37 to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37
    respectively in OpenWindows 3.  Applications must be recompiled, or you
    might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to
    change your keyboard layout back again.

@ When I type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit, I get the Sunview version
    See under ""Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages"" below.

    (see also next item)

@ Mixing X11 and OpenWindows
    (see also next item)

    Note that OpenWindows 3.0 includes the X11R4 core distribution (to patch
    level 18), but not the contrib directory.  These notes apply to
    OpenWindows 2.0, although you could also the do same sort of thing with
    OpenWindows 3.0 and X11R5.

    Install the X11 libraries in /usr/lib/X11.	You can intermix OpenWindows
    and X11R4 or X11R5, they're all compatible in this respect.
    Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.

    Put /usr/bin/X11 last in your PATH, so that you get OpenWindows versions
    of programs instead of X11 ones where appropriate, although this is a
    matter of preference.  In any event, put the OpenWindows bin directory
    first -- see the preceding item for more details on that.  If you have
    /bin (or /usr/bin, they're the same directory on SunOS) earlier in
    your PATH than $OPENWINHOME/bin/xview, you'll get SunView programs instead
    of OpenWindows ones!

    Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that /usr/openwin/lib is last, after the X11
    library directory.	This doesn't matter with OpenWindows 3.0, but with
    older versions you'll get error messages from X11 programs if you don't
    do this.  The messages are generally harmless (see next item), although
    xdm core dumps if this isn't right.

    Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't
    /usr/openwin.

    See Also:
	Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).

@ I get error messages on my screen about ld.so: libX11.so.4 not found
    set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be /usr/openwin.  If you also use X11, use
	     /usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib
    If you put this in a shell script or your .profile, use
    ${OPENWINHOME-/usr/openwin}/lib instead of /usr/openwin; this is for
    /bin/sh; for csh it is different.

@ I launch my filemgr and I get ld.so:map heap error (9) at /dev/zero
    Your system needs to be patched.  Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches
    and install the patch.

@ Why doesn't AnswerBook run for me?
    You must be running OpenWindows to use AnswerBook.	It won't run under
    X11 (on an X terminal or on anything else) because it uses NeWS to draw
    the PostScript text and pictures.
    If you are using OpenWindows 3.0, you need to use the OpenWindows 3.0
    compatible navigator; it's called .navigator.ow3 on the AnswerBook CD/ROM.
    If all AnswerBook users are using OpenWindows 3.0, you can replace
    navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to
    satisfy your sense of paranoia!)
    The navigator.ow3 binary is also on CD/Ware Vol 2.
    Note that the data files are in PostScript, so you can look at them with
    a PostSript viewer (q.v.).

@ Why aren't there any fish in realxfishdb?
    A fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from
    ftp.eng.auburn.edu [131.204.10.91] as /pub/realxfishdb.Z

@ Why is the Properties choice disabled in the Window menu?
    It isn't implemented yet.  Many programs do respond to the Properties
    Key (L3), though, or have a pop-up menu with Properties on it.

@ File completion in the C-shell is broken in cmdtool
    Sadly true, but use shelltool or xterm instead and it's fine.  It also
    works if you run command tool on a remote machine.
    Fixed in OpenWindows 3.0.1 shipped with Solaris 2.

@ When I run OLIT programs, some of the widgets are red!
    Release 3 of OLIT added mouseless operation; action widgets can be
    selected via the keyboard.  The currently selected item is highlighted
    in red (the `Red Stain') to show that it has the input focus.
    To disable it in most places, add this to your $HOME/.Xdefaults file:
	*traversalOn: off
	*TextEdit.traversalOn: on
	*TextField.traversalOn: on
    You can change the color using (for example)
	*InputFocusColor: grey50
	*input*FocusColor: green
	*List*inputFocusColor: <your background color>
    See the man page resources(3w), at the start of the OLIT 3 Widget Set
    Reference Manual included in the OpenWindows 3 programmer documentation.
    Meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451-30, the
    OLIT/3.0 CTE Jumbo Patch.

@ When I run several programs, the colors on the screen all change when
  I move into a different window! (""colormap flashing"")
    
    This is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.
    However, you can minimise the effect with the following procedure:
    *  Start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.
    *  Run
	cmap_compact save
       to create the .owcolors file
    *  Put the line
	cmap_compact init
       near the start of your start-up file (.xinitrc)
    *  Exit and then restart the window system.
    *  cmap_compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of
	the colormap and reserves them.

    Also note that control-L2 locks the colors of the current window, and
    Control-L4 unlocks them -- this is described in the olwm manual page.

@ pageiew uses the wrong colors, or makes the colormap flash (see above):
    This problem was reported by people for some reason running the Motif
    window manager (mwm) with OpenWindows.
    Try running pageview like this:
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -svmono
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/pageview
	$OPENWINHOME/bin/reservecolors -discard

@ XDM breaks things
    Command tool doesn't like being run without a Unix `controlling terminal'.
    Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.
    SunView applications may need to be run with svenv, as in
	svenv -exec /usr/bin/traffic
    because xdm won't set the necessary environment variables.
    Note that the MIT xdm starts up the X server as root, which is a security
    hole for OpenWindows; use the OpenWindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your
    users can access files and start Unix processes ass root...

@ Function keys 11 and 12 stopped working
    In OpenWindows 3.0, the X11 names (""keysyms"") for these keys was changed
    to SunXK_F36 and SunXK_F37.	 Code which uses them should be recompiled,
    or you might be able to get away with
	xmodmap -e 'keysym SunXK_F36 = SunF36'

Subject: Trouble Shooting: XView problems
    This section is here only until an XView FAQ appears, which has been
    promised, but hasn't reached here.	Note that there is also a usenet
    newsgroup, alt.toolkits.xview, although it doesn't sem to have very
    wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles
    per month.	You should also look at the FAQ in comp.windows.x.

@ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?
    PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.
    PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.
    There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.
    You have to make sure that you always specify PANEL_LIST_FONT when you
    insert a new row into that list, or write a convenience function
    insert_row(list, row, string) that hides the nasty bits.

@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?
    In the button callback, do
        xv_set(button, PANEL_NOTIFY_STATUS, XV_ERROR, NULL);
    This will keep the window visible.
    You might also need to investigate the MENU_NOTIFY_STATUS attribute.

@ how do I make an XView button look pressed?
    call panel_begin_preview() and panel_cancel_preview(); these are
    documented in -- er -- the XView 3 source...

@ OpenWindows 3 imake doesn't work properly
    Here is Greg Earle's patch, to be applied in $OPENWINHOME; note that you
    should edit lib/config/sun.cf afterwards to get OSName and
    OSMinorVersion right (MinorVersion is 1 in SunOS 4.1.2, for example).
    I have edited the patch a little, so any bugs are mine [lee@sq.com] :-)

Subject: Environment Variables

    Environment variables, and plausible values to use -- this list doesn't
    take into account any local changes that you might have made, of course.
    This list is for OpenWindows 3.0 -- differences for OpenWindows 2.0 are
    marked, and I've added some comments for users of X11R4 and X11R5, too.

    DISPLAY  The name of the X Windows Display to use
	:0.0 (on the local machine, the one actually running X11 or xnews)
	:0.1 (on some machines for a second, monochrome screen)
	machine-running-unix:0.0 (on other machines)
	(You may need to do ""xhost +other-machine"" to let programs on other
	machines use your display; see also under Trouble Shooting, and see
	the section on xauth in the OpenWindows Version 3 Programmer's Guide,
	pp. 101ff)
	See also: console messages, under Trouble Shooting
    FONTPATH  Where xnews searches for fonts
	/usr/openwin/lib/fonts
	(you can also use ""xset fp+ dir"" to add a directory to the font path,
	but you may have to do ""xset fp rehash"" afterwards.  This is fine
	under OpenWindows, but many X11 servers have font problems)
    HELPPATH  Where XView looks when you press the Help key (or F1)
	/usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/openwin/lib/help
	(On SunOS 4.0.*, or with OpenWindows 2.0, omit the first entry, which
	is for sites using a local other than ""C"" or ""USA"").
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH   Where to look to find shared C libraries
	/usr/lib:/usr/5lib:/usr/openwin/lib:/usr/CC/`arch`
	(the /usr/CC/`arch`/lib entry is only needed if you use C++ programs)
    OPENWINHOME	 Where OpenWindows lives
	/usr/openwin  
    KEYBOARD, MOUSE -- serial devices to use instead of the console
	(don't set these for normal use; /dev/kbd and /dev/mouse)
    PATH  Where the Shell searches for programs to run
	$(OPENWINHOME)/bin:$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview:/usr/local/bin:.\
	$HOME/bin.`arch`:/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/hosts:\
	(you will certainly want to change this example!  There is no
	$(OPENWINHOME)/bin/xview in OpenWindows 3.0)
    XFILESEARCHPATH  Where programs look for app-defaults files
	/usr/openwin/lib/%T/%N%S
        (This is set automatically by ""openwin"" in OpenWindows 3.0)
        You might want to use /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S, or perhaps both,
        separated with a :, for example (for sh users)
            XFILESEARCHPATH=$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S:/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S
	    export XFILESEARCHPATH
	If you use X11R5, you might instead want
	    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%S:
	    /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%S:
	    $OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N%S
	(put all this on one line, though, with no spaces!)

	Together with the following in lib/Xinitrc
	xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB'
	   *customization:
	END_XRDB

	xrdb -merge <<'END_XRDB'
	#ifdef COLOR
	   *customization:  -color
	#endif
	END_XRDB

	you automatically get a color oclock, editres, bitmap, xcalc, and
	xlogo since they use the ""*customization"" resource appearing as %C in
	the XFILESEARCHPATH. (see oclock (n))
	according to Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>.


Subject: Where Can I get It? Ftp, implementations, etc...

    XView 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and
    elsewhere.

    MoOLIT can be bought from AT&T in source form.

    OpenWindows can be obtained from Sun, or you can get the source from
    Interactive Systems Inc.  It is also included in some vendors' System V
    Release 4 implementations, although that's not always the latest version.
    The current release of OpenWindows from Sun for supported architectures
    is 3.0; for the Sun 3 series it is frozen at OpenWindows 2.0.
    Note that Sun includes OpenWindows with SunOS, and it is also included as
    the windowing system for Solaris.

    There are said (by Sun) to be over 35 ports of OpenWindows either
    available now or in progress.  Unfortunately, none of them seem to
    be available from anywhere.  Contact anthony@ovi.com for more information.


Subject: Bibliography: books, manuals, journals, papers, beer-mats

    The OPEN LOOK (tm) Graphical Interface is documented in two books:
	Sun Microsystems Inc., `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Application
	Style Guidelines', Addison Wesley, 1989
    and
	Sun Microsystems Inc., `OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface Functional
	Specification', Addison Wesley

    The Main documentation for the X Window system comes from
    O'Reilly & Associates in about nine or ten volumes.
    The most useful for OPEN LOOK users are:
	Volume 1: XLib Programming Manual
	Volume 2: XLib Reference Manual
	Volume 3: X Window System User's Guide
	    (An OPEN LOOK edition of Volume 3 should appear later this year)
	Volume 7: XView Programmer's Manual [Dan Heller]
	    [make sure you get the 3rd edition for XView 3.0]
	Companion to Volume 7: XView Reference Manual [Ed. Thomas Van Raalte]

	The Companion to Volume 7 is an expanded version of the Attribute
	Summary from the previous edition of the XView Programming Manual,
	together with other reference information, so that in practice you
	have to buy both books.

	O'Reilly also have a thinnish orange book on the differences between
	X11R4 and RX115.

	OLIT programmers will also want the Xt books - volumes 4 and 5.
	There is a new big fat green Vol 5 updated for X11R5.

	A journal, The X Resource, may also be of interest.

    There's at least one book on using Solaris (i.e. SunOS).

    Sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with OpenWindows,
    although you may have to order it separately.  Here's what I have; they
    are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than A4 paper), and vary from
    about 1 cm to about 3cm thick.  They say `User's Guide' or `Programmer's
    Guide' on the front.  The User manuals have a red stripe on the bottom,
    and the Programmer ones have a green stripe.

    800-6093-10 ToolTalk 1.0 Programmer's Guide (SunSoft, 1991)
    There might be documentation about the Link Manager somewhere, too.

    AT&T includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with OLIT.

    Sun's AnswerBook CD/ROM contains a lot of the above documentation,
    including some of the O'Reilly books (not the XView 3 Volume 7, though).

    Volume 8 of the O'Reilly series is about X Administration, and mentions
    OpenWindows, although it is primarily aimed at X11R5.

    Several other books are in the works...

This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
X accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS
and Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.

That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say
you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could
put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could
have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any
combination.

Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different
in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.

The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,
this is 12.

As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.
X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X
I'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is
not the case.

We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Of
course, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""

This is probably cheating, and some window managers might STILL refuse to 
give it a border and all that other stuff, but it usually works.

Subject: XmTextField truncation with LANG bug(???)
Organization: Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN)
Lines: 42
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: spcsun18.bbn.com

I have found a situation which I think is a bug in X or Motif, but I'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part.  Does anyone know anything about
this problem........

- I am using an XmTextField, and setting its XmNvalue to a hardcoded
  text string (ascii or Kanji) either via XtSetValues or XmTextSetString.
  The problem is that when the XmTextField is displayed, the text is getting
  truncated, depending on the setting of the environment variables
  LANG (more specifically LC_ALL).  When they are set to japanese,
  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything
  works fine.  I am taking the default for XmNcolumns.
  (Please note that hardcoding of text is NOT done in my actual
   application, just in my sample code to make things easier)
	
- I am running Motif 1.2, X11R5 via HPUX9.01.  My test program is set up
  to handle 16 bit Kanji characters.  I have remembered to do   
  XtSetLanguageProc() prior to my MrmInitialize and my font resources
  are set to japanese fonts.

- Don't know if this matters, but my dialog box and TextField is initially
  created with UIL. 


The problem does NOT happen with XmText.  Unfortunately substituting
XmTextFields with XmTexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta!)

I have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it.  My best guess is that either the X code or Motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese, but since I don't have the
source to look at it is just a guess.

Please let me know if this sounds familiar, or if you have a suggestion,
or if you want the sample program.

THANKS!!!!!!!!

In SGI's distribution with their Indigo line (others as well, possibly),
they include source code for a GL widget that fits on top of Motif, and
one that's Xt based as well.  You may wish to ask IBM whether they
support this.

They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth
adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.

Summary: how to subscribe (and why)
Keywords: biz, sco, newsgroups, mailing lists
Lines: 123


              Evolution of SCO newsgroups and Mailing Lists
              ---------------------------------------------
   
   Many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful
   information on SCO Open Desktop since 1990 through the ancestral USENET
   newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it's companion mailing list.  Similarly,
   there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum
   for SCO products in general.
   
   With the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional SCO
   newsgroups, many current contributors including those who have been
   active in circulating SCO related newsgroups and mailing lists felt
   that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.*
   hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.

   biz.sco.{opendesktop,general,announce} were newgrouped May 1, 1991 in
   accordance with accepted procedure within ""biz"".  Given the content,
   this change relocated the ""opendesktop"" newsgroup to a more proper place
   within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new ""announce""
   and ""general"" groups.  On Aug 1, 1991, the former ""sco-list@uunet.uu.net""
   became ""scogen"" in keeping with established biz.sco.* naming conventions.

   biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on June 1, 1992
   to respectively accommodate SCO Xenix, UNIX and OpenDesktop specific
   binaries and source code.  The binaries and sources news groups are
   moderated, with moderator and submissions information and policy
   outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.
   Respecting USENET etiquite, these newsgroups are _not_ gated to
   mailing lists, but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.

   biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped Dec 14, 1992, to provide a discussion
   area for the readers, writers and publishers of SCO Magazine.
   
   Subject to the USENET NEWS hierarchies carried by your upstream feed,
   you are now able to subscribe to the following:
   
        Newsgroup                    mailing list subscription
        ---------                    -------------------------
        biz.sco.opendesktop          scoodt-request@xenitec.on.ca
        biz.sco.general              scogen-request@xenitec.on.ca
        biz.sco.announce             scoann-request@xenitec.on.ca
	biz.sco.sources			<none>
	biz.sco.binaries		<none>
	biz.sco.magazine	     scomag-request@xenitec.on.ca

   You are _strongly_ encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via USENET
   NEWS mechanisms vrs mail.  Anyone having difficulty arranging a news
   feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and
   I'll do my best to help.  We also offer all required software in
   source code form via anonymous FTP and UUCP, as do many archive sites.
   If, after having explored all options, you are still unable to receive
   biz.sco.* as news, you may subscribe to the mailing lists.
   
   The 4 discussion newsgroups are bi-directionally gated to companion
   mailing lists, so anyone not having access to NEWS but who does have a
   UUCP or Internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.
   Mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate
   ""mailing list subscription"" address above, including in the message body:

	Add: subscriber_address		-eg-
	Add: your_logname@site.do.main  -or-
	Add: up!stream!yoursite!your_logname

   Inclusion of an alternative working bang-path relative to a well know
   major functional site might prove beneficial.  Deletions are handled
   the same way, simply substitute ""Delete:"" for ""Add:"", ensuring that
   you use the exact same address you subscribed with.  Mailing list
   subscribers receive ""how to post to the mlist"" article submission
   information when their request is processed.  If you don't receive
   an acknowledgement within a few days, check your routing and try a test
   message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host.  In such cases, it's likely
   that someone, somewhere, is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do
   the same with mailing list traffic), and you'll want to resolve your
   connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again.  Mailing list
   subscriptions are free, subject to whatever arrangements you may have
   with the site(s) feeding you.
   
   Should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged
   drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists, this indicates that we
   are no longer able to find a working route to your site.  We loose a
   handful of subscribers this way each month.  If this happens to you,
   please email us your known working bang-path relative to a major site.

   What's in the newsgroups (and mailing_lists where applicable):
   
   biz.sco.opendesktop: Technical questions and answers and informative
                        postings relating to past, present, and future
                        implementations of the SCO OpenDeskTop operating
                        environment and it's various bundled components.
   
   biz.sco.general:     Questions, answers and comments on SCO products
                        in general, and of course resulting discussions.
   
   biz.sco.announce:    SCO and SCO Developer product announcements of
			interest to current and future users of SCO products,
			and to SCO developers, resellers and distributors.
                        (moderated, followups directed to biz.sco.general).

   biz.sco.sources:	SysV or BSD source code for useful programs and
			utilities, modified to compile and run with various
			incarnations of SCO Xenix, UNIX, and/or OpenDesktop.

   biz.sco.binaries:	Binary packages compiled from SCO compatible source
			code, often from source posted in biz.sco.sources
			and often installable using the SCO ""custom"" utility.

   biz.sco.magazine:	Interaction between the SCO Magazine readers, 
			writers and publishers.

   You should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable
   newsgroup.  For example, posting your ODT question to the ""general""
   newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being
   saved in the public ODT archives.  Appropriate crossposting is allowed.

   The undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco
   namespace.  Suggestions for additional biz.sco.* newsgroups and/or
   mailing lists should be emailed to the address below.

You are right but PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.  It makes my brain hurt.
USPosition and USSize should ONLY be set if the USER specified the
position and size.

You say: ""Tom, don't blow a gasket, what's the harm?""

Some window managers do very different things (besides positioning the window)
when they see USPosition rather than PPosition.

1) Don't call going from an Amiga to a IBM 'upgrade'
2) The Amiga Workbench did the job of a Desktop manager, and there is no
   really amazing good X Desktop manager in the Public Domain.
   (I'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)
3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
4) X associates icons with nothing. A number of X Window Managers associate
   icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.
   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application.
5) The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

Hello,

   When starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
""cannot load app-defaults file..."" check your XAPPLRESDIR
environment variable and then put the file BuilderXcessory 
( this is the app-defaults file for BX ) in the directory
specified by the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable.

   If you don't have an XUSERFILESEARCHPATH environment variable
then set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to be the directory where the
BuilderXcessory file is. You can do this using the setenv
command under csh. Note that the name ends in .ad so you will
have to set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to {BX}/%N.ad to get the
app-defaults to load correctly.

   To make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all
the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults
file exists in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or 
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is
set up.

   Once you have taken care of this set the *systemDirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed BX. 
For example let's say I've installed BX in /t then my system
directory resource should be set like this :

*systemDirectory: /t/builderXcessory

Subject: Looking for updated XView textedit source (w/d-n-d support)
Article-I.D.: armory.1ri2o2$3hm
Organization: CenterLine Software, Inc.
Lines: 28
NNTP-Posting-Host: 140.239.1.32

The XView version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
of X11R5 included the source to the textedit program.  I'd like to take 
the sources and modify them to add support for a ToolTalk-like message 
server, and maybe for ToolTalk while I'm at it, since the Sun-supplied
textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.

However, the sources in the R5 contrib area seem to be for an older
version of textedit than the version shipped with OpenWindows 3.  For
example, the OWN 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview
knows nothing about drag and drop.

The textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,
dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the OWN 3.0 binary says:

        textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro
        ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 Copyr 1990 Sun Micro

So, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?
I'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.

Please reply by email, and I'll post a summary if there's enough 
interest.

Subject:   1)! What books and articles on X are good for beginners?

	Ken Lee of SynOptics (klee@synoptics.com) regularly posts to 
comp.windows.x and ba.windows.x a bibliography containing cites of all known 
reference books and how-to manuals and also cites of selected technical 
articles on X and X programming; it is ftp-able as 
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xbibliography and 
	gatekeeper.dec.com:/pub/X11/contrib/Xbibliography

Here is an unordered set of the reference books and tutorials most useful for
beginners; most appear on that list [comments are gathered from a variety of 
places and are unattributable]:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   4)  What X-related public mailing lists are available?

	The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X
maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost 
identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup. 

	***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	***
	***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***

	Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information 
electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within
your company is already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to 
xpert-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu with a valid return electronic address. 

	The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from MIT), public reviews, adoption of 
standards by the MIT X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It does NOT 
carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you already 
receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert mailing 
list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.  Otherwise, to 
subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu. Note: Only 
redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no personal 
addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact your mail 
administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you on it.  
	comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.

	In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:
		bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions
		x-ada           X and ada
		x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics
		ximage          people interested in image processing and X
		xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X
	To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your 
organization already receives it, send mail to <list>-request@expo.lcs.mit.edu
with the Subject line including the name of the LIST in caps and the request
""addition request"".  In the body of the message be sure to give an address for 
your local distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

	A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg
Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to openlook-request@unify.com (or
openlook-request%unify@uunet.uu.net) for information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?

	When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without
all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are
able to respond at all.

	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it 
from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,
give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S 
version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to 
mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.

	Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what
you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the 
exact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote 
doesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary 
(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?

	The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)
are publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:

	- O'Reilly and Associates publishes ""The X Resource: A Practical 
Journal of the X Window System"" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).  
Editorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.

	- The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a 
variety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber 
Services, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial 
information: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?

	Xt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which 
provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An ""Xt-based"" 
program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses 
Intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.
	Xmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions
useful in building various applications and widgets.
	Xaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set
distributed with X11 source.
	Xm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary
kits are available from many hardware vendors.
	Xhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, 
but several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed
on the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.
	CLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.
	XDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for 
a display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.
	XLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard
logical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they
can query and access those resources.
	RTFM: Common expert-speak meaning ""please locate and consult the 
relevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual"".
	UTSL: A common expression meaning ""take advantage of the fact that you 
aren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke"".
	API: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in
a programming library.
	BDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled
X fonts.
	GUI: graphical user interface.
	UIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets 
programmers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple ""outline"" form
	WCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the 
understanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and 
actions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file
	GIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0
	UIMS: User Interface Management System

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)

	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the 
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It 
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with 
other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need 
to read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the 
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window 
manager.  Get it either:
	- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT
	- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys ""X Window System"" book
	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, ""X Protocol
Reference Manual."" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.
	The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to 
the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the 
presentation.

[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]

	- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's
""Programmer's Supplement for Release 5"". The complete document is on the R5
tapes.

	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in ""RTFM"" and is
the most-important of the least-read X documents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?

	The MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of 
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.
	MIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and 
administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the 
Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, 
Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).
	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, 
with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  
Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with 
others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification
is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium
as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public 
review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or 
Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.

Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK
was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was
developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF 
members. 

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; 
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.
Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the 
one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce 
programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's 
(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a ""virtual toolkit"" which provides objects in the
style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising 
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?

	Open Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system 
that combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface 
specification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).

[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?

	DECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI 
toolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a 
session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, 
dxpsview, etc.).

(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)
[8/90] 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  15)  What is PEX?

	PEX is the ""PHiGS Extension to X"".
	PHiGS stands for ""Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics 
System"" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation 
and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in 
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension 
allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized 
hardware for 3D graphics.
	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely 
redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample
implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.
Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for 
their workstations and X terminals.

[last modified 10/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  16)  What is ""low-bandwidth X"" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?

There are several options for using X over serial lines:

SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,
and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.
Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per 
packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully 
so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). 

CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the 
40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do 
anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,
but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed 
data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).

PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial 
line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for 
running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.

XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes 
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and 
using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a 
pseudo-X server or ""proxy"" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There 
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:
   (1)	You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't 
	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly 
	connected), and
   (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
	have to cross the serial interface, and
   (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering 
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for 
	blocks to compress.

LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using 
NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX
will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information 
(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, 
etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a 
Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample 
implementation available in R6.

Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how
LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu

Subject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?

	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the
X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is
no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways 
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order
(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):

	wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3
	uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, 
although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.
	twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window 
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager. 
	awm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
	cwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. 
	rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.
	dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering
	hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm
	mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit
	tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering 
	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style
Guide functionality
	olwm (AT&T): ditto
	gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in
Lisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]
	m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape
	pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release
	swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple
GUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file
	twm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape
	vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available
on archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available 
from export. [3/92]
	tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is
available on archive servers
	olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is 
available on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.
	mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version
is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a 
source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].
	NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look 
	XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals 
	ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.
Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
	vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.
	4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM
	piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?

	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your 
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X 
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your 
window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in
the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.
Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, 
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?

	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature --
which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the
geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something 
close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. 
Look for the application ""xplaces"" on an archive-server near you. There are 
several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.
[10/90]
	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the 
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running
applications and the resource database. 
[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?

	DEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, 
add to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:
	sm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?

	You can turn auto-repeat on or off by using ""xset r on|off"". The X
protocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide
command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over 
server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the 
server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server 
from MIT with the options ""-ar1 350 -ar2 30"" to reduce the sensitivity of the 
keyboard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?

	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful 
for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and 
does not do ""macro expansion.""
	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, 
accept a translation resource such as:
	xterm*VT100.Translations: #override \
		<Key>F1: string(""setenv DISPLAY unix:0"")
which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control
characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include.
	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor
has a special ""remapper"" client been made available.

Welcome to the Motif++ Mailing List!

The Motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to Motif++, the PD C++
wrapper library for Motif, where people can ask questions about Motif++, 
swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the 
bindings. 

All requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.
should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl

All e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so
please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to
messages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded 
from auto-replies.

Hello Motif World,

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the Motif++ bindings. Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have
been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.

This is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will
incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support
X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.

Note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this
distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.

Here is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:

HISTORY

The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,
has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++
classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through
member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only
worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.

I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell 
bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and
enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).

NEW RELEASE

I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++
bindings. 

This release offers:

- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support
- Support for Xbae widgetset 
- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate
  progress in an application.
- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to
		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable
		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely
		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you
		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma
		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude
		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.
- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted
  on Usenet.

WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS

Ftp:

Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.

Note:

Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large
files during working hours.

Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this
is an old version of the bindings.

E-mail:

Those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by
e-mail.

REQUEST

Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please
contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). 

MORE INFORMATION 

Contact me at ""rvloon@cv.ruu.nl"".
If you are desperate, then you can call me at
+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands
call 030-506711).

 <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (Rick Richardson)

rick> This is one area where Microsoft NT has a big advantage.  Since
rick> they control the whole show, there are no issues like this where
rick> licensees create incompatible defacto standards.

This happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it.  I remember when _SunView_ was hot stuff (and am not,
by that statement, endorsing Sun and its products, this is just my experience),
and when OpenWindows became hot stuff, that was when I started hearing, as
mentioned before, the ""socialistic masses"" that were bent on destroying 
_anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including OpenWindows.  I mentioned
Motif in the same breath, because that is what Sun has decided to turn its
attention to, not because I hate it.  Mr. Richardson's position, I believe, is
a healthy one, and I am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy NT, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be
free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are 
no de facto standards.

It was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.

internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  From the PC
file server, I pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
to a SGI Indigo (the SGI is not networked yet).  When I try to uncompress
and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or I get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.
What I'm wondering about is the transfer of UNIX files (compressed,

No.  Even if you could, the answer could be out of date even before you
get it (even if you grab the server, it could be taken up by buffering
user actions).  You should just try to do whatever you want; a BadAlloc
error is your indication that insufficient server memory is available.

The short answer seems to be: ""I don't"".
The particular package (wscrawl) seems to reset *all* its defaults
if *any* of them are missing from the .Xdefaults file.  Once I added
the missing ones to the .Xdefaults file, the problem goes away.

I have the March/April version of the X Journal open in front of me.

I'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since I don't have
much experience with programming X, I thought this issue might be helpful
as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
in programming X.

At the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
tutorials on X programming style.  They are:

Rosenthal, David -   A simple X11 client program
  Proceedings of the Winter 1988 Usenix Conference, 1988.

Lemke, D., and Rosenthal, D. -  Visualizing X11 clients
  Proceedings of the Winter 1989 Usenix Conference, 1989.


Does anyone know where I could find these in printed or (preferably)
electronic form?

Or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
programming X (I'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so I am really
only asking about what I can find on the net.)

This isn't of much help! Especially when doing Phigs (PEX) via the libphigs as
supplied by MIT, I have much trouble together with PEX-terminals that don't
have enough memory!

Performing the following:

   visual.visualid = CopyFromParent;

   bg_pix = WhitePixel( grafik_display, DefaultScreen( grafik_display ) );
   
   xswa.backing_store      = NotUseful;
   xswa.event_mask         = ExposureMask | StructureNotifyMask;
   xswa.background_pixel   = bg_pix;

   graphic_window =
         XCreateWindow( graphic_display,
                       RootWindow( graphic_display,
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       0,
                       0,
                       DisplayWidth(graphic_display, 
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       DisplayHeight(graphic_display, 
                                  DefaultScreen( graphic_display ) ),
                       (unsigned int)0,
                       8,
                       InputOutput,
                       &visual,
                       CWEventMask | CWBackingStore | CWBackPixel,
                       &xswa );
   XMapWindow( graphic_display, graphic_window );
   
   /** sync and wait for exposure event **/
   XSync( graphic_display, False );
   XWindowEvent( graphic_display, graphic_window, ExposureMask, &exposureEvent );

   conn.display     = graphic_display;
   conn.drawable_id = graphic_window;

   xinfo.display = graphic_display;
   xinfo.flags.no_monitor = 0;      /* False -> Monitor is running! */
   xinfo.flags.force_client_SS = 0; /* False! */

   popen_xphigs( NULL, 0, PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_NO_MON |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_FLAGS_CLIENT_SS |
                          PXPHIGS_INFO_DISPLAY, &xinfo );

   popen_ws( 1, (Pconnid)(&conn), phigs_ws_type_x_drawable );

I get core dumps in the popen_ws call! (No BadAlloc, etc.! Simply a core
dump!) So I need some way of getting info about the maximal available memory
to the Xserver!

But thanks!

Sincerly,
        Matthias

I have been building X11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time I had
trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so I
couldn't use gcc to build Sun shared libraries). The important thing to
do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. Gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.

Hi netland,

I thought that I once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.
On the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) I can't find
any trace of this program. Could anybody give me a hint where to find this
program or confirm/deny the existance of this program.

will this feature be based on the Kerberos authentication mechanism
(and, if so, will Kerberos Version 5 be used)? Please reply via email.

  If you need speed, and your client can run on the same host as the X server,
  you should use the shared memory extension to the sample X server (MIT-SHM).
  xdpyinfo  will tell you if your server has this extension. This is certainly
  available with the sample MIT X server running under SunOS.
  A word of warning: make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
  memory. And another word of warning: OpenWindows is slower than the MIT
  server.
  I have written an imaging tool (using XView for the GUI, by the way) which
  yields over 10 frames per second for 512*512*8 bit images, running on a Sparc
  IPC (half the cpu grunt of an IPX). This has proved quite sufficient for
  animations.

I believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the GC to be (foreground^background).

Subject: Overriding window manager focus processing
Organization: GE Information Services, Rockville, MD
Lines: 44
NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.edu
Keywords: Window Manager Focus Motif

     I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am 
using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future.

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window.  Let's say, for example, that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A.

      From the research and testing I've done so far, it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this 
case Motif.  I haven't found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events, but I can't find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch.

      The temporary solution I've currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice.

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* 
window manager) when I don't want the window order switch to 
actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this 
newsgroup.

Cheers....     Randall

From my own notes on this subject....

Methods to automatically passwd Authorization from one machine to another.
  This also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current
DISPLAY that is being used.

1/ Use rsh/rexec/on...  (the method in the xauth manual)
      Set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote
  machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.

         xauth extract - $DISPLAY | rsh other xauth merge -

  This method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. My vampire
  program also uses a variation, however I wrap it as part of the remote
  command sequence  (EG:  xauth add $auth)

     Included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do
  this job for you. These programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow
  you to pass a secified list of ENVIRONMENT variables which includes
  the `DISPLAY' and/or a copy of the authorization code required.

     The `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also
  pass environment variables, as well as the current directory.  You will
  however be required to store the Authority in such a variable for
  passing. Unless you are also have shared home directories.

    WARNING: Environment variables and command line arguments are visible
  in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. As such passing authorization
  information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.
  The recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from
  the view of other users.

2/ Wrap it as part of the TERM environment variable.
      This method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass
  the TERM environment variable to the remote host. It is then a matter of
  an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information
  from the TERM environment variable and set up things appropiatly.
    A version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does
  this. Basically you change the TERM environment variable before the
  actual call to rlogin is performed, to include your DISPLAY and your
  authorization.
    On the remote machine you then extract this information and return the
  TERM environment variable to normal BEFORE you use it for reseting or
  stty'ing your terminal.

  ---8<---
  script for launching rlogin:
    #!/bin/sh
    # ~/bin/rl   --- Rlogin with display:
    if [ -n ""$DISPLAY"" ]; then
      case ""$DISPLAY"" in
        :*) DISPLAY=`hostname`$DISPLAY ;;
      esac
      TERM=""$TERM&$DISPLAY&`xauth nextract - $DISPLAY`""
      export TERM
    fi
    rlogin $*
  ---8<---
  add to your .cshrc or .login
    if ( $?TERM ) then
      if ( `echo $TERM | tr -cd '&'` != '' ) then
        echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f3 | xauth nmerge -
        setenv DISPLAY `echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f2`
        setenv TERM    `echo ""$TERM"" | cut '-d&' -f1`
      endif
    endif
  ---8<---
  xterm command to use
    xterm -T hostname -e ~/bin/rl hostname
  ---8<---

3/ NFS.
     Write it to a file on a shared NFS partition you have access to.
   Note that if the home directories are NFS mounted, then authorization
   is automatically passed, Hoever you will still have to pass your
   DISPLAY environment variable via a file or other means. IE:

      login host:       echo $DISPLAY > ~/.X11host
      remote host:      setenv DISPLAY `cat ~/.X11host`

4/ Finger for the info in a .plan file
      This involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or
  `.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.
  This has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering
  the user.  Thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each
  individual.  IE: the method of decyrption must not be shared or known
  by others, nor should it be easy to determine.
    A improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give
  the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone
  who is asking.
    This last method was developed last year by a second year here, untill
  I explained to him the need for the encryption, at which point he gave
  up this method. It is however a valid method. It is easer than (2) but
  less secure.

For flexibility. Anyway, what you say is not really true. The color information
is associated with a GraphicsContext, not with a display, and the GC _IS_
a parameter to the drawing routines.

So, if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width 2, you can make 2 GCs for those cases and then simply do

XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_red,x1,y1,x2,y2);
XDrawLine(dpy,win,gc_blue,x3,y3,x4,y4);

for this effect.

This is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer, but also much
more efficient and flexible. You would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern, with, cap and joinstyle, drawmode and so on in every
drawing call, so why do it for color ? BTW, stay away from XDrawPoint()
if you don't really need it (to draw RANDOM points), for image transfers
there are Image routines.

Subject: X11R5 vs X11R4 Configure Event Handling
Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 31

REPOST:

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

I can think of two different methods that you could try. 1) use fork and 
execv 2) use the ""system"" called in your program.  I'm assuming that you're
running under the Unix OS of course.

Subject: Looking for X Window Server Frequency-of-Operations Data

Keywords: Frequency data X Server architecture

Hello--  I'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
X.  A friend and I are designing the chip as the final course project for
an advanced computer architecture course taught by Dr. Fred Brooks at
UNC-Chapel Hill.  While we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
X-Windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
budget.  

Unfortunately, I've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
various X FAQs, or X manuals that I've seen.  Does anyone have some type of
frequency data, like how many Copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and
things of that sort?  Or, barring that, a program that records requests to
the server into a logfile that I can munge on myself?

Any and all help would be very appreciated.

Many thanks,
    ---Mark

It applies with equal force to earlier versions.  Presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
The necessity it refers to has always been there, but it's been
implicit in the way CreateWindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.

This is because the warning you read is incomplete.  You have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is
CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't
match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a
border-pixel, and the problem should go away.

There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that
CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to
XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines
CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib
implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm
not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)

I don't know a great deal about the support for C++ in UIM/X, but I can tell 
you that there is good support for it in TeleUSE.  In TeleUSE you can call any
C++ method from a ""D"" module.  What you can do then is to use the ""D"" language
for most of your interface code and then use C++ for you application code.

I should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of TeleUSE soon
in regard to C++, but I can't give you many details.  You should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

If you want example code of how C++ integrates with TeleUSE you should look at
$TeleUSE/examples/Thermometer

He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely
correct.  Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout
which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks:

Xmp/Table.c:

void XmpTableNewProposedLayout( tw )
    XmpTableWidget tw;
{
    XmpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XmpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XmpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */

    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, Motif is broken so that we actually may already have
     * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout is already
     * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XmpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );
        XmpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );
    }
    /* else the resize has already been done.  Our proposed layout would
     * have been forgotten in the process.
     */
}

The XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names:

Xp/Table.c:

void XpTableNewProposedLayout(  tw )
    XpTableWidget  tw;
{
    XpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */
    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may
     * already have * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout
     * is already forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );
        XpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );

""return_place"" is probably incorrect.  It should be a pointer, not an
integer.  XGetWindowProperty() allocates memory, copies the data there,
and returns a pointer to the memory.  You should free the memory when
you're done.

Greetings!


We have several VXT 2000 Windowing terminals and associated software on our
network.  We are able to open a LAT terminal window to any of our workstation
nodes but we are unable to get a LAT X session to work.

We have customized the terminal security to allow all LAT connections.

Trying to invoke a LAT X session from the VXT 2000 results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area:

Host Does Not Support X Sessions

(The host is a VAX4000 Model 60 and does support X sessions)


Opening a LAT terminal window and logging into the server node, setting the
display variable as follows:

$ set display/create/node=LAT_###########/transport=lat

and then trying to create a decterm on the VXT as follows:

$ create/term=decterm/detach

Fails and gives the following error message:

dectermport failed to find language, XOpenDisplay("""")  returned NULL
%DECW-F-CANT-OPEN-DISPL Can't open display

The VXT 2000 is using its system defaults (ie. default font(s), language, ...)
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
LAT protocol.

we have VT1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
LAT X sessions.

VMS Version is 5.5-1
Running DECwindows/Motif of VAX4000 Model 60s


Please help.

You can't make GL calls in an XmDrawingArea widget for sure.

I can vouch for that. The GL Widget works pretty well. I have been using it
for sometime now. I'm not sure though whether you can use Xlib calls to draw
into the GL widget. I haven't tried it yet nor have I read the accompanying
documentation completely. Try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
Better still,you will find most of the answers in the  SGI manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the ""mixed-model programming""

Well, PEX is designed as an extension to  X and will be more seamless  but

Subject: Drawing Lines (inverse/xor)
Organization: MIT Media Laboratory
Lines: 40

I'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
boxes in Motif/X.  I'm running on an 8-bit display for which I've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which I'm displaying a bitmap using
XPutImage().  If doesn't matter if the lines I draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

Currently, to draw interactively, I begin with:

   /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */
   /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
   palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
   palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
   XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);
   XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);

Then to draw I do:

   XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
   XFlush( myDisplay);

And when I'm all done, to return things to normal I do:

   XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);


What I'd like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of
whatever I'm drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If
the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are
over a black area - nothing shows up!  It's very strange.  But the GXxor
function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

Any suggestions what I'm doing wrong?

Subject: painting with increasing resolution
Lines: 40

Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and
it seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and
can point me to some tools that would help. What they'd like to do is:
Given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the
data  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow
link), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the
picture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture
might first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of
pixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square
would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be
painted.

Since  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side
of a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn't be  transmitted
as  a bitmap; that wouldn't help at all.  Instead, there would have to
be a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a
small  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the
magnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X
server  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to
ask that a ""filter"" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the
only  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process
(""Permission denied"" ;-), and have it open a local window?

It seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up
such  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each
one by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.
But  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it's be nice
to hear about it.  (I looked in several FMs,  but  if  it's  there,  I
obviously  don't  know  the keywords ;-).  If someone has a nifty tool
available that packages it all, we might want to get a copy.

Oh, yes; this is to run on some Suns.  Part of the idea  is  to  build
demos  that  can  show such things as ""If this were run across, say, a
4800-bps link, this is how fast the pictures would appear.""  Then  the
customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.

Could someone PLEASE give a guess as to why this simple little program
causes a BadPixmap error on the FOURTH (bizarre???) call to XtRelaizeWidget()?

Here is the code:


int stoploop = 0;

static void Callback(Widget, XtPointer, XtPointer);

main()
{
        XtToolkitInitialize();
        XtAppContext app = XtCreateApplicationContext();
        while (1)
        {
                int junk = 0;
                Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(app, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0,
                                                &junk, NULL);

                Widget top = XtAppCreateShell(NULL, NULL,
                                applicationShellWidgetClass, dis, NULL, 0);

                Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""x"",
                                                        xmPushButtonWidgetClass,
                                                        top,
                                                        XmNheight, 25,
                                                        XmNwidth, 25, NULL);

                XtAddCallback(box, XmNactivateCallback, Callback, NULL);

                XtRealizeWidget(top);
                while (!stoploop)
                {
                        XEvent event;
                        XtAppNextEvent(app, &event);
                        XtDispatchEvent(&event);
                }
                stoploop = 0;
                XtReleaseGC(top, XDefaultGCOfScreen(XtScreen(top))); // needed?
                XtDestroyWidget(top);
                XtCloseDisplay(dis);
        }
}

static void Callback(Widget, XtPointer, XtPointer)
{
        stoploop = 1;
}


The error I get (yes, the 4TH time I try to show the box) is:

X Error of failed request:  BadPixmap (invalid Pixmap parameter)
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
  Resource id in failed request:  0xd0000d
  Serial number of failed request:  71
  Current serial number in output stream:  85


Please respond via email.  Thanks very, very much!

(NOTE: I realize this program does nothing useful, its an ultra-trivialized
version fo a real library routine)

Another company, Congruent Corporation of New York City, has also ported Xlib
Xt and Motif 1.1 over to MS Windows NT, which provides full client development
for X applications in an NT environment.

If you are porting InterViews over to MS Windows, I thought InterViews was
a C++ toolkit with C++ classes. If that is so, how can it be built on Xlib,
unless the classes are calling Xlib functions?

I want to do the equivalent of an ""xwininfo -name"" via a call or set of calls
in Xlib.  I need to map a windows name to its id.
It's probably easy, but I've only been programming in X for a little while.
I've looked in the O'reilly books and didn't find it and I also checked the

I don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
Keypress event.  Of course if there is some reason why you need to
always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the
keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root
window.  Then you get all the KeyPresses and you always know what have
been pressed.

I think this is just a question of how to implement XLookupString.
You can always write another function that interprets the KeyPresses
as you like.  You can look at the implementation of XLookupString from
the Xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.

Try this:

char *name=NULL;
unsigned long value;

if(XGetFontProperty(font, XA_FONT, value)) 
    name=XGetAtomName(dpy, value);

where dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer.

We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the
International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also
some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of
groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.

Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines
(See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines
for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are
in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry

Xhost:	Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested
X	Use tab indented lines if needed
X---remark---
X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if
X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a
X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th
X    column.  Blank lines are permitted.
X---author---
Xname:	your name
Xorg:	School/Company/Organization
Xaddr:	postal address
X	use tab indented lines to continue
X	don't forget to include the country
Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.
X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.
Xanon:	y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)
X---info---
XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in
Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info
Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.
X---build---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program
Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting
Xfile must be 255 bytes or less.
X---program---
XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode
Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.
X---end---
X
X      Regarding the above format:
X
X	* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*
X	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.
X
X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should
X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,
X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.
X
X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect
X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()
X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)
X
X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending
X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the
X	  ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same
X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be
X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.
X
X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above
X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges
X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate
X	  Email message to the judges.
X
X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless
X	  'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line.
X
X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for
X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and
X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.
X
X	* The entry's remarks should include:
X	    - what this program does
X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input)
X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any
X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)
X	    - information about any ---data--- files
X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated
X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.
X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)
X
X	* Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain
X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.
X
X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They
X	  should not be required to exist.
X
X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---
X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple
X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe
X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:
X
X	   'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed
X	   'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional
X	       digit, followed by '.c'
X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's
X	       title, possibly followed by a digit
X
X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your
X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a
X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of
X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed
X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'.
X
X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must
X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.
X
X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be
X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,
X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this
X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks.
X
X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.
X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not
X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the
X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.
X
X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.  (UTC is
X       essentially equivalent to Greenwich Mean Time)  Email your entries to:
X

XABOUT THIS FILE:
X
X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short).
X
X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about
X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
X
X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.
X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
X
X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      |
X
X
XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:
X
X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c
X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.
X
X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C
X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers
X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with
X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor
X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.
X
X
XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:
X
X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See
X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.
X
X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries
X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year
X    might be 'old' the next year.
X
X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply
X    a number of tests to an entry:
X
X	* look at the original source
X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines
X	* C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines
X	* run it through a C beautifier
X	* examine the algorithm
X	* lint it
X	* compile it
X	* execute it
X
X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.
X
X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain
X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the
X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as
X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given
X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that
X    does something interesting when you run it.
X
X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave
X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life
X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the
X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
X
X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know
X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse
X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the
X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to
X    annoy more than amuse.
X
X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries
X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use
X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)
X
X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make
X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly
X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some
X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work.
X
X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that
X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off
X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,
X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly
X    working entry is best.
X
X
XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:
X
X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We
X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests
X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far
X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
X
X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:
X
X	#define d define
X	#d foo		   <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo
X
X	int i;
X	j;		   <-- don't use such implicit type declaration
X	int k;
X
X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you
X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in
X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.
X
X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |
X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |
X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      |
X
X	int i;
X	char *c;
X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead
X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead
X
X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety
X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are
X    not portable and must not be used:
X
X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable
X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable
X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg
X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg
X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables
X	* using va_list as a structure or union
X
X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s.
X
X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.
X
X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),
X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some
X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not.
X
X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries
X    must not assume that it returns an int.
X
X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do
X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people
X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for
X    programs that are compact, and are instructional.
X
X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80
X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
X
X    We tend to dislike programs that:
X
X	* are very hardware specific
X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific
X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific
X	      code is likely not to be)
X	* dump core or have compiler warnings
X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
X	* won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x
X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit
X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs
X	* are longer than they need to be
X	* are similar to previous winners
X	* are identical to previous losers  :-)
X
X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the
X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program
X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
X
X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size
X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out,
X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to
X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel
X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off
X    if you show some amount of restraint.
X
X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact
X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get
X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
X
X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third
X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
X
X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating'
X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating
X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.
X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others)
X    know of a smaller one!
X
X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that
X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't
X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend
X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store.
X
X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and
X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client
X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the
X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).
X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone
X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not
X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or
X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better
X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.
X
X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on
X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines
X    in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    We like programs that:
X
X	* are as concise and small as they need to be
X	* do something at least quasi-interesting
X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)
X	* are portable
X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION
X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)
X
X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your
X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several
X    areas really does help.
X
X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in
X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to
X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
X
X    Be creative!
X
X
XENTRY FORMAT:
X
X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your
X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,
X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the
X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)
X
X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to
X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that
X    is found in mkentry.c:
X
X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every
X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,
X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the
X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the
X	contest rules before submitting an entry.
X
X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,
X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check
X    the entry against the size rules.
X
X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about
X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below)
X
X    The following is a sample entry:
X
X---entry---
Xrule:	1993
Xfix:	n
Xtitle:	chonglab
Xentry:	0
Xdate:	Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993
Xhost:	Un*x v6, pdp11/45
X	2.9BSD, pdp11/70
X---remark---
X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.
X
X    It is likely not to win a prize.  But what do you expect from
X    a short example!

X
X    Typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
X    and will compile into prog.  If an entry wins, we will rename
X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,
X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional
X    digit in case of name conflicts.
X
X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award,
X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
X
X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source
X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the
X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful
X    if you did one of the following:
X
X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
X
X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:
X
X		cc prog.c -o special_name		need special binary
X
X	    or  rm -f special_src.c			need special source
X		cp prog.c special_src.c
X		cc special_src.c -o special_name
X
X	    or  rm -f special_build			need special build
X		tail +4 build > special_build
X		sh < special_build
X
X	* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of
X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You
X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.
X
X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,
X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid
X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should
X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This
X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.
X
X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We
X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the
X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them
X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,
X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,
X    then skip the ---info--- section.
X
X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that
X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an
X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a
X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a
X    'hints' file.
X
X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For
X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed
X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,
X    the entry should not require them exist.
X
X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name
X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,
X    say so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they
X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say
X    so in the ---remark--- section.
X
X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has
X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should
X    have entry number 0.
X
X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry
X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the
X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't
X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the
X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:
X
X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for
X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries)
X
X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer
X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as
X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:
X
X	Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993
X
X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The
X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many
X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string:
X
X	date -u ""+%a %h %d %T 19%y""
X	date -u | sed -e 's/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/'
X	sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X	sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e ""s/... \(19[0-9][0-9]\)$/\1/""'
X
X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set
X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be
X    replaced.
X
X
XJUDGING PROCESS:
X
X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.
X
X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message
X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:
X
X	---entry--- section
X	all ---author--- sections
X	all ---info--- sections
X	---build--- section
X	---program--- section
X	any other text, including the Email message headers
X
X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the
X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is
X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.
X
X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding
X    out in the end, who won and where they were from.
X
X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.
X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all
X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning
X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even
X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,
X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC
X    winners at talks)
X
X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the
X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give
X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We
X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.
X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
X
X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,
X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;
X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the
X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.
X
X    A reading consists of a number of actions:
X
X	* reading the ---entry--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section
X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any
X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source
X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor
X	    shipping over any #include files
X
X    In later rounds, other actions are performed:
X
X	* linting the source
X	* compiling/building the source
X	* running the program
X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary
X
X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries
X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it
X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form
X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
X    An entry often will compete in several categories.
X
X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
X    we receive.  A typical category list might be:
X
X	* best small one line program
X	* best small program
X	* strangest/most creative source layout
X	* most useful obfuscated program
X	* best game that is obfuscated
X	* most creatively obfuscated program
X	* most deceptive C code
X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)
X	* best abuse of ANSI C
X	* worst abuse of the rules
X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>
X
X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so
X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.
X
X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into
X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
X    less clear cut.
X
X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out
X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is
X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry
X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,
X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!
X
X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a
X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest
X    rules in some way.
X
X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such
X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the
X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
X
X
XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:
X
X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,
X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to
X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.
X
X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:
X
X	    comp.lang.c		  comp.unix.wizards	alt.sources
X
X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following
X
X	    comp.sources.d	  alt.sources.d		misc.misc
X	    comp.sources.misc	  comp.windows.x
X
X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See
X    below for details.
X
X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners
X    have appeared in books (""The New Hackers Dictionary"") and on T-Shirts.
X
X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-)

Well I can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year.  The link I want to use 
though (ISDN 64K) is costly and the bandwidth limited.  That's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it.

Hmmm.  Has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all?  Are you
running any standard MS-Windows programs like Word ?  What sort of 
packets go blazing through? What size link do you have (2Mb or 10Mb ?).
What is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points?

What do you mean by network things?  I vision using MS Windows and other
Windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all I am getting are the displays.  I am wondering how 
good is the X and subsequently DV/X protocol in transferring these 
images with X-calls and displaying them on a client's machine.

Trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu

I cannot get the menus to come up without using a MenuButton

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

xdm does XGrabServer when it's running in secure mode (so do some
screen-locks).  There's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

You can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.

You can wrap your call to XOpenDisplay in some code which solicts
a future SIGALRM and longjmps past the XOpenDisplay from the signal
handler.  An example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

Note that longjmping out of XOpenDisplay probably causes a memory
leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
regularly.

[posted for a friend]

Okay, I looked through the FAQs and didn't see this, but I know its
come up before...

XAllocColor is supposed to do the following in order:
    Try to find an exact match read-only color cell. (within hardware limits)
    Try to allocate a read-only colorcell and set it to match.
	and when all else fails, 
    Return the colorcell with the best match from the read-only colors 
    already allocated in the colormap.

This sounds good in theory.  It doesn't seem to work this way
though.  If there is no exact match already in the colormap, and 
no unallocated cells, then XAllocColor fails, even when it has 
already allocated several other cells already, and there are dozens 
of read-only cells already in the colormap.

Is this a bug?  A feature?  A misunderstanding on my part?

Any help appreciated,

1) This is NOT a feature of the Window Manager but of xterm.
2) This sequences are NOT ANSI compatible, are they ?
   Does anyone know IF there are compatible sequences for this and what they
   are ? I would think they are DCS (device control sequence) introduced,
   but may be a CSI sequence exists, too ?
   This MUST work on a dxterm (VT and ANSI compatible), it may not work
   on xterms.

[Apologies if I'm answering something already answered in the FAQ.
Our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so I haven't
seen the FAQ lately to check.]


Two ways:
 
 1) When you start the xterm, you can use command line options:
         -n ICON_NAME           To set the icon label
         -T WINDOW_TITLE        To set the window title
         -title WINDOW_TITLE    Equivalent to -T WINDOW_TITLE

 2) You can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:

    The basic escape sequence is:
	ESC ] <P> ; <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> BEL

    where ESC and BEL are the ASCII ESCAPE and BELL characters,
    <P> is an ASCII decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending
    on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,
    or both, and <SOME_ARBITARY_TEXT> is your desired label string.

    Hence, this command will set the window & icon title:
         echo ""\033]0;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the icon title:
         echo ""\033]1;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    To set just the window title:
         echo ""\033]2;YOUR_TITLE_GOES_HERE\007\c"" 

    Of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,
    depending on how the echo command works on your system
    and what shell you are using (I've shown System-V semantics
    under Bourne or Korn shells).

    [Hint for Sun OS users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of
    /bin/echo or Csh's built-in echo.  Otherwise you'll have
    to embed literal ESC and BEL characters in the string
    instead of using convenient octal sequences.]

    If you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show
    your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll
    have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
    the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
    Sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
    in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...

I am having problems with a  Motif application that when run on another machine
(with different X paths, etc) can't find the XKeysymDB file.   This causes a large
warning output:

Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfActivate

etc.

as the file is in a different location, but Xt seems to only look for it in
the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on.  Is there any
way to read the XKeysymDB manually with an X/Xt call so that additions to
the XKeysymDB can be distributed with the application ?  I have used trace(1)
to find out what was going on, but I need a fix so that these translations in
the application can be recognised.

I've written an application for SparcStation 2 GX+, under OpenWindows 3.0.

The application uses XView stuff to create my window, and the SUN XGL
graphics library for rendering into the Canvas.

The application does real-time 2-D animation, but it does not update the
the display fast enough.
I'm using notify_set_itimer (XView call) to periodically kick off my
update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. I want it to
update 25 times / second. It's only doing about 11. Also, it appears to
be compute bound, because if I run anything else while my appplication is
up, the update rate slows down even more.

Any ideas ?
Thanks.

No. This is only relevant for OpenWindows 3.x as shipped with SunOS.
It is not relevant for MIT R5. MIT R5 should compile without problems.

     I recently found an excellent source for X-windows programs. I've seen
quite a few x-windows toolkits up there. The place is:  

                     export.lcs.mit.edu

go to the contrib directory. Its full of x-windows programs.

After looking at the scaling code I realized the follwing:

  1) My problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 
     problem.

  2) That the X server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
     to meet your requirements.  

     This means that if you server return a response like the following

     -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1

     You can ask for the follwogin:

        -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1
 
     and it will generate it for you.  You should try to always use 
     known pixel sizes.

Just create the window in the place you want it and set the program
position field in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property, then map it.

Then, assuming they have a non brain dead window manager, the user can
say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. For
tvtwm the UsePPosition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this.

Now, I'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news
timewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in
the WM_NORMAL_HINTS. _Do_not_ do this. It's evil. It's a disservice to
your users. Offler the tusked crocodile god will come in the night and

Hi folks,

I'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a SS1+ running SunOS 4.1.1 and OW 2.0,
and I'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  Specifically, make bombs
when it needs to use any Xaw file.  This isn't surprising since X11 files
on Suns with the standard OW 2.0 distribution are in various places under
/usr/openwin (Xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/X11/Xaw !!)
Actually, the real problem is that I know squat about imake, and I don't
know how to tell imake where the X11 files are.  I can see from the 
Makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the 
Makefile reads 

   # Makefile generated by imake - do not edit!

Help!  Is there some way I can edit the Imakefile to tell it where to
look?  (I have set DEFINES = -DOPENWIN_BUG, as it said to in the README
file.)

Email and post are both fine.

Thanks in advance,

Dave

Organization: National Center for Atmospheric Research
Lines: 18

Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the
server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X
servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing
to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -
a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a
Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior on
NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs. 
Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root
winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this
behavior correct? I'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor!

What it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
beginning X users (heck, experienced X users too!) write small test
programs.  Many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  We're just trying to
eliminate all the ""easy"" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
graphics. 

That being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  Try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
to see it you get any output.  Since you're dipslaying only a single 
plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

Alright.  Ignore this.  I have delved a bit deeper (XKeyEvent) and
found what I was looking for.

ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (LockMask is the one
for CapsLock).  Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies
from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask).
eg, SGI's vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris
1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an
unambiguous means of determining NumLock's mask at runtime for any
given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.

Hello,

	I am admin for an RS/6000 running AIX 3.2, X11R5, Motif, and xdt3.
	I want to prevent the user from hitting CNTL-ALT-BKSPC to exit X.
	
	I've tried invoking X with 'xinit -T', but that doesn't work.
	xinit appends the -T to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the
	call to X.  

	The man page to xinit is no help.  In fact, it tells
	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  

	So far, the only way I've been able to accomplish this feat is
	to add the -T to the call to X in /usr/lpp/X11/defaults/xserverrc.
	I would rather not do it this way.  Does anyone have any other ideas?

Hi there netters,

I require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
screen (root window). Could some windows guru out there help me on how to
go about doing this. I write the whole program which creates the window with
the image it displays - I require the image to appear at the top-left corner
so that I can grab it for recording on to video, using a MIniVas controller,
which expects the window at the same spot every time.

Thanks in advance.

Organization: Association of NeXTSTEP Developers International
Lines: 28

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
                /**/#This is a makefile
        at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
        preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
        I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
        line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
        start of a directive. 

        However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
        as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
        that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
        imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
        fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
        use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
        gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to
'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

Many spreadsheets do regression analysis.  The topic is also well covered
in most undergraduate statistic books.  Cubic Splines are usually well
covered in any undergraduate computer science numerical analysis text.
I am sure ge/mm has a well stocked library.

I have never used mathematica, but I would be surprised if it could not do a

OW 3.0 is the same.  But, the definition of broken is relative.  Pageview

I suspect this is because VUE creates a window (probably OverrideRedirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the Root Window. Because the window
manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because VUE's window is overlaid on top of the root
window. 

Contact HP support and see whether VUE can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.

Dear Folks:

It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, 
Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.

Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library
that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects.

Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes (though several configuration
files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). 
 
Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN
workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.

Xavier has been tested in the following environments:

Subject: String to Widget Resource Converter
Organization: Computer Science, Liverpool University

Can anybody tell me how to use the Xmu function ""XmuCvtStringToWidget"". I
want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that I can connect
two widgets together on an XmForm. ie.

MyProggy*MyListSW.topWidget:               MainTextSW

However, when I run the program, I get the message:

Warning: No type converter registered for 'String' to 'Window' conversion.

(Just like the manual sez).

I have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
to go about this:

    static XtConvertArgRec parentCvtArgs[] = {
        {
            XtWidgetBaseOffset,
            (XtPointer)XtOffsetOf( CoreRec, core.parent ),
            sizeof(CoreWidget)
        }
    };

    XtSetTypeConverter( XtRString, XtRWidget, XmuCvtStringToWidget,
                            parentCvtArgs, XtNumber(parentCvtArgs), XtCacheAll,                                NULL );


However, I haven't got a clue where to put it! The example code I have seems
to suggest I can only do this if I am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
says that I can add it to a widget's ""class_intialize"" function. HOW? What's
one of those? :-(

If anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - I'm sure
this is a FAQ.

Thanks in advance,

Rik.

PS: What are the header files ""CoreP.h"" and ""IntrinsicsP.h"" - should I use
    these or ""Core.h"" and ""Intrinsics.h"" (OK I know RTFM:-)

Subject: X Server scanline padding question
Nntp-Posting-Host: bach.coda.cs.cmu.edu
Organization: School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon
Lines: 42


I am *almost* done porting XFree86 1.2 to a new piece of display
hardware, but have run into a snag I think may be somewhat
commonplace, so I'm sending a net-feeler.

I have a display that is a non-interlaced, memory mapped, 1-bit
720x280 display.  The server's view of the world, (obtained via xwd |
xwud), seems to be exactly what it should be.  However, the displayed
version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is
using scanlines that are too long.  After a bit of experimentation, it
seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to
a word boundry, but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes, which
isn't exactly divisible by four.  Changing the following defines in
mit/server/include/servermd.h:

----

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  32
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		5
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

to:

---

#define BITMAP_SCANLINE_PAD  16
#define LOG2_BITMAP_PAD		4
#define LOG2_BYTES_PER_SCANLINE_PAD	2

---

Was not exactly the right solution.  How do I tell the server either
(a) don't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being
built to run on this particular display), or to pad only to byte
boundries?

I'm using a customized version of XFree86v1.2, under Mach 3.0.

Thanks

Hi! I've just installed the new XArchie 2.0.1 and it all works
fine, except:

on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
program don't work at all, but on the BW terminal it works fine.
I can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
give the neat-o change when busy action. (Other programs with
similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)

The X-interface author, George Ferguson, suggests it might be a
problem with the X intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around
to fix it himself. But I know zero about X programming, so I
don't think I can find it. 

Does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue
its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:

1) Use ""twm"" or ""mwm"" rather than ""olwm""
2) Use ""olwm"", with resource ""*wmTimeout: 10""
3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.

Subject: Efficient PC Clients

We're looking at various X11 clients for PC's and we're looking for some
information about the relative efficiency of different products.  Are any
notably efficient (fast)?  Are any notably inefficient?  I assume that a
Graphics Accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now I'm looking
at ico running on Xoftware/32 for Windows sitting on the Distinct TCP/IP
platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the
Sparc10's console.  What are the key ways of improving performance for
PC (presumably Windows) clients?

Also, what about async solutions?  (Yes, I appreciate that it will be 
*much* slower even with V.42bis.)  I'm in the process of installing PPP
(with header compression).  How does that compare to cslip?  I've seen
a product called XRemote by NCD that promises to be pretty efficient, but
are there comparable products out there?  If we're looking for efficiency
for async, PC clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard
PPP w/ compression and XRemote?

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I'm still taking in all
the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency
of various product offerings would be great.  (I get the impression
that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but
that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  Thanks.

You don't give the precise error message, but I assume that
the making of the target fails, because make can't find the rules.

We've seen this happen with SunOS 5.x make as well and aat this
point I'm not sure why it happens. It seems to happen
with large Makefiles. The entries near the end get lost.
Small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem,
as it does in your example.

In the MIT R5 distribution + R5.SunOS5.patch this can happen with
the target ``Makefiles'' in one of the doc directories.

This is really weird. Are your *really* sure that you were using GNU make?

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit
TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:

	1) Clients written with logic like the following:

	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)
		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */

	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
	   to run correctly.

	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just
	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a
	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but
	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.

Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many
clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a
default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing.

Has anybody actually seen the Tek color space stuff working?  I'm not
having any luck with either the xtici editor from export.lcs.mit.edu or with
O'Reilly's ftp-able example xcms from ftp.uu.net.

The O'Reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because
XcmsTekHVCQueryMaxV returns a smaller value than XcmsTekHVCQueryMinV does
(which makes no sense to me).

The xtici editor fails in XcmsStoreColors, apparently because the
mathematical manipulations of the color specs results in invalid values.  So
you can't actually edit any colors.

We have X11 R5 patch level 22; 8-bit pseudoColor visual.  I've poked around 
in the xcms code in Xlib, but without some understanding of the theory I have 
no idea what's going wrong.  Can somebody confirm if either of the 
above-mentioned programs work on their systems, or let me know if they fail 
for you too?  Please include what hardware/software/patch levels you have.

Any hints?

Hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. Jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,
call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations. Since both Jordan and I haven't encountered a 
OS flavor yet, that is fully POSIX, we haven't gotten around to
really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically
for just posix. The posix routines are used in the sun specific file
tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. All in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. The type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources. Even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the 
""drivers"" actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
compiled into emu.

It shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully
relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately I don't have a linux
system available to me, so I can't do the port myself. I would suggest
you read the README in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or
questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. Unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we 
just don't have access to that many different systems.

Take a look at TeleUSE, a complete UIMS from Alsys (formerly TeleSoft).
In the US, you can reach them at (619) 457 2700.

Alsys have an VMS version of TeleUSE v2.0.5 for VMS V5.5 or higher,
built using DECwindows Motif 1.0 (based on X11R4 and Motif v1.1.1).

BTW, the VMS port from the UNIX version was made at my company, and was
released in November 1992.

Subject: Some rookie questions

Im new to Xlib programming. Im having a problem I hope someone here can
help me with. I create a window, and I want it to have some background color,
say red, and draw an oval in it. Further, when I resize the window, I want
to be able to redraw the image so that is fills the new window (whether it
is larger or smaller.) Im using AIXwindows on an RS6000.

My problem is this: when I resize the window, only the ""original"" part of the
window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. Everything else
is a grey..the oval ""tries"" to redraw itself but gets clipped. I can see that
it WOULD be the right size if I could see all of it, but it only shows up in
the region that was the original size of the window when created.

For example, I start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. If I
resize it to 400x400, the only part that has any color drawn into it is
is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. Further the oval
only shows up in that 200x200 area.

What am I doing wrong?? How can I get a window to resize and redraw a 
re-scaled image in it to take up the full size of the window?

Second question:
Could someone tell me what Xaw and Xmu are???

Thanks,
Chris

If you already own all the ""clone"" equipment then there are lots of such
programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine).

*BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone.
(From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better.
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that
they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card,
very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP
for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole
lot of $$$$).

I can get 15"" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance
is over 80000 Xstones.....

Thanks to those who responded.

We were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods:

1) running twm rather than olwm
2) keeping olwm, but putting ""wmTimeout: 10"" in the resources

It has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
window manager positioning the popup window. Any guru who can analyse

Are there any graphics texts with examples/demos/projects directly in

The last time I taught the course, I used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package, with implementations available for
X/Mac/PC.  The problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package, but frustrated that they
couldn't really use their skill for other work.

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However,
after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not
happen when I use xscreensaver. 

My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:

xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &

My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects
a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.
However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is
there a workaround?

I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

Thanks.

Hi,

  I am trying to write an X-windows based interface that runs on top of GDB. Could 
anyone help me in understanding the way we are supposed to ""fork"" GDB off as a 
subprocess ?? I currently use pipes but when I try and debug this program, the 
following happens :

PROGRAM :

	main()
	{
           int x;
 

	   printf(""enter x : "");
           scanf(""%d"", &x);
           printf(""x = .%d.\n"", x );

        }

OUTPUT :

	The program hangs without returning the output of the printf statement. When I type
in a value (like 5), then all the printf's output comes out at one time.


Is there any other way, besides using PIPES to do this i.e., like ioctl or something else ??

Thanks,

Deepak

Hi folks

Say, I'm new to R5 and have one quick question.

In using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , I notice that it
always comes up with a very small window .  I'm pretty
sure its the default font.  My xterms all work normally.
Is xon supposed to read your .Xresources for a font size ?

xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.

I can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc
and everything is correct.  Of course you could always do a 
simple script to do this , but I have a feeling I'm missing
something simple here.

Comments / suggestions appreciated.

Thanks in advance

The version I have is using the x256q code instead of the default X Windows

it requires xstdcmap -best be run before it will work, annoyning but not a

I've been using the XmGraph widget that's been floating around and I
noticed the performance is significantly better using Gadgets, perhaps
even 100% faster.  I had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well
to use widgets everywhere.  So why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  Should I start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus? 

XmGraph manages children connected by XmArc widgets in a directed network
type graph with automatic layout capability.

Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence ""ESC [ 1 B 7"" 
would indicate that the ""HOME"" key was pressed, with the shift key
down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such
as ""shift-Return"".

If anybody wants these changes, they're welcome to them, but you'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file ""x11term.c"".  Maybe if someone at OSF is 
interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine they've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about 
emacs V19!).  If there's sufficient interest, I'll post the mods 
somewhere, although this probably isn't the appropriate group for it.

Notes: 

 * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create
   its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which 
   includes Xterm windows) then it's business as usual.

 * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2
   [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].  The patches are
   in a chunk of code between '#if sun ... #endif' but could 
   easily be adapted for anything else.

I am looking for a package that implements standard
image processing functions (reading/writing from
standard formats), clipping, zoom, etc. implemented
under X. Both public domain and private packages
are of interest. The particular application area I
have in mind is medical imaging, but a package meant
for a more general context would be acceptable.

Please reply to me; I will summarize on the net if
there is general interest.

This problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows, a misfeature of the X protocol, and a bug in the Xt intrinsics.  

The Intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x,y) position given in
ReparentNotify events.  Olwm is structured in such a way that, when a window
is popped down, the last event the client receives is a ReparentNotify event. 
At this point, the Intrinsics' notion of the shell's location is out of date.

If a SetValues is done using the same (x,y) position, the Intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell, so it issues a ConfigureWindow request to move it
there.  However, a (mis)feature of the X protocol is that a ConfigureWindow
request that has no effect will generate no ConfigureNotify event.  The
Intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive, and times out after
wmTimeout has expired.  (Actually, things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager, but the net result is the
same.)

The solution is for the Intrinsics to note the (x,y) positioning information
in ReparentNotify events.  This has been implemented and is available in X11R5
public fix 20.  This is XBUG 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

I have a peculiar color problem with MacX, Apple's Macintosh X server.
I'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. It's happened
with the current version (1.2), and with version 1.1.7.
When some types of client windows are displayed, parts of the windows
are in the wrong color; if the window is moved slightly, forcing the server
to repaint it, it is repainted in the correct colors. It doesn't happen
for xterm windows, but has happened for graphic windows and with some
Motif clients.

IMHO this whole discussion named ""Motif looks like MS-Windogs"" is totally
stupid. The only thing remotely influenced here can be the Motif Window
Manager, that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the MS-W windowmanaging agent, however its name is.
But MWM is only a SMALL part of Motif, in fact, MWM and Motif can work
without each other, and if one doesn't like MWMs outfit for some reason,
he switches to another windowmanager. All this doesn't influence Motif,
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications, and this toolkit
is IMHO uncomparable to MS-W, because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the MS-W interface.

You cannot say ""A Porsche looks like a VW Käfer"" ONLY because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position. Motif and MS-W are complete
different worlds, only one element of the Motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as MS-W.

We have recently purchased a Tektronix xterminal, and I'm having

display waveforms, and it doesn't work on the xterminal. the buttons,
etc, all show up, and it seems to take the 'right' amount of time to
draw, but nothing is visible in the graphics window. I
have no clue as to where to start looking: the program works fine
on all our suns (3s and 4s, color and B&W). could anyone suggest a
line of attack for this problem?

TekXpress XP380 color xterminal running 6.0.0. host is a Sun IPX
running SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R5, PL17.

I need some advice regarding monitor to use with Xfree86. I have an ET4000

Xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his PC. His monitor is
17"" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. I cant afford this kind
of expensive monitor. I heard from somewhere that Xfree86 requires multisync
monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60KHz. Is this true?
I would only like to use Xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and
so was thinking of buying a cheap 14"" SVGA monitor. Interlaced (Cheap)14"" SVGA 
monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38KHz.
Will this kind of monitor work with Xfree86? 

Please reply by email.

Thaks in advance.

  QUESTION:
  What is the EXACT entry (parameter and syntax please), in the X-Terminal
configuration file (loaded when the X-Terminal boots), to add another system 
to the TCP/IP access control list?   

  BACKGROUND:
  I have two unix systems, 1. an AT&T 3B2 running X11R3 and MIT's X11R4 and 
2. a Sun SS10 without any X.  
  I want to have a window to the Sun and the 3B2 on the NCD X-Terminal at the
same time.  I can do this if I manually set the Network Parameter TCP/IP
Access Control List to off, then login to my telnet session. Not Great!  
  I've tried to get ""xhost"" to work and failed.  Either my syntax is wrong
or the X11R3 implementation is bogus.  
  I am trying to edit the NCD configuration file that is loaded when the 
NCD boots.  No matter what entry I add or edit, the NCD still boots with
the TCP/IP Access Control list containing only the 3B2.
  My manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated!!  Thanks!

The oclock widget was written using the SHAPE extension.
You can do the same in your widgets.  Few current widgets
support SHAPE, so you'll have to subclass them to add that
functionality.

Subject: How do I cause a timeout?
Summary: how can I force a strip chart to update
Nntp-Posting-Host: ucsu.colorado.edu

I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling it's
get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am
not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).

Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will
call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around
this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I don't think)
call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I don't have the value for
the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).  

In other words, I want to force a strip chart widget to update itself.

Any ideas anyone?

It's actually a bug in the Solaris 2.1 kernel. We could add a workaround to
xterm. open should never return EINVAL, but it does :-(

I didn't have time to update the R5.SunOS5 patch lately, but non
of the existing problems seem to warrant a new set of patches.

XDM coulda also keep the XDM environment variable. It should have inherited
it from the environment.

Hi,

I'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering
to an X display and then playing it back again.  Rather than 
""reinvent the wheel"", it like to find:
	* a file format for saving X protocol.
	* software that saves and replays such a session.

Any ideas out there?  I've heard that there is a version of Xscope
that will save and replay sessions.

I'd be willing to share much of the code I develop back to the X community.

Summary: Slider Position of a List Widget's Vertical Scrollbar
Organization: USC  Department of Computer Science
Distribution: comp
Lines: 10

I need help positioning the slider of a List widget's horizontal scrollbar.  I am displaying the full
path of a selected file in a list widget.  The horizontal's slider defaults to the left side of the
list widget; however, I need the slider on the right side.  This is so the user can SEE the file name
they selected.  I know it's possible, because when files are displayed in a file selection dialog box,
the slider is on the right side.

Thanking any and all who can help in advance,
Rodney F. Clay

I am looking for software to draw a graph.  I want to just give it a list
of nodes and edges between the nodes and have the program come up with some
reasonable positioning of it.  

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Remapping <return> key in a dialog

I am new to X programming, so please bear with me....

I am trying to have a dialog box that returns it's value upon the
user entering a new value and hitting the <return> key. (don't want
to have a ""done"" button).  The piece of code below will work if
I exclude the XtNvalue argument but will not work as is. Can someone
shed some light on this or suggest a better way?  Ultimately I will
have several areas active at the same time to allow a user to modify
parameters in the program.

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone knew of an interface to od ( octal dump ), I assume
it would be called xod.  Actually, any viewer for a core file will do.

I looked at export ( @ mit ) in the index of /contrib, but didn't find anything

Subject: Overriding Default Behaviour

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]

Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I've tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

I'm just guessing here, but I'd guess that X11R5 expects the CG3 to have
1152x900 resolution, and the version of the CG3 in the SPARCclassic is 
1024x768.

I'm writing 'xwall', a simple X version of 'wall', and I want it to
put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  The problem
is that XOpenDisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently
controlled by xdm (login screen).   I've been through the manuals
and FAQ and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'
ahead of time, or to get XOpenDisplay to fail after a short period
of time.  Any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  Thanks...

Subject: HELP! Setting Colormaps on multi-top-level APP
Keywords: GLX mixed-model,colormap
Organization: DSG, Stanford University, CA 94305, USA
Lines: 71


Dear SGI and netter GL-X Mixed-Model experts,
I am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows, and I've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests.  In some environments
(entry level R3000 Indigo w/ 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps, but on others (an IRIS 4D 240/GTX;
also a different entry level Indigo) the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when I compile at different times.  The most common
problem is that all non-top-level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap.  My application starts out by creating three top-level
windows; in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap.  This is spectacularly aggravating.

I would dearly appreciate
  1. an explanation of the standard, RIGHT, CORRECT way to give a window
  a colormap such that the Window Manager will Honor and Obey it;

  2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
  desired colormaps.

By now I have exhausted my own attempts on this, having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable.

Below is example code giving the schematic for how I have been *TRYING*
to do this.  Please, please, please SOMEBODY tell me what I am doing
wrong/how to do it right!!!


Yours,

Chris Lee

I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  The
X distribution has support for this config, and the release notes say
it has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,
nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am I
supposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,
but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that can
be used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, but
I'm *really* confused.

Well that may be true.  However, the man page for pageview for OW 2.0
does not mention about DSC compliance.  In any event, the point here
is that if you try to display some PS files using pageview you will
find out that it's not a practical tool.

G'Day

Windows NT is a step forward, but not by much. I guess for DOS users who
think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to 
be able to use more than 64K of memory, its a major improvement. For Windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most Unix users take for 
granted. Most of  Windows users only use PCs for text processing or running 
3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
a real issue. My ideal operating system:

	Binary compatible across all plaforms. It should recognize
	binaries and configure on the fly, so I don't have to have
	bin/Mac bin/DOS bin/Dec bin/Sun bin/HP etc...

	Multi-CPU. So I can use the CPUs on my PC and W/S and Mac 
	and Transputers and DSPs. I don't know a single site which 
	has gone for a single vendor. I am not going to trade-in 
	80Mflops per H1 transputer or ultra-fast FFT on DSP chips.
	Note NT runs on Symmetric multi-CPU systems.

	Built-in portable GUI/Graphics tools. You can call DrawButton 
	or DrawLine and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
	or display. It should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
	so I can use PC graphics S/W on my workstation and X software on 
 	my PC. I think GUIs are not just nice to have but essential.

	Configurable front-end. So you can make it look like Unix or DOS
	or NT or OS/2, and run shell scripts or command/BAT files.

	Object oriented. So I can program easily under it and not have
	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.

In other words it should have some AI capability. That and a tight, clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. Anyone know of something like this ?

If you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your GC. You may 
use Xlib to draw over multiple windows. 
I have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

 curs_move = XCreateFontCursor (disp_data, XC_crosshair);

 geom_vals.foreground     = blck_pixl ^ grey_dark;
 geom_vals.plane_mask     = AllPlanes;
 geom_vals.line_width     = 0;
 geom_vals.function       = GXxor;
 geom_vals.subwindow_mode = IncludeInferiors;
 evnt_mask= GCForeground | GCPlaneMask | GCLineWidth | GCFunction
                                                     | GCSubwindowMode;
 geom_gcon= XCreateGC (disp_data, root_iden, evnt_mask, &geom_vals);



later I can move the rubber band or bands using the following logic

/**********************************************************************/
 void Tselect::move_bands (int delt_xloc, int delt_yloc)          /****/
stuff deleted ...
            XDrawRectangle (disp_data,   root_iden,  geom_gcon,

                            sele_pntr->xlnth, sele_pntr->ylnth); undraw old one
            sele_pntr->papax+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->papay+= delt_yloc;
            sele_pntr->rootx+= delt_xloc;
            sele_pntr->rooty+= delt_yloc;

Look in xfig.  It has two types of spline algorithms and is relatively simple.

Yes, but it's not an attribute of the window; it's an attribute of the
GC used to do the drawing.  Set the subwindow-mode to IncludeInferiors

  Let me add another of my concerns: Yes, I can buy a port of Motif for ""cheap"",
but I cannot get the source for ""cheap"", hence I am limited to using whatever X
libraries the Motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
Motif. I have been told that Motif 1.2 can be used with any X, but I have not
seen it myself).

  Currently, I have X11R5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
only three came with Motif. On those three, I am unable to use the X11R5
libraries to build Motif clients, because I get link errors between the
vendor-supplied port of Motif and my X11R5. I anticipate having this same
problem when X11R6 becomes available.

  The result is that I cannot build Motif clients that rely on X11R5, since I do
not have Motif compiled under X11R5. True, I could buy another port of Motif,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of ""free"", doesn't it?

    Cheers,

The following packages meet your criteria in that they are PD and
present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.

If you can use 386bsd:
	there is xview3 (OpenLook)

	there is Interviews which looks a little like Motif

	there is gopath a very nice C++ toolkit for Athena Widgets and Motif
	         which is simpler
                 and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                 technical support from Bull via e-mail
		 It has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
		 The data format is called streams which you can feed
		 to your programs. I ported gopath on an internet machine
		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
		 Last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
		 module. They have an MS-Windows driver module for instance.

	Also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
	applications. For instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
	With ease, I  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
	operations,etc.. The author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
	various environmental parameters from a router. I wrote  a simple
	strip chart script for displaying Real-Time ip received
	packets/seconds.


	Hope this helps,
	Amancio Hasty

While I have respect for John's ability and integrity, I really regret his
leaving just after a major release (or, more accurately, making the release
just before leaving).  Several of us are having problems with xv-3.00, and
in particular I have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made
to the Imakefiles and xv.h.  Without John to adjudicate, and everybody
posting fixes that work for *them*, chaos is inevitable; let's hope it is
temporary.

Subject: Vanishing font problem....
Organization: Department of Mathematics, Queen's University at Kingston
Lines: 25

   A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?

More info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),
       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.
       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.

As to how many clients may be display on a server, I believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.

Reply-To: D.Haywood@sheffield-hallam.ac.uk
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

Hi,

  Please reply to me direct as I am not a member of this list.

  I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: ""probably incorrect"")
terminology!

  Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process
is started by xdm.

  i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
     display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!

     The setup is as follows:

        lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
        ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                    tvtwm

     There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home
     directory.

     The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
     login window as expected - very nice!

     Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
     tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an
     xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
     expected.

     The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window
     and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
     the users session startup?

 ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
     and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

     ie: real key       key shown on screen
         ------------   -------------------
         hash           back slash
         tilde          pipe
         double quote   at symbol
         pound          hash
         cursor key     not recognised

     This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have
     installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and
     termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

     Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
     expected!

  Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

  Thanks,

Dave.

Subject: Standard Colormaps
Organization: MIT Microsystems Technology Laboratories
Lines: 49
Distribution: world
NNTP-Posting-Host: mtl.mit.edu

I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding 
standard colormaps.

The X11R5 documentation says: ""Usually, a window manager creates 
these colormaps.""  I wonder what window manager the writer had 
in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.

Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  
However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard 
colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  
So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very 
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps 
if every application used standard colormaps, things would 
be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use 
standard colormaps.

Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, 
XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent 
with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.

    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):

    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and 
    base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.  
    To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:

            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF

    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is 
    used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c
    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the 
    call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is 
    specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the 
    total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59% 
    of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.
    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation 
    to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.

    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap, 
    defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult, 
    and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3, 
    one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.

    When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1, 
    XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs 
    a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives 
    the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would 
    expect red_max to give the maximum gray value.

Are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences
as that for VT340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? I thought that was called
colxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or
might be my program going wrong).

I'm also unsure of what is meant by ""ansi mouse xterm""!

  I think you will find that the active Linux and 386BSD communities are
  populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.
  Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.
  An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always
  available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, I'm not
  really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting
  (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, C library or compiler patches come
  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for
  all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.
  Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.
  Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely
  adopted.

There is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. However in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed i.e.

void
SomeEventHandler(Widget w, XtPointer data, XEvent *event)
{
    /* Catch the button 1 (usually left button) */
    if ( event->xbutton.button == Button1 ) {
        /* do some action */
    } else {
        /* do nothing and exit from function */
    }

Given that all the source code contains explicit permission to use or
modify the code without fee in addition to the shareware notice, I would
say that the shareware notice is unenforceable.  All you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice.  Of course, this would be
circumventing the author's wishes on the subject, but I'd say if you're
not going to pay him no matter what, you'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach...  In fact, given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices, I'd guess none of it could ever be enforced, but not being
a lawyer, I can't be positive.

Regardless, the fees he's asking are not excessive, and I would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible.  Even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the
author, it would be reasonable to do so, to support his efforts if nothing
else.

Xt(App)AddTimeout doesn't work in xterm, because, despite appearances 
to the contrary, xterm is not really an Xt based application.  ""Other
sources"" like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm's main
loop. So don't be surprised when you try this and it doesn't work.

You don't mention your platform but Digital has a custom widget, NetEd, 
which does exactly what you want to do. Cost is nominal 300 or so - call your
local office.  The widget is supported on a variety of platforms and I heard
rumblings of porting to Sun, etc. so it may be worth the check.

Excuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, S3 928 ISA card, 8Mb XS3 (X11R5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65Mhz which I doubt 
that your XP10 series gets. Commerical verions X servers for S3 928 cards
can get 136k xstones. So the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which I have done in
my home setup.

Maintenance is minimal if you can read README files for the X servers and
for 386bsd.

XDM is not just an X Window client.  XDM has its own protocol (XDMCP) that

From my look at the source, it seems you cannot run it over DECnet as shipped

I tried to send this as private mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was
rejected, so here it is:

Here is an extract from the README file that comes with MacX:

Users of remote commands with Sun machines may find that their remote commands 
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the Sun machine.  This is due 
to a feature of the Sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
requesting machines that are not known to the Sun|s network address (/etc/hosts
or NIS hosts) database.  To successfully use remote commands with a SunOS-based
machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
Macintosh which is running MacX.

Subject: Keyboard mapping and window placement questions
Nntp-Posting-Host: fpddet4.mentorg.com
Organization: mentor
Keywords: 
Lines: 27

These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions.

1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?
My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a 
modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I can't seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that
when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated
(non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I don't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all 
O'Reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by Xt...'.  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of 
the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier 
requirements.

2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left
sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window 
manager's border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone
who has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move
and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y
and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.

Any help would be most appreciated.

The *fastest* way is to use an X server with shared memory extension. It uses
shared memory if it is a local X server (hence images don't have to be duplicated),
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available, or if it's  not the localhost.

It works on xterms. At least I have no problem with it. - Back to the original
question:

I usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. Here is a sample command:

	xterm -sl 999 -n ls12i -title ls12i -e rlogin ls12i &

The -n and -title options give the text for window and icon. As I use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh), I can do the following:

I have an

	alias precmd echo -n '^[]2\;${HOST}:$cwd^G'

in my ~/.tcshrc. This is a special alias for tvtwm. It is executed each time
before printing the prompt. So, I have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

I'm not all too sure about my viewing software.  I *hand*-converted this

For folks who haven't the slightest, it went like this:

-------------------------------------------------------------

		How to Make Your Own X-Face:
		   in 0x000F Easy Steps!

	1. Scan my Drivers' License into a *.PCX file.
	2. Use WinGIF to 'trim' my face out of the license,
		'reduce' it by half, and
		convert it to *.BMP.
	3. Use Paintbrush to touch up manually.
	4. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half again.
	5. Use Paintbrush to touch up again.
	6. Use WinGIF to 'reduce' it by half *again*
		and convert it to *.GIF.

		[now over to the UNIX side...]

	7. Use Snapshot to convert the *.GIF to a Sun rasterfile.
	8. Use IconEdit to touch it up and
		convert it to an X bitmap.
	9. Use ""vi"" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert
		the rasterfile into the ""Uncompressed X-Face"" format.
		(Lots of global ""ed"" commands, and by the time you're
		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)

		[now over to the *Linux* side...]

	A. Use ""compface"" to convert it to what you see here:

 %:A<m@Dob}BO""'E"",EEQGbn7qy(En7aS5U([k//""G{6^HIbY9X8~+PD($}6szF""&vVxCXSn
 8mw^0G#nVHE%W,`X""[j0s{r.~%zs:O|HFU=LwzYgH

	B. Try viewing it by whatever means you have available.
	C. Go back to step 9, but do it *right* this time.

Check into the vopl and vogle libraries.  I beleive that I still have

I have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as

To: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu


Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several
Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, 
2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,
4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely
operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual 
manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found 
it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for
many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle
TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily
modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.

Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and
SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.
It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will
need Motif 1.1 or better.

The following files are available for anonymous ftp from 
ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking

tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries
tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries

What tcpview adds to tcpdump:
- easier interface
- enhanced protocol decoding
- hex display of frame
- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt
- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name
- ethernet address host table
- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames
- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional
	processing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1

New features:

Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the 
file type will be automatically detected.

Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.

The hex format has been changed.

New time options have been added.

Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.

Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)

New flags:
-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin
-ttt	prints delta times
-tttt	prints times relative to the first frame
-W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w)
-x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  
	Sample output:

16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384
        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.

-X	print TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)

Subject: chars of big fonts are shown partially
Organization: Research Institute for Discrete Mathematics, Bonn

Hi all,

I wrote a small application which uses pixmaps copied into a window
to show some drawings. This works perfectly for all kind of objects
expect large fonts. What happens on the screen is that the right
half of the font is not shown. The way I create these things is
quite simple; some aggregated code:

XFillRectangle(Disp, Pixs, AnyColor, 0, 0, Width, Height);
XDraw[Line|Rect|String](...);
XCopyArea(Disp, Pixs, Win, 0, 0, Width, Height, 0, 0);

I am using a RS6K 340 with BOS 3.2.

The question is:
  is this a bug in the AIX X-server (may be some PTFs), or did I do
  something wrong within my code??

Sorry for the cross-posting, but I really do not know what kind of
error it is.

This is incorrect.  Sun has made no such claim regarding Devguide, and as 
manager of the Devguide engineering group I can state with authority that
work on Devguide is continuing apace.  We had quite a strong show of interest
from the Devguide user community at last week's Solaris Developer's Conference.
Devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but
as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current
customers and facilitate their migration to the COSE Desktop Environment.

If you have specific questions about Devguide availability, etc., you can

Yes, by utilizing the MIT-SHM extension, that provides an XPutImage
derivate that uses shared memory. Fine fast.

No. You can still XPutImage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using XCopyArea()
BUT be aware, this is a major server memory bummer !

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

This is still not great, since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item ""on top"" of the
existing scene.

If you're on the internet and your site isn't sheltered from external
tcp/ip traffic, you can use the Remote Andrew Demo to see what the
Andrew Toolkit looks like:

Remote Andrew Demo Service

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the Andrew software.  You
need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be running the X11
window system.  A simple ""finger"" command will allow you to experience
ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be able to compose multimedia
documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the
Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups.

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the following command
on your machine:

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

I ran in to this problem I while ago, and from what I remember you should use
XtTranslateCoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate
the location of the popup, then use something like XtVaSetValues on the
popup widgets before ever using them.  Calling SetValues repeatedly (e.g.
every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  I never
delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...

We are adding a Motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.

These programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:
- use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
  otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
- use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
  otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
- update the display according to latest data and messages.

We typically have several of these running in windows,
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
Everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.

Xt and Xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.
O'Reilly Vol IV Ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also
how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.

We can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.
The problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.
Neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.

The unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.
We want that for the X main loop except not file i/o.
Any suggestions or examples most welcome!

We run SGI Personal Iris and Indigo systems.

rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc -M' or 'gcc -M' or 'gcc -MM' (which is

It has been known to occur when displaying on the Xsun (X11R4) server.  It
occurs with a higher frequency when the client displays on the Xdomain
(X11R4) server running on DomainOS 10.3.5 on an Apollo.

Anybody know why this may be happening? Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated.

Reply-To: has been set to me.  I'll summarize to the net.

I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.
This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be
able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC
which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set
to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to 
my IP address I get a ""Error: Can't open display"" message. 

This can't be that hard to work around can it?

BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)
and having them display on my PC.

The colormap element of SetWinAttrib must be a legitimate TrueColor
colormap. So, use XCreateColormap() with the proper visual and use it
in SetWinAttrib (and don't forget the mask!).

And the inevitable caveat: I usually use widgets, setting the visual
and colormap resources rather than direct X routines, so I could be
wrong. But, I think this is the general difficulty.

Hi All!

I tried to run SoftPC, a PC emulation software program, installed on a Silicon 
Graphics workstation from a Human Design System (HDS) X terminal, and 
everything went fine, except the fonts could NOT be converted from one type 
of format to the other - HDS uses different font format from SGI worksation.
So, I have the following questions:

1. How do you resolve different font formats from different machines?

2. Is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?

If you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please 
let me know.  Your help will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your help and information.

I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100
to:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85

I determined that my 19"" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
active screen area and dividing by resolution.

However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.
After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe
that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
path, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but
not for the family I am using (Helvetica).

I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command

xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).

The command  

xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).
Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can
generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a
resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.

Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can
do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about
my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).
This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: ""Yup, thats
an inch"".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?

	Hi. I'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
place the window where the create window command tells it,
regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has
reason to know better)

	I don't want to set the override-redirect because I do
want all the embellishments that the window manager gives, I just
want the wm to accept my choice of location.

	I've tried twm, tvtwm and mwm and they are all

----------------------------------------------------------------------

o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code
  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with
  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,
  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,
  etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,
  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X
  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,
  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the
  Intrinsics are not especially useful.

o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The
  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It
  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless
  widgets or gadgets.

o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below
  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib
  functions because Xt provides most such services although an
  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a
list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem
specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.

The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop
about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.

        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has
three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and
border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap
resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these
resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the
shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen
and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is
not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is
created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.  

How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a
little harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.

/*
 * Some sample code to start up an application using something other
 * than the default visual.
 *
 * To compile:
 *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm
 *
 * To run:
 *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow
 *
 * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap
 * to install.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Which visual should an application use?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to
be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some
such).

Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server
allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in
TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may
be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor
or just monochrome.

As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different
possible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static
color, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above 
plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.

A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A
reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This
is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.
it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.

If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the
visual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was
especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.

It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The
Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any
pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then
performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have
completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the
list is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among
other things.

As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the
Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open
sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):


	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}

	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
		Widget		gw;		/* widget */
		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		exit (0);
	}

One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.  

This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.

One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and
difficult to maintain practices.

Try the following code instead.

	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>

	extern Widget ToplevelGet (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw
	#endif
	);

	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		XtPointer	closure
	#endif
	);

	extern void ExitCallback (
	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes
		Widget		gw,
		XtPointer	closure,
		XtPointer	call_data
	#endif
	);

	Widget
	ToplevelGet (gw)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */
	{
		Widget		top;

		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))
			/* empty */;
		return (top);
	}


	void
	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)
	Widget		gw;		/* widget */
	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */
	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */
	{
		Widget		toplevel;

		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);
		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */
		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);
		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),
				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);
	}

	Boolean
	ExitWorkProc (closure)
		XtPointer	closure;
	{
		exit (0);
		/*NOTREACHED*/
	}


ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11. How do I resize a Shell widget?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget
using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the
Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request.  However, the Shell must have the resource
XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.

To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not
the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF
-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based
OS's it is the poll() system call.

How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on
BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".

It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_
reliable.  In particular:

	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while
	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other
	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race
	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.

	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.

	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing
	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having
	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had
	  been given the whole block).


Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as
read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this
point I don't know.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already
familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may
not find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which
means its a 1000 pages.

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The
	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification"", Digital Press,
	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by
	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC
	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.

The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:

Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with
	Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).
	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)

And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.
O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt
reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it
very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.

I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"".
These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource""
is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the
MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no
advertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For
orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial
matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in
~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.


""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a
fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call
(908) 563-9033.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
14. What Widgets are available?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are three popular widget sets:

Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most
	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is
	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.
Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think
	  it is poorly implemented.
OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets
	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by
	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.
	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.

In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:

Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software
	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked
	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,
	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen
	  them so I can't comment.
FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of
	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,
	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets
	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.
Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the
	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for
	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so
	  widely used.
Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but
	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.
Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written
	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.
	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was
	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided
	  much experience for the designers of Xt.
Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you
	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*

The following specialized widgets are also available:

Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif
	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.
Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).
	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.

15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

	__________________________________________
	Name		Language	Vendor
	__________________________________________
	Xview		C		Sun
	OI		C++		ParcPlace
	Interviews	C++		Stanford
	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu
	__________________________________________


However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)
	typdef struct
	{	
	    String	name;
	    long	value;
	} Arg;

and the code:
	Arg	arg;

	XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)

expands to
	Arg	arg;

	arg.name = ""name"";
	arg.value = 3.2;

you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value
gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  When
the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,
how to get around this?

The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions.

#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \
    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \
    } else { \
        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \
        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \
    }


----------------------------------------------------------------------
17. How do I write a resource converter?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):

The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)
Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.

There are several main types of resource converters:

    string to data type
    data type to string
    data type to data type

i) string to data type
    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often
    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:

	Name		Value
	""True""		1
	""False""		0

    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare
    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most
    readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the
    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,
    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the
    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.

    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then
    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of
    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks
    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
    of the converters.

ii) data type to string
    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,
    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,
    probably by the use of sprintf.

    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that
    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This
    mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state
    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to
    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.

    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to
    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure
    that they are consistent.

iii) data type to data type
    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be
    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for
    red, green and blue.


The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:

typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,
	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);
    Display *dpy;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;
    XrmValuePtr fromVal;
    XrmValuePtr toVal;
    XtPointer *converter_data;

When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source
X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the
destination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.

Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value:

typedef struct {
    unsigned int    size;
    caddr_t         addr;
} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;

When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.
In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If
the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return True.

If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return True.

When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro:

    #define DONE(var, type) \
      if (toVal->addr) \
	{ \
	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \
	    { \
	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
	      return False; \
	    } \
	  else \
	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \
      return True;

    #define DONESTR(str) \
      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \
	{ \
	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
	  return False; \
	} \
      else \
	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \
      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \
      return True;

Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.

Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the
Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.

To register a converter with a single application context, use
XtAppSetTypeConverter:

void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    XtAppContext context;
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

To register a converter with all application contexts, use
XtSetTypeConverter:

void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,
	cache, destructor)
    String from;
    String to;
    XtTypeConverter converter;
    XtConvertArgList args;
    Cardinal num_args;
    XtCacheType cache;
    XtDestructor destructor;

In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and
XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter
and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be
used.

When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached:

    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values
    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values
    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis

Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).

The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:

typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,
	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);
    XtAppContext context;
    XrmValuePtr to;
    XtPointer converter_data;
    XrmValuePtr args;
    Cardinal *num_args;

The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments
for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.

Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT
R5 distribution:

    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c
    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h

----------------------------------------------------------------------
18. How do I open multiple displays?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3,
(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a
nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_
application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.

The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can
happen 3 ways:
	1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays,
	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,
	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,
	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.

I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a
problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that
display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.

The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the
Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult
problem.

The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true
for a single display X based application, but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the
I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()
happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid
returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment
demonstrates this:

#include <setjmp.h>
jmp_buf XIOrecover;

void
XIOHandler (dpy)
	Display		*dpy;
{
	destroyDisplay (dpy);
	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);
}

main ()
{
	...
	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)
		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);
	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);
}

The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().

For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the
jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.

Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors
such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.

There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general
changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete,
list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are
listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Much of the following information is retrieved from Chapter 13 of the MIT
Xt Intrinsics Manual and from O'Reilly Volume 5, 3rd edition.

From R3 to R4
- Addition of gadgets (windowless widgets)
- New resource type converter interface to handle cacheing and
  additional  data.
- Variable argument list interface.
- #define XtSpecificationRelease 4  (added with this release)

20. Where are the resources loaded from?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority):

	1. Args passed at creation time.
	2. Command line arguments.
	3. User's per host defaults file
	4. User's defaults file.
	5. User's per application default file.
	6. System wide per application default file.

Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result
of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.

The per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either
specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not
set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.

The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is
used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is
reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER
but most do not.

A user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.

The system wide per application default files are typically found in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.

[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]

You can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables
control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an
application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file
from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path
defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.

Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open
Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in
/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for
XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files
in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your
OPENWINHOME is located):

	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N

The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of
pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see XtResolvePathname()):

	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the
		application's class name.
	%T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the
		literal string ""app-defaults""
	%C	customization resource (R5 only)
	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.
	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")
	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")
	%t	The territory part of the display's language string
	%c	The codeset part of the display's language string

Let's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is
""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.
(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)

	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm
	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm

As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above
app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it
reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of
this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.

Let's consider another example. This time, let's set
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current
working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N

The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands
to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the
app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.

NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,
      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is
      defined so %T and %S are useless.

With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization
resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application
like this:

	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""

If one of your pathname specifications had the value
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be
""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.

The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:

		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)
		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\
		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N

(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this
batch of default settings.)

The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 

		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)
		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)
		<root>/%L/%N:\
		<root>/%l/%N:\
		<root>/%N:

<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory
if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some
value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.

Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set
XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked
differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR
value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.

21. What order are callbacks executed in?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)

The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.

The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.

Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback
says:

 	""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the
 	procedure is to be appended.""
 
you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
22. How do I know if a widget is visible?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)

> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible
> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core
> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag
> stays set to TRUE.

Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency""
in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way,
in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section
carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.

A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;
that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.
Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;
see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.

> Is this a problem with ""mwm"" or is there something
> else which needs to be done?

You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.

> If the problem is ""mwm"", what is the fastest
> way to determine if a window is iconified? 

As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action
routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget
which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the
map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are
suggestions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can't.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is
handled something like:

	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))
	if (!ptr)
	{
		perror (""malloc in xyzzy()"");
		exit (1)
	}
To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions
XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which
all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and
realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.

In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses
XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:

	if (!ptr)
		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));
	else
		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));
	++count;

to be written as:

	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);

Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've
found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm
allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so
I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.

XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string:

	  struct abc *xyzzy;
	  char	     *ptr;
	  char	     *str = ""abcdef"";

	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */
	  ptr = XtNewString (str);

A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:

	 char	      *ptr;

	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);
	 /* ... */
	 free (ptr);

may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.

A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string
when they should really be using XmStringFree().

----------------------------------------------------------------------
25. How to debug an Xt application?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I'd recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is a
great package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey
at $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb
(contact support@pure.com for more info).

	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These
	instructions check every memory read and write performed by
	the program under test and detect several types of access
	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past
	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts
	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including
	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies
	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory
	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly
	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
	down typically by a factor of two to five.

An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on
many Unix's and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging
Environment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library
functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com
for more info)

Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in
synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line
argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then
set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the
original Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous
mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.

Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the
undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource
""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
For example:

    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &
    example% xwininfo -tree
	     <click in new xload window>

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.

Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it's children, you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both.  It's a very clever idea.

The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.

The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly
using a command sequence like this:

	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;
	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.
	or this:
	othermachine% xhost +thismachine
	thismachine% gdb application
	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0
	(gdb) run ...

I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.

Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,
   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when
   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
   perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens. 

The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those
routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts,
you won't get those events.

For example:

	...
	cnt = 0;
	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,
				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),
				   &argc, argv,
				   Fallback, args, cnt);

	XtAddTimeOut (...)
	XtAddWorkProc (...)

	XtAppMainLoop (app)

would never invoke the timeout.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)

Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an
``intuitive'' fashion.

Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has
supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with
each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.

I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on Xt).

The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM
conventions, for more details read the code.

I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif
anyway.

The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also
available on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.

An application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  I'd like to be

Is there a way to do this in X (specifically OW 3.0 on SPARCs)?  Is there a

I am just beginning to try using the Athena toolkit and am having some problems

the possibility that they are just in a different directory.  When I try to link
my program it can't find XtInitailize, XtRealizeWidget, XtMainLoop, 
XtCreateManagedWidget, or commandWidgetClass.  I've included Intrinsic.h and
Command.h.  I also had a problem on compile with XtNcallback but replaced that with

  Hello, I hope this is the right group to post this in.
  I've got a little problem.  I finally managed to get a REAL operating
system (Linux, as opposed to MS-Dos) and I like it alot.  But, when I
try to run 'startx', I get a strange response: My monitor goes into
graphics mode and I get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's
all! Nothing else!  Now, I've collected almost every FAQ in the world to
help me but either it's too confusing or I must be missing something.
  My setup:
	386DX (about 20Mhz)
	Trident 8900C SVGA (w/1 Meg)
	4 MB RAM
	Plenty of HD space
Any help is appreciated.
Thanx.

I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect
English constructs such as ""its raining"" or ""it's window id"" annoy me.
However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way
things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS
was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technically
superior as well!).

On a related topic, who is to say that ""color"" is more or less correct
than ""colour"" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed
to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API
terms such as ""XAllocColor"" and ""colormap"".

In a world that uses the term ""Windows"" to refer to Microsoft Windows,
perhaps the time has come to accept ""X Windows"" as a valid term for X.
I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,
""the X Window System"" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.
Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate
people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,
snappy, descriptive title (""X"" is positively obscure) will help
when dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was a
software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become
popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should
be called ""Microsoft Windows"" or ""the Microsoft Window System"" or
how about just plain ""Microsoft""!

To summarise (or should that be ""summarize"") the point of this message:
I think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than
worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system
(or should that be ""windowing system""). Whatever gets recognised is
fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what
trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this
conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.

According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give
the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So
a ""hourglass"" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a
""caution"" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in
another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.
So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain
subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined
for some windows, e.g. a ""crosswire"" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even
more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this
so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me
know. The topics on ""busy cursors"" in the several FAQ's are not helpful, since
they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window
attribute set to 'None'.

[again, poseted for a friend]

Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), 
lets try again:

How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color.

Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another
application.

So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my
colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
read-only/shareable stuff directly...

Any ideas?

Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?

Client Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, X11R5
Server Hardware:	Sun IPC
Server Software:	SunOs 4.1.1, Open Windows 3.0 (w/ patch 100444-37)

A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will
unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server isn't hanging. If I log in from
another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets
back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers
(including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no
problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a
work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.

I have tried the following things:

    1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch
       (100444-37).

    2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

    3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).
       This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of
       menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and
       screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I
       was still able to get the application to hang.

Repeat By:

This is an intermittent problem so you'll have to try several times.

Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

Click and release on a menu item

Repeat until application hangs


Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

They come with every Iris now.  Nth also ships it with their latest
version of Nth Portable GL.  I just got the update a couple of weeks
ago.  I would assume that Silicon Graphics would license the source
to you so that you can include it in your company's GL offering.

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
Window is mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped.  Do you know the best way to ""tickle"" a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?

Why is that terrible ? That's exactly the way our code has been doing

I have the exact same problem when running Hewlett Packard's Microwave Design
System (MDS) from an HP 380 unix box and running MacX 1.2, Sys 7.0.1*.
Normally, MDS draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become
""washed out"" (nearly invisible). I thought that it was just something
brain dead that I was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or INIT.

By slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.

check prep.ai.mit.edu.  It's called fax-3.2.1.tar.Z or something to
that effect and is the software for netfax. Be forewarned that it
requires (at the moment) a fairly costly $450 fax modem with certain

No. As soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. The way to do it
is masking: Create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. Then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use GXCopy,
and XCopyArea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

Subject: 'makedepend' problem
Organization: Information Resources Inc.
Lines: 46

Hi, netters:

We have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
#if clause in C preprocessor statements. It evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are.
For example, makedepend chokes on one of X11 include files (as distributed
by Sun) - namely Xos.h:

#if     !defined(SUNOS41) || defined(__STDC__)
#       include <string.h>
#       define  index   strchr
#       define  rindex  strrchr
#else   /* BSD && !__STDC__ */
#       include <strings.h>
#endif  /* !SUNOS41 || __STDC__ */

Here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist
under Solaris2.
We also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.
We got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.

In all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (Sun's
distribution) mentions this problem:

BUGS
     If you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  Berkeley  C
     preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
     that all #if directives will evaluate to  ""true""  regardless
     of  their  actual  value.  This may cause the wrong #include
     directives to be evaluated.  Makedepend should  simply  have
     its own parser written for #if expressions.

Has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
WriteYourOwnParser... and willing to share it with us?

Since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 
directly to my e-mail address -> I'll post a summary.

Thanks in advance.

One way to ""mask"" the left button check the contents of the XEvent that the
XAddEventHandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the
show_mouse_position function. 

If the XEvent arrive in this function as 

XEvent p_event;

then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. So, 
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. In case
it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. 

By the way, you mentioned the Button1MotionMask and if anyone can help me with 
these MotionMasks I would be grateful. I can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. In 
essence I would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. 
Unfortunately, the XEvent sent by a MotionMask does not seem to contain the 
value of the pressed button.

Any ideas,

Subject: How to draw in Invert mode with Color
Organization: Chemical Abstracts Service
Lines: 21

  How can I draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors
  and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?

  What's happening is this,

      If I draw it using GXcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  If I erase
      it using GXcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases 
      whatever it overlayed.  I then need to redraw
      all of the items it crossed.  Yuch.

      If I draw it using GXinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing 
      resembling what I requested.  It properly restores the color of 
      underlying objects in erase mode.

  What's the solution?

Yes, but it's broken on OW 2.0.  It does not handle multiple pages
well.  If you don't have the proper PostScript commands it will
draw the entire document on the same page instead of pausing after

Look up XV_DEPTH.  Also, you might want to try using XView colormap segments
instead of Xlib for your colormap stuff.  They will probably be easier
for you to use, and since you are using a TrueColor visual, you won't
be losing anything compared to straight Xlib.

The code fragment looks reasonable, but is your logic valid?
Just because something appears in an 8 bit deep pixmap doesn't
mean every bit plane contains data.  Did you try each plane?

At Robert Gordon University, programming was the main (most time-consuming) 
start of the course. The first two years consisted of five subjects:
Software Engineering (Pascal/C/UNIX), Computer Engineering (6502/6809/68000 
assembler), Computer Theory (LISP/Prolog), Mathematics/Statistics and 
Communication Skills (How to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. How to survive a helicopter crash in the North Sea).
The third year (Industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company 
for a year. The company could be anywhere in Europe (there was a special 
Travel Allowance Scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  
The fourth year included Operating Systems(C/Modula-2), Software Engineering 
(C/8086 assembler), Real Time Laboratory (C/68000 assembler) and Computing 
Theory (LISP).  There were also Group Projects in 2nd and 4th Years, where 
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
suddenly).
 
In the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and 
exams for most subjects. However in the Honours year, this was reduced to a 
30%:70% split between an Individual Project and final exams (no coursework 
assessment) - are all Computer Science courses like this?

BTW - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
Honours year. Also, every course is tutored separately. Not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). 

Cheers,

Dear sun and windows people,

I am running sun workstations with SunOs 4.1.1 and 
vanilla X11 R5. I have a bunch of xterminals as well.

Today I had my xdm fail. At about 9:30
it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.
The message was the ""xdm too many retransmissions"".
In my xdm-errors file I had the following entries:


  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256
  >error (pid 7927): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be
  >secured
  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:

  >I also had:

  >error (pid 7462): WARNING: keyboard on display :0 could not be
  >secured
  >error (pid 7423): Server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
  >256

Also, at the console, the login box would come up for
about 2 seconds and then
it would go away. It would do this continuously.

I could login from another workstation to the hosts in question,
however, I could not login on the console.

I tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help.
I finally rebooted all the hosts. (Which hurts when done in the
middle of the day).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Phil

I *think* this is correct behavior.  Remember the default
colormapFocusPolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus).  Since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.

Since it sounds as though you have keyboardFocusPolicy:pointer, I
suggest you set colormapFocusPolicy:pointer also.  That way, the cmap
focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardFocusPolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
MB1).

I had exactly the same feeling.  I was depressed.  If you ever programmed
Windows and X11, you'd be depressed if an X conference touted its tutorials
to show you how to convert from X to Windows API.  Sort of like, ""how to

Subject: dynamic SqueezeTitle configuration in *twm
Keywords: TWM, twm, vtwm, tvtwm, ctwm
Organization: Systems Strategies, Inc., NY, NY
Lines: 123

I consider TWM-style Squeezed Titles indispensable in a window
manager. I like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time, with no overlap; and since two windows aren't enough, I have
other xterm windows underneath them, with exactly the same positioning.

In case you're not familiar with Squeezed Titles, here's a crude
picture:

 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================
 |
 |    +---------+                   +---------+          +=========+
 |    + title A +                   + title B +          + title C +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |    +   this is the          +    + window B hides window C, but +
 |    +     body of the        +    + you can still see C's title  +
 |    +      window, window A  +    + which is squeezed right.     +
 |    +------------------------+    +------------------------------+
 |
 ====================== Figure 1 ====================================

Squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack,
with easy access; and 3 per stack is usually more than I really
need, since I also insist on having a virtual WM.

The only problem is that the title location is static, that is,  it
is configured in .twmrc, and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager. Doing so is cumbersome and
time-consuming.

Therefore, I have implemented f.squeeze{ left, center, right }
functions in my own copy of vtwm; the idea being that with one click
of a button, you can change this:

    +---------+
    + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

to this:

                   +---------+
                   + title A +
    +------------------------+
    +   this is the          +
    +     body of the        +
    +      window, window A  +
    +------------------------+

 ===============

Okay. So far, so good. Now, how the heck do I get them to put this
into the next ""official"" twm, and the next tvtwm, and the next vtwm,
and the next ctwm? And the next xyztwm that I never heard of?

One way would be to post, in comp.windows.x, a description of this
enhancement, together with an explanation of why I think it is a
Very Good Thing, and hope that someone reads it. :-)

In case it isn't already clear why I think it's a Very Good Thing,
look back up at Figure 1, and picture window A moved over on top of
windows B and C; now window A's title hides Window B's title;
but when you hit f.squeezecenter, the result is:

        +=========+   +---------+   +=========+
        + title B +   + title A +   + title C +
        +-------------------------------------+
        +   this is the body of the window,   +
        +   window A, which is on top.        +
        +-------------------------------------+

 ===================

The rest of this posting explains how to implement it, based on my
X11R4 copy of vtvwm.shar; it's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
ExecuteFunction() routine in menus.c:

#ifdef SHAPE
	case F_SQUEEZELEFT:
	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 };
		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor))
		  return TRUE;

		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze;
		SetFrameShape( tmp_win );
		break;
	}
	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and
	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ...
#endif

( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h
  and add
    { ""f.squeezeleft"", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },
     ... and so forth ...
to parse.c

In order to use these functions, add something like the
following to your .twmrc file:

Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter

 =================

About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I
*think* it didn't get out.

Since then, ""blast"" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19,
Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by
chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title. Better to have a
twm-style window manager, I think.

fix the table in .../X11R5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
use xmodmap(1).

put
  stty pass8; setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1; setenv LESSCHARSET latin1
in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character

Does USL SVR4 support LD_RUN_PATH a la Solaris 2?
Or an equivalent?

If so, you can put the library in a package specific lib directory,
compile the app with LD_RUN_PATH defined, and all should work.

Besides, I'd say name it libPACKAGExcl.a if possible.

It's my understanding that the next release of UIM/X, due out
last February :-) has full support for C++.

I use XDesigner which does not have the interpreter or UI meta languages
of these other tools but does fully support C++ code generation,
reusable templates via C++ classes which are generated, a variety of
other handy features for using C++ and layout functions in different
ways, and generates Motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop, 
internationalization, etc.).  Fits in quite nicely with Doug Young's
paradigm for C++/Motif.

Available in the US from VI Corp, in Europe from Imperial Software,
London (see FAQ for details).

You've got to set border_pixel in your window attributes. The default
is CopyFromParent which gives the BadMatch. Do this:

   ...
   unsigned long valuemask;
   ...
   /*
    * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
    * rather than use any old pixel value. Also, use valuemask, it makes

   attr.colormap = cmap;
   attr.border_pixel = 0;
   valuemask = CWColormap | CWBorderPixel;
   win = XCreateWindow(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           10,10,
           width,height,
           0,		         /* border width. see comment below */
           8,                    /* depth */
           InputOutput,          /* class */
           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
           valuemask,
           &attr
         );

A note on border_width: your code looked like this:

>>   win = XCreateWindow(
>>           dpy,
>>           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
>>           10,10,
>>           width,height,
>>           CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
>>           8,                    /* depth */
>>           InputOutput,          /* class */

>>           CWColormap,
>>           &attr
>>         );

border_width set to CopyFromParent works but doesn't make sense.
border_width should be an unsigned int. You get away with it because
CopyFromParent is #define'ed to be zero in X.h. If it happened to be
defined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!

Subject: 24-bit Static color: will clients like it?
Reply-To: roeber@cern.ch
Organization: CERN -- European Organization for Nuclear Research
Lines: 24

I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The
hardware is ""truecolor"" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit
static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just
present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be 
acceptable to ""most"" X clients.  The three problems I see are:

  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.
  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the
     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.

Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these
limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff
floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, 
but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.

I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's
opinions and suggestions.  Thanks!

Try the 'M.Sc. Computing Science' course at the REAL Newcastle University.
It's a conversion course, but at least they teach REAL programming.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda.
Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
and some stuff about comms.   

The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learn't this (and 
X Windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.

The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought
invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.

Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!

I have been using a HDS X-terminal, and really like it. What
is really powerful is that it can run the X server without
running a window manager. One can then run a special client
X program called a window manager, either (1) run 
motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network
traffic - but having no HOME). or (2) run motif or openlook
from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).

This is powerful, especially since I can exit one window manager
(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
(Some of my VMS tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other).

Well the question is:

  On a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to
  break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? Basically I
  want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run
  the window manager.

---
Please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the
large volumes in window.X)

Thanks.

Well, thanks largely to subscribers of this group, here's xrastool 1.0,
the animation package I started just over 3 weeks ago. A number of the
solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in
the code, so have a look! The full blurb has been posted to
comp.windows.x.announce.

This post is in two parts. To unpack the source code, extract the
articles into file1 and file2 (for example). Use a text editor to
remove leading and trailing text at the ""---cut here---"" markers
(including the markers themselves). Next type ""cat file1 file2 >
file"", then ""uudecode file"" and ""zcat xrastool1.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -"".
Read the README file for instructions on how to proceed from there.
Enjoy!

Derek

P.S. The source is also available for anon ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
in the contrib/ directory. If there is enough demand, a static binary
will be provided for those without the XView libraries or include
files.

Subject: Help. BadMatch making 24bit win on 8bit server !!
Organization: CCI europe, Research and Development
Lines: 72



I'm trying to make a 24 bit window using XCreateWindow on a 8 bit
PseudoColor server. As far as I know this should be possible if you
server supports a TrueColor or DirectColor visual. I'm using a
Sun IPC with a RasterFLEX card.

Running xdpyinfo gives:
...
screen #0:
  dimensions:    1152x900 pixels (352x275 millimeters)
  resolution:    83x83 dots per inch
  depths (4):    1, 5, 8, 24
  root window id:    0x80083
  depth of root window:    8 planes
  number of colormaps:    minimum 1, maximum 6
  default colormap:    0x80080
...
  number of visuals:    8
  default visual id:  0x80079
...
  visual:
    visual id:    0x80079
    class:    PseudoColor
    depth:    8 planes
    size of colormap:    256 entries
    red, green, blue masks:    0x0, 0x0, 0x0
    significant bits in color specification:    8 bits
  visual:
    visual id:    0x8007a
    class:    TrueColor
    depth:    24 planes
    size of colormap:    256 entries
    red, green, blue masks:    0xff, 0xff00, 0xff0000
    significant bits in color specification:    8 bits
  visual:
    visual id:    0x8007b
    class:    DirectColor
    depth:    24 planes
    size of colormap:    256 entries
    red, green, blue masks:    0xff, 0xff00, 0xff0000
    significant bits in color specification:    8 bits


My code looks like this:

if ((Xio.DspPtr = XOpenDisplay(NULL)) == NULL)
    logexit(1, ""Cannot connect to X server %s"", XDisplayName(NULL));

Xio.Scr = DefaultScreen(Xio.DspPtr);   /* use this screen                 */

if (XMatchVisualInfo(Xio.DspPtr, Xio.Scr, 24,
		     DirectColor, &Xtern.ColorInfo))
{
   memset(&SetWinAttrib, 0, sizeof(XSetWindowAttributes));
   Xio.GSwin = XCreateWindow(Xio.DspPtr, RootWindow(Xio.DspPtr, Xio.Scr),
			     x, y, w, h, 0, 24, InputOutput,
			     Xtern.ColorInfo, 0, &SetWinAttrib);
}


This results in a BadMatch error. Can anyone please tell me why ?

We have a Sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card.

The cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual.
The default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to
the 24-bit visual. We have tried using XGetVisualInfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no
success.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome. 

There are two possible solutions:
	If someone has patches for X11R5 Xsun server, could they forward them to us?

	Otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows?

I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
file servers, and each other. It's not _too_ much of a load on our
Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.

But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have
10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.

Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)

I use xwd and xwd2ps. To do it from within a program I use
xwd -id xxxxx where xxxxx is the window id obtained from XtWindow(widget).

It seems silly, but while I've located things like tgif that can  edit
gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, I haven't
been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a
gif file in it.  I've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail.
Is there one lurking about in some  archive?   Nothing  sophisticated;
just ""show the pretty picture""?

Alternatively, if I could locate the specs for gif, I don't suppose it
would be too hard to write it myself, but I have no idea where to even
start looking for the spec.  (Well, actually, I do have an idea - this

There is a widget already defined for GL.  It is the GlxMDraw (motif) or
GlxDraw (athena) widget.  It is similar to a XmDrawingArea, except that it
allows you to use GL calls to render into the window.  Look at glxlink,
glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

The GlxMDraw widget works pretty well.  OpenGL will be an improvement.

I think GL is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
that's just an opinion.  Mileage may vary.

I always use the following in my .[t]cshrc:

...
f ( $?LOGIN == 0 ) then
   source $home/.login
endif
...

and in .login:

...
setenv LOGIN 1
...

So I don't need to set all environment variables in my .cshrc, but they get
set if I login via xdm or xon | xrsh | rx and so on.

Hope this helps,

Bernward

I think you are running Xapollo , it's a X11R3 server ...

If you want a X11R4 server you should install PSKQ3 (10.3.5) or 10.4
  so you can run Xdomain .

I am writing a X-based dosemu which requires XKeyReleasedEvent. 
I found the keycode of XKeyReleasedEvent is wrong.   If I run the program on
a Linux host(XFree1.2) with  DISPLAY set to the local Linux and to
the Sun host (X11R5), the two keycodes from the two Xservers are different. 
Of course, the keycode of XKeyPressedEvent is O.K.

Can anybody verify this ?     Did I do anything wrong ?

What I was talking about was using an Tek terminal as your X display.  I
should be possible to write an X server that does this as far as I can
tell, but what I'm asking is if there is already one.

Subject: XFree86 and Esix 4.0.4
Organization: AT&T

Keywords: esix

Hello Netlanders:

       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.

       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:

       486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4 
       Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.
       I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and
       inet utilities (tcp/ip).
       I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.
 
 I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.
 However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the
 machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the
 tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to
 startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background
 pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login
 from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.

 I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4
 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also 
 claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't
 need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get
 XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
 packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

 I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same
 system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.
 
 One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,
 what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

 Thanks,

Does anyone know where these missing functions are located? If you do can you
help me with it?

I posted before to one of the other Unix groups, I tried their suggestions but
always get this error.

If you have to know: I am using Unix system V. The machines here are 486's. The
terminals I want to use are separate and just called X-terminals and they seem
dedicated to that. I'm not sure as to what they really are, since it is one of
my first times out with this X-windows gidget! That is, first time programming
for it, so to speak. I use them alot just for the graphics things.

If you can help, mail me soon.

I have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up
to NOT remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens
when bold is displayed.  It would appear (at least in X11R4) than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.
I wish someone would prove that incorrect.

Subject: Installation problem with X11R5

Lines: 32

I am in the process of installing X11R5 on my Sun Sparcstation 2 and
have run into a problem.  I imagine it has something to do with a missing
screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there
in Internet land might be able to help.

I am installing it on a machine that already has OpenLook installed, and would
like to have both installed concurrently.  Thus, I set it up to compile to my
/usr/X11R5 directory.  I worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  I need it installed for PEX-SI,
so I set all those appropriate flags.  When I run it, however, I get a message
along the lines of:

Getting interface configuration : Operation not supported on socket

sunOpenFrameBuffer : Inappropriate ioctl for device

Fatal server error : no screens found 


Any ideas on how I can fix it?  Please respond by e-mail at the below
address.

Thanks in advance.

I'm having an X resource problem using Brian Wilson's wscrawl 2.0
(a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  I'm 
running OpenWindows 3.0 on a SPARC 1+ under OS 4.1.3.  I have
the following defaults in my .Xdefaults file (among many others):
  wscrawl.telePointerName:	Kevin
  wscrawl.syncScrollbars:		True
  wscrawl.continuousTelePointer:	True
  wscrawl.showPointerCoordinates:	False
  wscrawl*background:		LightBlue
  wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow
  wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	Blue
  wscrawl*keyboardFocusPolicy:	pointer

Naturally, I exited the server and restarted it after adding
those lines to .Xdefaults .

If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):
  xrdb -m .Xdefaults
and then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used
properly.  Wonderful, yes?  Except that I can't get them to be
operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned
xrdb command.  If I try:
  xrdb .Xdefaults
the defaults ""won't take.""

So, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:
  xrdb  $HOME/.Xdefaults
to:
  xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults

No go.  So I tried adding in:
  xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults
at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  Still no go.

Any notions what gives?  Thanks for the help.

This design will work but I don't think it can take easily take advantage

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to

I highly recommend Starnet's Micro-X.  They have versions for DOS and Windows,
with support for PC/TCP, or the Clarkson packet drivers.  I have used it
successfully with twm, mwm, and olwm, over both ethernet and SLIP.
And their tech support is top notch.  They really impressed me.

If you are using the Intrinsics, it is parsed for you.  If you are working
at the Xlib level, you can parse it yourself or you can use the following
bit of code.

static XrmOptionDescRec options[] = {
	{""-geometry"",	"".geometry"",	XrmoptionSepArg, (XPointer)NULL}
};

#define Number(x)	(sizeof(x)/sizeof(x[0]))
XrmParseCommand(db, options, Number(options), ""MyApplication"", &argc, argv);

Then use XrmGetResource() to retrieve the value and parse it using
XParseGeometry().

It is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv, however, I much prefer
using the X resource management routines to do this.

| Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,

| documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-
| resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
| mentioned above...

There is no easy answer to this question: it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently
the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen
memory is the bane of the server implementor's existence!).  

I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to 
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than
off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)

If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are
likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OS's implementation
of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then
just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.

One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you don't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them.

One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation,
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., ""kill"").  You have to 
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

One can't.  The application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
it does it may be in no condition to be ""pop[ped] to the top"" (eg, it
may be iconified).  And even if you can, it may not do what you want -
consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
desktop.

Some (but not all) X terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window ID.  Even if such a thing is present in the
environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
on a different server, for example.

Hi Xperts, some simple questions for you:

I've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.
Who can give an exact definition what these terms mean:

	-) multi-screen
	-) multi-headed
	-) multi-display
	-) X-Server zaphod mode

Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle
(in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?

How is the capability called, if I want to move the cursor from one
screen/display to another.

Any hints welcome.

Thanks, rainer.

Glad to hear that it's working for you!

I couldn't find it on ""export"".  However, Simon Leinen

liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/X/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (Note the "".z""

If you installed X lib Xt by redefining ProjectRoot, you will find that
 during the install it recompiles one of the files in X lib that does the
search for XKeysmDB and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
ProjectRoot was defined. TO confirm this what happened, because I'm

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,
and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks
promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.

At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me
no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only
library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve.

Subject: How to make simplest possible composite widget?

Lines: 33
NNTP-Posting-Host: 140.239.3.202

Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.

I need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
additional resource name level.

To illustrate I have an application with the following widget
heirarchy:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Application Widghet

I want the following:

	    Shell Widget
	         |
	Intermediate Widget
	         |
	 Application Widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

I assume there's a simple way to do this but I can't find an example
and the documentation I have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

Please respond via email.  Any help will be very much appreciated.

Subject: Resources and cpp - HELP!

Hi,

I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).

Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different
values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and
not when the resources are loaded on demand.

Is there a proper solution to this?

So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2
different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.
But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).

Furthermore, I thought of using #include ""XTerm"" in XTerm-color.
However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,
things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource
is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the
LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do
about it?

I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I
can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the
resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

Thanks in advance for replying,
Marcel.

I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled
under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question,
because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000.
	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in, let's say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite
widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :

	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)

but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the
insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one, as the prototype suggests.  For example:

	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)

Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h,
or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.
	Many thanks in advance for any help.

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the
bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one
that is to stay with GXclear.  Then GXxor the entire pixmap with
the screen.  

Note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever

Issue 5 of the X Resource (the published proceedings of the 7th Annual X

titled ""Building Distributed interfaces with Fresco"".

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort.
Without doing a complete review of the paper, I'll just mention the goals
as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib.
Features they want in FRESCO include:

lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs
Structured Graphics
Resolution independence
Natural C++ programming interface
edit-in-place embedding
distributed user interface components
Multithreading

This by no means captures the complete content of the paper. The Conclusions
sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in Jan 93) for a complete sample
implementation.

Unfortunately it does.  I don't agree with the logic of NT at an X windows
conference.  Perhaps some good will come of it, but the two are so dissimilar
and the NT marketing stuff is so large in the Xhibition adds that I was 
coming to a similar conclusion as Jesse...

That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8
of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about 
10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons.

The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in Volume One,  chapter 9.  You should read this
to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
complicated.

We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms.  In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  It supports a rich API to a high
level IPC mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven
application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, Open Look,
Motif, MS-Windows and Mac (at the flip of a switch).

You are right in supposing that the problem is with the XmNcolormap
(XtNcolormap for truly literate beings) not being set.  What you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap.  This can be a
chicken and egg sort of problem, however.  If you look at the Xt FAQ
there is an example that should show how it can be done.  If not, let
me know and maybe I can improve the example.

Even 24Bit TrueColor machines are in most cases running an emulated
8 bit PseudoColor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and
thelike to run. I strongly suppose you to emulate at least:

From the FAQ:

Subject:  96)! What is this link problem with libXmu on SunOS 4.1.[23]?

        In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
to be undefined when building some X11 clients:
        _get_wmShellWidgetClass
        _get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using
                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92]

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93]
        contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z

you should be able to find it for about $160 a copy.

Due it seems to Sun's crapulous organisation of the X libraries and includes,
most standard (GNU and other) software won't compile out of the box (well, tar
file). 

Right now I'm trying to make ghostview. It complains it can't find X11/XaW/...
so I just linked (ln -s) the files from /usr/openwin/share/include/X11 and 
now the ghoddam thing _still_ complains it can't find them.

I still haven't been able to compile xdvi, not no way.

Has anyone _ever_ managed to get _anything_ normal to compile on a Sun
(SunOS 4.1.3 and OpenWindows 3)? What's the trick I'm missing? I've even 
tried hard copying all the relevant files into the ""right"" places and
every time, there's some bit missing or it refuses to find it.

Subject: Help with porting screensaver function
Organization: Center for Computer Music Research and Composition, U.C.S.B.
Lines: 49

This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:



I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new
server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through
debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,
which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.

My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even
after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am
I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic
design of my function from the existing versions:

static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on)
ScreenPtr scr;
Bool on;
{

  /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */
  if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {
		nextSetLastEventTime();
  }

  if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */
		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */
  }
  else {											 /* Unblank the screen */
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);
  }

  return TRUE;
}

I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
saver, but I cannot find where it ""wakes up"" the server and unblanks the
screen.

Any tips/help would be appreciated.

Thanks.

I don't know if there's a corresponding patch for Solaris 2.1, but this
sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 100492-06, the
Solaris 1.x olwm Jumbo patch:

	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab

Actually, I suspect that the OW 3.1 problem may be different, since the
README file says that this patch is just a SunOS 4.x version of the OW 3.1
olwm (but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and
they forgot to take it out in the -06 version).

   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering

I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the ""user"" window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the ""user"" window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

I understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:

                       callbacks and actions

The problem I face now is that I have a quite long piece of application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window. I want to connect this to a
widget. No problem so far. I could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.

But because the drawing takes some while, I want the application code sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events. Then I want to handle the events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted.
It seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can I give the user the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?

Has anybody an idea?

Please answer via e-mail.

The server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous, though (see also DESQview/X,

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple ""open-draw-quit"" client.  

As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the ""window_redraw()"" (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending
on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

Subject: XView slider

NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert <xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu>

Hi netters,

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and return value 0.

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem?

Any help is very much appreciated.

Yuri

Hi all,

I've read the FAQ, I've fiddled around, but I am still having problems getting
my poor old HP9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  I have 
the following in my .Xdefaults:

XTerm*Font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1

So I believe that I have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  I have NOT
set my LC_CTYPE environment variable because whatever I put it, it tells me that
that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,
or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  I can get some of the characters
above 127 to print out, but they are not where I'd expect them -- for example,
Alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  This leads me to believe that the fault
lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:

speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^H; kill = ^K; swtch = ^@
eof = ^D; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^S; start = ^Q

It really bums me out that xv went shareware.

                       What does this mean anyway?  Can I sit in a company

Now since universities are institutions (right?), doesn't this mean that
most everyone in the world is affected by this?  (I don't believe there
are that many running X windows at home yet, relatively speaking).

Can the author legally sell xv?  Xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed
by others.  Did the author get permission to sell these works?  Did
the author also get permission from all the people who contributed to
xv to sell their work as well?

My guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product,
and support for xv will begin to slide downhill.

If this is the case, then that's a bummer.  I really liked xv.

Have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
something other than 0 and 1?  The WhitePixel and BlackPixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.

Are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  You could
have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
might all be the same value?

If you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
don't use ClipMasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill.  Many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


Actually, I must also ask the FAQ's #1 most popular reason why graphics
don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle?

I think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. Gouroud-shading of triangles. This is fairly complex to do with plain
X. Simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable
'vanilla X' way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(),
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

To speak about POVRay, the X previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and
ICCCM compliance. Have a look on x256q, my own preview code. It is on

141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/

The README states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
POVRay 1.0

Hello,

I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture
machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
terminal emulator program).

The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely
spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the 
rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the 
rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
characters.

If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to
find it, it would be much appreciated.

Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.

 I have just finished building X11R5 on a 386 running Interactive Unix (SysVR3)
and I am having a problem with xterm.  On any font larger that 5x7 it messes up
characters that are types, the cursor seems to be ""too"" large, or splits into
a 1/2 reverse video, 1/2 outline block (which changes when the pointer is moved
into the window).  I am trying to use monospaced fonts (not -p- fonts).  Is
there any way of changing the appearence of the block cursor is an Xterm?

 Thanks

I've just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box
running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It's pretty much working, but
I'm encountering a weird error.  I'm attempting to start an xterm from
my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file
using 'exec 2>$HOME/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:

  ""xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner""

Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line,
it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm),
and a clock, from my .xsession also works.

Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?

I have done this before, but I'm not sure I used the best approach (although
I tried several methods...).

You have to run up the window heirarchy (using XQueryTree()) until you get
to the root window.  Now, this is not so simple because some window managers
slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,
so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.

Calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using
XGetGeometry().  BE SURE TO TAKE THE BORDER_WIDTH INTO CONSIDERATION.
Remember a windows border_width IS ON THE OUTSIDE of a window, so the
windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.

All of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the
window-manager is using.

Now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate 
where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on
the OUTSIDE of where you place your window (if I remember correctly).

DISCLAIMER: All of this is from memory, and I no longer have the code.  But
I did get it working under several window managers correctly.  Feel free to
call or e-mail for further info.

As applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  ""multi-headed""
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
a Sun with a cg4 display).  ""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would,
if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
""multi-screen"" would: a system that provides multiple Screens.

""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at
most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays
on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can
be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
inherent to X.

What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing
about X.

	Yes, it is.  It is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably

	In response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4.  The binaries available are
for the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most

It is actually worse than you think.  I have the same problem, and have
given up.  Emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what
keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  I use a Sun
from my HP, and cannot get 'shift PageUp' to work - xmodmap is not
sufficient, or at least I haven't worked out how to make it work.
However, I CAN get ordinary 'PageUp' and 'shift CursorRight' to work,
and I do some customised things with them.

Note that the Emacs on my HP has no problem, and I am using exactly
the same xmodmap and Emacs configuration.

Subject: ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events -> multiple clients
Reply-To: dus@dusws1.ctd.ornl.gov (Steinert D A)

Lines: 14

How can I capture ButtonPress/ButtonRelease events in multiple clients?
I want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen.
I can get  KeyPress/KeyRelease and Pointer motion events, but if the user
is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move)
I can't capture the events.  

The O'Reilly Xlib Programming Manual (vol. 1) says on page 252;
   ""Only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, 
    due to the grab that automatically takes place.""  

Any help would be appreciated.

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for
*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply
type ""make"" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:

	#include ""TeX.tmpl""
	PaperFormatA4()
	SimpleLatexTarget(document)

The generated Makefile provides the following commands:

    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    \input{somefile}

    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file

    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen

    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps:    Display it

    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you,
b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   (however, the German version is completed and included),

then you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.

Extract from the color README file for Anthony's Icon Library.
For Network discussion...

Color Coordination...

    I tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
  year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
  (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
  one responded at all.

    The problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly
  you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself
  solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
  of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
  ``Color needful applications'' such as :  Picture and graphic displayers,
  Animation, Real Time video, Raytracers, etc... .

    The following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.
  Icons, Window Managers, and general applications, should follow this
  table or something like it, UNLESS the application is ``color needful''.

     * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors
             EG: values   0, 128 and 255.
       This results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the
       standard colors for use in icons.

     * two extra shades of grey
             EG: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)

     * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading
       a and 3-D look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

    This table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
  posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
  workstation.

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
        PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask |
        EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
        PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.
 
If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

A completely revamped version of the X11 browser interface to Archie,
Xarchie, is now available as
	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.Z

For those not familar with Archie or Xarchie, I include part of the
manpage intro:

  Xarchie is an X11 browser interface to the Archie Internet information
  system using the Prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  Archie
  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the
  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp
  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows
  you to retrieve files located this way.

Xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of
other flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the
new features (from the README) follows:

  * Major improvements include:
    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new
      features (FWF MultiList widget).
    - Ability to expand directories in browser.
    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.
    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.
    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable
      pseudo-weights.
    - Online help browser.
    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.
    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.
    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.

There are several products you might investigate.  If you've got
$20,000 per seat and high-end hardware, Gain Momentum might be a good
choice.  It isn't compatible with HyperCard, but has a similar
architecture (and *way* more functionality).  I don't have contact
information, but they were recently purchased by Sybase who shouldn't
be too hard to find.

If you're running News on SPARC, check out HyperLook
(hyperlook@turing.com).  It uses Postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,
but not so good for non-programmers.  It was $995, last I heard.

You might also look at our product MetaCard.  We're alpha-testing
direct importing of HyperCard stacks (we've even made the test release
available for anonymous FTP), so we're obviously the closest in
functionality.  MetaCard runs on most UNIX workstations and costs
$495.  Email to info@metacard.com for more details.

Standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers
would make them available. This doesn't mean that every window manager
author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and
implemented this at top priority.

The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at
startup. It doesn't wait for window managers to do it.

Does your hardware have only one CLUT? Since standard colormaps
typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid
displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one
CLUT.

I don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible
colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather,
colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the
same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a
full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever it's
called under X11R5).

If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default
colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into
that colormap. If you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one
hw CLUT framebuffer.

Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your
client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window
managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?

Hello,

This is my first net letter, so forgive mistakes!

I have been plagued by problems (or lack of info) with
authorization in Open Windows 3.0 for a long while and
would like some help please!  I generally use strait
MIT X, and so don't use OW much, but when I share 
X software with others - bad news.

PROBLEM:

My friend who logs into his SSII trys to run my 
program that runs fine on my machine, however, 
my friend gets ""client not authorized to connect 
to server"" (or something close).  If OW is started
with the -noauth option all is well, but surely this
is not required in general!

Also, xhost + does not work, becoming root does not 
work, etc... 

Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thanx

I posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me.

The problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when I create 
detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until 
main_win.win receives an event. Here are the relevent calls:

main_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                main_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
main_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
XMapSubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
The event mask for main_win is:
	PPosition | PSize | StructureNotifyMask | ExposureMask| KeyPressMask | 
	EnterWindowMask | LeaveWindowMask;
The flags are
	PPosition | PSize

I then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
detail_win.win = XCreateSimpleWindow (mydisplay, DefaultRootWindow(mydisplay),
                myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
XSetStandardProperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                detail_win.text, None, argv, argc, &myhint);
detail_win.gc = XCreateGC (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
XMapRaised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
Event Mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.


If anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win 
are not received until main_win.win receives an event I'd love to hear 
from them. Other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail I'm overseeing.

Thanks for any tips

Greetings.

I am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively
create/edit/view a visual ""model"" (i.e. topology) of their network, and
I was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task.

In the past I have used Visual Edge's UIM/X product to develop other
GUIs, so I am familiar with UIMSs in general.

The topology will support objects and connecting links.  Once the
topology is created, I want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping, zooming, etc.

I am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than X drawing
routines to accomplish this.  Specifically, the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if I have
to ""roll my own"".

Suggestions?

Organization: The Internet
Lines: 89
Reply-To: J.K.Wight@newcastle.ac.uk
NNTP-Posting-Host: enterpoop.mit.edu
To: xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

Can anyone give me some information, please ...

I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX
platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,
or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?
""Motif"" includes Xt in this context.

One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
yet have the spec)?

Answers appreciated,

Nicholas.

I think your performance will depend upon the X server. 

I'm running Linux and XFree86 on a 33Mhz 486DX with 4MB of RAM (8MB swap) and
it runs just fine.  Its a lot better than some of the crappy old Xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.

You could probably outfit a 386SX with a minimal Linux/X setup for $900
and be better off than with an Xterminal. IMHO.

backgroundPixmap ressource. As Login is derived from Core, this should be
possible. Anyway, setting xlogin*backgroundPixmap:/a/b/c.xpm did not
produce any message of the form 'cannot convert String to Pixmap' and
explicitely registering such converter lead to nothing, too.

Any way to do it ?

Subject: Expose/Configure event handling (R4 vs R5)
Organization: UMIACS, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742
Lines: 29

I have two questions (well probably more...) about how Expose & Configure
events are handled.

I have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  Since I give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events.
The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event
calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct)
to draw the data.

Quest 1.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.)
I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed.  I assume I'm getting cascading events.  Is that right?
Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?

Quest 2.
When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events
whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

Thanks in advance

frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an IPX using the
server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! And
VERY smooth. I think I've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
on this group!) However, I may have colormap questions later.....

Summary: Clipping of character's high order bit
Nntp-Posting-Host: hsi86.hsi.com
Organization: 3M Health Information Systems, Wallingford CT
Lines: 38

I am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being 
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. I have reprogrammed
the F1 key to transmit a <ff> <be> character sequence by using the
following line in .Xdefaults:

~Ctrl ~Shift ~Alt <Key> F1 : string(0xff) string(0xbe) \n\

I merge in this line with xrdb -merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped F1 key. The problem that arises is that the 
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a <7f> <3e>
sequence, which is <ff> <be> with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored.

When I run xev and press the F1 key, I get the correct value showing 
up in the following two key events:

  KeyPress event, serial 14, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815294, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  """"

  KeyRelease event, serial 16, synthetic NO, window 0x2800001,
  root 0x28, subw 0x0, time 2067815406, (67,80), root:(74,104),
  state 0x0, keycode 16 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
  XLookupString gives 0 characters:  """"

Notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct; 0xffbe.
But when I use the F1 key while in vi or in a program I wrote to 
spit back the hex values of keyboard input, I only get <7f> <3e>.

Does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
I can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
the final application? Any help is greatly appreciated.

Please *email* any responses.

Subject: Available memory to the Xserver. How to get the actual size?
Organization: Zentrum fuer Graphische Datenverarbeitung, Darmstadt, FRG
Lines: 25

Hello Everybody!

I have a little question:

Due to more features (PEX, Drag&Drop) many applications when linked with for
example Motif 1.2 instead Motif 1.1 need more memory in the Xserver.
X-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). So my
question:

Is there a possibility to determine via X protocol calls the size of free
memory available to the Xserver?

So one can determine for example whether to start a PEX application with the
CSS on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).

Please reply via e-mail, I'll summarize!

Sincerly,
        Matthias

The patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef SVR4'' rather than the
overly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(SYSV)'' in order to
generically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture.  Also, rand and srand
don't work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results.
Otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box
with XFree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  I just uncommented the gcc definition in
the Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS
line and modified LIBS to include -lsocket -lnsl.  Really John, if you
just use the Imakefile things like this don't even have to get

I received similar information/advice about what appears to be the same problem 
Benjamin has (and I still have).
NIS has all the information about the Macs
(I even put explicit entries in /etc/hosts to no avail).
Monitoring with 'snoop' on my Classic, the initial REXEC packet is sent to
the the SUN, which sends something to the correct Mac, but nothing appears
at the Mac.
'rexecd' is number one suspect, but it's more suble than the README suggests and
I haven't yet looked into it further.

comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then

An 'X -indirect <machine>' works very well!
The configuration:

		- starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified
		   in Xservers
		- starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost

	     ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in

			'*	CHOOSER <machine1> <machine2> ... BROADCAST	
		- the number of users on this machines and the load is 
		    displayed correct

		- selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server
		   starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu
		   appears again.

I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5

Please help

Almost all window managers (twm, mwm, olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. For your purpose put following into your
.login (if you're using csh or tcsh), for sh you have to modify it.

if ( ""$term"" == ""xterm"" ) then
	echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}^G^[]1;${HOST}^G""
endif

Note, ^[ stands for <Esc>, in vi you can enter it by pressing
Ctrl-V and the <Esc>. Same for ^G, it means Ctrl-G. In vi:
press Ctrl-V and then Ctrl-G.
The first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

BTW, you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd:

alias cd 'cd \!* ; echo ""^[]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}: ${cwd}^G""'

greetings,
Thomas

1. You need these resources :
	XTerm*EightBitInput:    true
	XTerm*EightBitOutput:    true

2. In the shell you need to do : 
        stty cs8 -istrip

Batten down the hatches, hide the women, and lock up the cows, XV 3.00 has

me, broke down the office door, and fled the lab.  It was last seen heading

	I've done this fine, but I've turned up the following problem:

The simple answer is for you to obtain use XView to do this.  XView is a
one to one replacement for Sunview.  It should already be provided with
you Sun running OpenWindows.   It is also free available as part of the

The problem was that TextField was improperly walking the string; it used
the character count instead of the byte count... a significan ""Oops"". 
The problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic

** I am posting this for a friend **
** please respond to vaughn%sonatech@hub.ucsb.edu **

I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern 
and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern 
of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width 
is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the 
pattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even 
multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels 
apart.


extern	Display	       *dpy;
extern	Window		xid;
extern	GC		gc;

extern	int	Max_X, Max_Y;		/* set in resize handler	*/

dither(pixels)

	char	*pixels;		/* dither pattern data		*/

	{
	char	*bm;			/* bitmap data			*/
	char    *bmp;
	long	 I, arraymax;


	arraymax = Max_X*Max_Y;

	bm  = (char *)malloc(arraymax);
	bmp = bm;

	for (I=j=0; I<arraymax; I++)
		{
		if (pixels[I] & DITHER_BIT)
			*bmp |=   2<<j;		/* pixel on		*/
		else
			*bmp &= ~(2<<j);	/* pixel off		*/

		if (++j > 7)
			{
			bmp++;
			j = 0;
			}
		}

	stipple = XCreateBitmapFromData(dpy, xid, bm, Max_X, Max_Y);
	free(bm);

	XClearWindow(dpy, xid);

	XSetStipple(dpy, gc, stipple);
	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillStippled);
	XFillRectangle(dpy, xid, gc, 0, 0, Max_X, Max_Y);
	XSetFillStyle(dpy, gc, FillSolid);
	}

I suspect the answer is to pad the data.

I'm writing an application running under X (using Motif), and I need to do
some stuff when the application quits.  Now, when I shut down my X Windows
session, it doesn't seem to send a SIGTERM (or whatever) signal to my
application (I'm trapping various signals like that).  Therefore, I thought
I could use an X signal to check for my top level window being destroyed.

However I seem to get DestroyNotify events whenever I move windows.  Is
there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed
(some field to check or some combination of events?).

Replies by e-mail please and I will summarise.

Thanks for any help,
                      Ian

I've built xcoral on my system (SunOS 4.1.3, X11R5, Motif 1.2, OW 3.0)
and it builds fine, but when I run it, any child windows that xcoral
opens,
1) locks the mouse into the window area
2) doesn't accept any input from the mouse.

Needless to say, this is a pain in the ass, as I have to go find an
empty terminal to login and kill xcoral.

Is this a problem with OpenWindows or Motif?  Is there a patch?

May I humbly suggest DESQview/X? (Of course, I'm biased...)

DESQview/X is a multitasker for DOS computers, that uses a standard
X11R4 server as it's display mechanism. DOS applications and Microsoft
Windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to X-protocol, allowing
you to display them, or any R4 compatable X-program from any machine
on the net to display to the PC's local display (or to any other display
on the net).

Free tools are available for devloping X-applications for the DVX platform;
many X-programs have been ported between DVX and UNIX with little or
no modifications. (Often, you only need to create a new makefile!)

If you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group
comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com,
and I'd be happy to fill you in.

Does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  Or does
the server generate a software cursor.  You can generally tell the difference
just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,
it's probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think you're
probably battling a bug in HP's X server.  I'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  It's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just 
that.

In reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns.

Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.

Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended
PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on
my Sparc and PC with only one hitch. 
The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. 
On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows
installation.


The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory
had the line
DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY

s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console.
By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

`hostname`:1.0

Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru
a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.
My PC is a 486-DX2 ATI Ultra, 16 MB

Bitmap Stuff Sucked.
Basic Editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
Xmail was very usable.

At times the first time U typed in an Xclient window there was
a very noticable delay, I put this down to brain damaged ""WINDOWS
should not be called a SCHEDULER"", besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while.

Has anybody tried the NON Windows version of the product, the sales
person said they performed about the same, given the over head of
WINDOWS I question this?

many thanks for help to all who responded

I created a pixmap or drawable window, then used XDrawLine() function 
drawed a line as below fingure:

		width = 300
	================================

	|===============================| \

	I created the pixmap or drawable window only with size 300x300.
But I draw line from p1(x1=270,y1=100) to p2(x2=500,y2=800).
My question is, dose the XDrawLine function can finger out that correct
p3(x3 and y3) for me? If you calculate x3 and y3. 

x3 = 300;

@ = art tan (( 800 - 100)/(500 - 270)) = 71.81 degrees;

y3 = 100 + x3/tan(@) = 100 + 300/tan(71.81) = 198.58 ~= (integer) 199.

How do I prove XDrawLine() give me the right x3, y3 or not?
Please don't ask me why I don't created a 900x900 pixmap. No, I don't
wan to. 

Thanks in advance!

In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and
any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it
supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary
scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but
you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.

Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told
that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with
both color and monochrome X.

  More RAM, Faster CPU's, More disk space, Faster Ethernet...  These
  are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
  performance of your workstation.

  Well, more hardware isn't always an option, and I wonder if more
  hardware is always even a necessity.

  This ""FAQ"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
  people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X
  Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.

  Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must
  balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
  decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
  subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

  This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course
  many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
  However, they are outside the scope of this document.

    [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system
    performance, might want to look at the O'Reilly Nutshell Handbook
    ""System Performance Tuning"" by Mike Loukides.  I'm about 25% of the
    way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written
    comprehensive treatment of system performance.  I'm unaware of any
    other similar books.  --ed.]

Introduction & Administrivia
-----------------------------

  This document is posted each month, on or around the 15th, to the
  Usenet news groups comp.windows.x, news.answers, and comp.answers.
  If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few
  months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably
  locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

  If you do not know how to get those newsgroups and/or your site does
  not receive them and/or this article has already expired, you can
  retrieve this FAQ from an archive site.

  There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.  To find out more about
  them and how to access them, please see the ""Introduction to the
  news.answers newsgroup"" posting in news.answers.

  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].  This document
  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.  If
  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by

-----------------------------
What about the ""Other X FAQ""?
-----------------------------

  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
  well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.
  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates
  on performance.

  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with
  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:
	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".
  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).

---------------
Window Managers
---------------

  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different
  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a
  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this
  point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate
  for a speedy window manager. 

  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,
  is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".
  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the
  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:
  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is
  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)
  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the
  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.

------------
The X Server
------------

Which Server?
- - - - - - -
  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.

  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between
  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to
  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
  to less paging.  
         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),
                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]

  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law
  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be
  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
  You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not
  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results
  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial
  compilers on the market.

Locking the Server into RAM?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and
  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help
  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few
  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone
  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.

Starting your Server
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep
    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my
    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...
    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.

  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  

  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of
  why this works, which I have summarized here:

    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to
    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by
    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of
    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the
    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you
    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself
    sorted out before the clients start up.

    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X
    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources
    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so
    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this
    initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),
    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
    workstation's limited resources

  This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there
  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap
  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients
  you are starting, etc.

  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

  I've experimented with:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &

  I've even tried:
	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &
  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:
	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &
	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &

    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down
    into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients
    were launched. ]

  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with
  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to
  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

Fonts
- - -
  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts
  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.

  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one
  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or
  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.
  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer
  fonts will be loaded by the server.
			      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),
			        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]

  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13
  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since
  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.

  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):
    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.
    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.

About the Resources File
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves
    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)

  One suggestion:

    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum
    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true

    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific
    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your
    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:

	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N

    [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains
    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
    --ed.]

    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from
    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,
    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same
    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system
    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to
    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files
    with the same name.

    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
		    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),
		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),
		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]

  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following
  benefits:

    - Easier to maintain / more usable.

    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally
      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort 
      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

  It also has drawbacks:

    - the application that you are interested in has to load an
      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to
      make that much of a performance difference, and you might
      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an
      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the
      application without having to ""xrdb"" again.

    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When
      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.
      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!

      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped
      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource
      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*
      provide any error message when it encountered the C style
      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted
      processing the resource file.

      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef
      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
      method of resource management.

    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For
      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their
      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.

    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client
      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the
      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)
  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my
  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for
  clients that I seldom use.

Define Your Display Properly
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In
  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to 
  ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you
  should set your DISPLAY variable to ""unix:0.0"" or "":0.0"".  By doing this
  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
			[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]

  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further
  explanation of how to properly set your display name.

  ""I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have
  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.""
			      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)

  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change
  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.
  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT
  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if
  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]

-------
Clients
-------

  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think
  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also
  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there
  a smaller clock program than xclock?

  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large
  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]

  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject
  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are
  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather
  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using
  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In
  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually
  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.

  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try
  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif
  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in
  more than one toolkit library.

  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client
  programs would work best together in that environment.

A Better Clock for X
- - - - - - - - - - -

1) xcuckoo
   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu

   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.
   Saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar

   Non Xt-based.  Extensively configurable.  it can be made to look
   very much like MIT oclock, or mostly like xclock purely by changing
   resources.

  Of course, the ultimate clock --- one that consumes no resources, and 
  takes up no screen real estate --- is the one that hangs on your wall.

A Better Terminal Emulator for X
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  From the README file distributed with xterm:

  +-----
  |		 Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
  |
  | This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
  | ...
  +-----

  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.  I suspect that
  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
  Laziness?  Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?  See below.

  If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines
  to reduce memory usage.  [ Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com),
		   Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ]

1) Xvt
   suggested by: Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) :
   available: export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xvt-1.0.tar.Z

   ""...if you don't need all the esoteric features of xterm, then get
   hold of xvt ...  it was written here just to save swap space as
   xterm is rather a hog! ""

   This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.  You don't have to
   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current
   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that
   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any
   yet.

   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with
   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He
   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For
   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling
   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap
   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm
   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard
   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text
   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.

   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it
   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets
   brought into memory.

   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,
   relative speed of each

2) mterm
   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)
   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

   ""I also have my own terminal emulator.  Its major lack is
   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.""


Tuning your client
- - - - - - - - - -

  Suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

  From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif
  Text Field Widgets:

    I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I
    was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,
    particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was
    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource
    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget
    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.
    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the
    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user
    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not
    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference
    on a [slower system].

  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor
  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server
  requests?

-------------------------
Miscellaneous Suggestions
-------------------------

Pretty Pictures
- - - - - - - -
  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.

  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server
    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)

  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm
    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see
    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.

    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by
    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate
    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

A Quicker Mouse
- - - - - - - -
  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
  when you move your mouse.  I use ""xset m 3 10"" in my .xinitrc file,
  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.

  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for
  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different
  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  

  e.g. (for twm) :
      menu ""mouse settings"" {
        ""Mouse Settings:""			f.title
	""  Very Fast""				! ""xset m 7 10 &""
	""  Normal (Fast)""			! ""xset m 3 10 &""
	""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)""	! ""xset m default &""
	""  Glacial""				! ""xset m 0 10 &""
      }

Programming Thoughts
- - - - - - - - - - -
  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :
    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of
    things you can do.  Some that stick out:

    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual
      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or
      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager
      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.

    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.

    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.
      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)

    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE
      difference.

    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the
      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
      one.

  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :
    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc
    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based
    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying
    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some
    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the
    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]

  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :

  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.

    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but
    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the
    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most
    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
    run through it's event-loop again and again.

  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.

    This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,
    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed
    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching
    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will
    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the
    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Say What!?
- - - - - - 
  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:

  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :
    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs
    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your
    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the
    same operation between client and server.

  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received
  the following confirmation...

  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):
    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big
    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage
    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This
    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was
    essential when I only had 8 MB.

  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :
    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as
    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a
    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in
    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :
    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's
    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate
    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they
    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your
    action.

    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2
    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going
    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved
    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing
    even fewer context switches.

----------------------------
Other Sources of Information
----------------------------

  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System
  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.

  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):
    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper ""Improving X
    Application Performance"" by Chris D. Peterson and Sharon Chang, in
    Issue 3 of The X Resource.

    An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Xhibition 1992
    conference proceedings.

    This paper is absolutely essential reading for X programmers.

Subject: 121)  Are callbacks guaranteed to be called in the order registered?

	Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xt
happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, 
the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental 
authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order is
undefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and
the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.
	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating 
independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other
callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be 
registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.

Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?

	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving
dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not 
actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?
	
	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,
which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer
is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code drops
out of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: 

	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)
	{
		int             answer;
		answer = AskUser(w, ""Really Quit?"");
		if (RET_YES == answer)
			{
			answer = AskUser(w, ""Are You Really Positive?"");
			if (RET_YES == answer)
				exit(0);
                }
	}

	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether 
to overwrite it.
	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the
calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the 
Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of 
dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""OK"", ""Cancel"" and 
""Help"" or equivalents:

  int AskUser(w, string)
        Widget          w;
        char           *string;
  {
        int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */
        Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/
        Arg             args[3];
        int             n = 0;
        XtAppContext    context;

        n=0;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,
                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;
        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;
        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);
        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);
        XtManageChild(dialog);

        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);
        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {
                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);
        }
        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */
        return answer;
  }

	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same 
function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user 
finally selects one of those choices:

  void response(w, client, call)
        Widget          w;
        XtPointer client;
        XtPointer call;
  {
  int *answer = (int *) client;
  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;
        switch (reason->reason) {
        case XmCR_OK:
                *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */
                break;
        case XmCR_CANCEL:
                *answer = RET_NO; 
		break;
        case XmCR_HELP:
                *answer = RET_HELP;
                break;
        default:
                return;
        }
}

and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and
continues from there.

Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?
I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.

	Users of R4 and later are best off using the XtName() function, which 
will work on both widgets and non-widget objects.

	If you are still using R3, you can use this simple bit of code to do 
what you want. Note that it depends on the widget's internal data structures 
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of Xt, including R4.

	#include <X11/CoreP.h>
	#include <X11/Xresource.h>
	String XtName (widget)
	Widget widget;	/* WILL work with non-widget objects */
	{
	return XrmNameToString(widget->core.xrm_name);
	}

Subject: 125)  Why do I get a BadDrawable error drawing to XtWindow(widget)?
I'm doing this in order to get a window into which I can do Xlib graphics
within my Xt-based program:

> canvas = XtCreateManagedWidget ( ...,widgetClass,...) /* drawing area */
> ...
> window = XtWindow(canvas);	/* get the window associated with the widget */
> ...
> XDrawLine (...,window,...);	/* produces error */

	The window associated with the widget is created as a part of the 
realization of the widget.  Using a window id of NULL (""no window"") could 
create the error that you describe.  It is necessary to call XtRealizeWidget() 
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget. 
	Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, 
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also 
wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?

The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of 
the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can take
the following steps to avoid the error:

1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.
2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.
3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.
4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab the
image from the pixmap.
5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and 
the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you 
the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.
6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?

	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straight
character-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:
	
	display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);
	if (display)
		{ do X stuff }
	else
		{ do curses or something else }
where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following
-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case 
XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].

This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line 
argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is 
adequate. [5/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 128)  How do I make a ""busy cursor"" while my application is computing?
Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?

	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is 
as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel 
window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other 
application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the 
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual 
desktop.) Substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code 
should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):

     unsigned long valuemask;
     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;

     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */
     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;
     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |
         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);
     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);

     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by
        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */
     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,
         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,
         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);

where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,
particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than
32767.

When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to
normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.

In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor 
resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events.

Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?

	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which 
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its 
children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X 
connection to the display. 
	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, 
		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));
to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your 
exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.
	Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file 
descriptor to be closed on exec.
		(void) fcntl(ConnectionNumber(XDisplay), F_SETFD, 1);

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 130)  Can I make Xt or Xlib calls from a signal handler?

	No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical 
sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which 
might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave
the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points
out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to
Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by 
Xlib or Xt functions.
	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt
handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which
has previously been added.

	Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly 
Volume 6 are in error.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 131)  What are these ""Xlib sequence lost"" errors?

	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error 
handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or 
Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?

	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input 
both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but 
which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or 
the other file descriptor.
	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,
use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be 
called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your 
program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt 
callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only
non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.
	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an 
input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.
	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.
You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.
XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is 
called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is
new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always 
ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning
and read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almost
always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the 
type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your 
function to test whether there is new data:
	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;
But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a 
busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting 
a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?

	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not setting
the window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event.
	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use 
XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you
avoid a round-trip to the server.
	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.

Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?

> ...

>      root_window,size_hints.x,size_hints.y,
>      size_hints.width,size_hints.height,BORDER_WIDTH,

> XMapWindow(the_display,the_window);
> ...
> XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
> ...

	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the 
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --
until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will 
generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code 
would appear after window was created and mapped:
  while (!done)
    {
      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);
      switch (the_event.type) {
	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */
		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);
		break;
	...
	}
    }

	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't 
set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background 
colors, so this program could previously include this code:
  ...
  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */
  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,
                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);
  ...
 
Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is 
black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 
and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be 
reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.

Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong 
thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for 
foreground and background.

And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based program
if you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it may
not yet have appeared.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?

	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A 
server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,
unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --
the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available 
Screens on this particular Display connection.
	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one
which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.
	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine 
the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.
	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the Screen have ""Display"" in the names -- 
XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)

Subject: 138)  Can XGetWindowAttributes get a window's background pixel/pixmap?

	No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be 
re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,
set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The 
window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're 
sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() 
to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read 
back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and 
it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD 
and Stuart Marks of Sun]

	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a 
(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the 
original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

Subject: 139)  How do I create a transparent window?
	
	A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnly
window. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you have
several choices:
	- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way to
make non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit the
areas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers 
support the extension.
	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows for
particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note 
that there is no X notion of a ""transparent color index"".
	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny 
windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.
	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent
window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application
window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors
that will appear properly.

Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?

	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing
operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black
and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break.]
	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be 
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
pre-computed values.
	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you 
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics 
context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over 
red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. 
This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and 
blue.

Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?

	Make sure you're using 16 bits and not 8.  The red, green, and blue 
fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is 
full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color) 
the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is 
usually black.

Subject: 142)  Why can't my program get a standard colormap?
I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the 
standard colormap, but it doesn't work. 

	XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does 
not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists.
Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

Subject: 143)  Why does the pixmap I copy to the screen show up as garbage? 

	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there 
-- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using
XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever 
color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a 
mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

Subject: 144)  How do I check whether a window ID is valid?
My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it.

	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window 
would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the
event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow 
errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will
work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed 
and its ID reallocated to another window.

[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?

	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,
the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that 
knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except
for GCs and private color cells, can be shared].
	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple 
applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to 
create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into
it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also
knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.
	[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]
	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level 
cooperation among your applications. 
	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to 
use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it 
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

Subject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?

	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return 
the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):

/* Function Name: GetVRoot
 * Description: Gets the root window, even if it's a virtual root
 * Arguments: the display and the screen
 * Returns: the root window for the client
 */
#include <X11/Xatom.h>
Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr)
Display        *dpy;
int             scr;
{
Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children;
unsigned int    numChildren;
Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr);
Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None;
int             i;

  __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, ""__SWM_VROOT"", False);
  XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);
  for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) {
	Atom            actual_type;
	int             actual_format;
	long            nitems, bytesafter;
	Window         *newRoot = NULL;

	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1,
	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,
            &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) {
			root = *newRoot;
			break;
		}
	}

	return root;
}

Subject: 147)  How do I keep a window from being resized by the user?

	Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but 
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting 
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best. 
[1/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 148)  How do I keep a window in the foreground at all times?

	It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself
[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- 
imagine the conflict between two such programs running.  
	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack
is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily
assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do 
this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup 
menus or other short parameter-setting windows).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?

	There is no easy way.  Unless you're willing to depend on some sort of
extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself,
either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games
with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.

Subject: 150)+ How do I get a double-click in Xlib?

	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help 
get notification of double-clicking.
	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the 
protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do 
client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you 
have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish 
implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of 
the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.
	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click
be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise
check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should
be the single-click action or the double-click action.

Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?
	
	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics 
capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics
libraries.
	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to
render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it ""by 
hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via 
XPutImage(); more specifically:
	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.
	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).
	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.
	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where 
		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)
		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)
	5) render I2
	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.
	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X 
also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer.
	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph.

(etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;

	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support for
rendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code.
[Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91]
	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are 
stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine 
requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91]

	The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) 
(posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing 
the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font.
	The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a 
set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 
was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also 
on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z. 

	O'Reilly's X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about
modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 152)  What is the X Registry? (How do I reserve names?)

	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X
protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things.
	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:
orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,
application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.
	The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 
tape; it is also available by sending ""send docs registry"" to the xstuff mail
server.
	To register names (first come, first served) or to ask questions send 
to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu; be sure to include a postal address for
confirmation.

Subject: Button sensitivity problem: MOTIF app under OpenWindows
Nntp-Posting-Host: nscultrix2.network.com
Organization: Network Systems Corporation
Lines: 25

The MOTIF application consists of multiple Transient shells as children 
of a single TopLevel shell:

+-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+
| AppShell  |---| TopLevelShell |---| TransientShell |
+-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+
                                  |
                                  | +----------------+
                                  |-| TransientShell |
                                  | +----------------+
                                  |

While a Transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the 
sensitivity of a button in the TopLevel shell which is hidden by the 
Transient shell window.  When the Transient shell is popped-down, the 
button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 
(i.e., solid/shaded).  Subsequent selection of the button causes the 
text to revert to the correct visual state.

When tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events 
seen under mwm are not present under OpenWindows.

If anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail.
  Thanks!

It is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
to be DSC compliant.  That is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
right hand is doing at Sun.  I was informed by a Sun employee that the pageview
program does require DSC compliant PostScript.  There was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't DSC compliant that it
would stop at each showpage.  I believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go
forward to the next showpage.  This isn't in OW3.0 pageview, but maybe it is
in the Solaris 2.x version of OW (OW 3.1?).

In any event, I find pageview extremely useful.  Since all of the PostScript
that I produce IS DSC compliant, I don't have any problems.

Most DOS X servers are terribly slow to use in my experience - and no, I guess

I tend to use XIconifyWindow to achieve this effect...  Have you tried that?

Users can't find the cursor?  Run ""xneko"" - it'll turn the cursor into a
mouse (rodent variety (-: ).  If your users still can't find it, the cat will!

  I'm running HP-UX 8.07 with HP VUE 2.01 and I need a hardcopy of
  the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to 
  include in a manual. 
  I have tried:
   xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd 

  from a login on a remote terminal, but it doesn't work. 
  Xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window
  server doesn't answer. 

  Any suggestions? I must use xwd because I don't have access to

xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in

is still achieved using XImages, but the notion of rotating a whole font

What's new?

I've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
speeding up redraws.

On a related note, how can I use xv to display colored GIFs on my
root display with HP Vue?

All I can do with Vue is display xbm's through their
Backdrop Style Manager.

xv does not seem to be able to override whatever Vue
puts there.

Hi,
I have a problem when compiled Wcl 2.02 in SCO ODT 2.0:


        cc -c -Ox  -I.. -I/usr/include Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c
Xt4GetResL.c(47) : error C2065: '_XtConstraintBit' : undefined
*** Error code 1

Although I follow the instructions in file README_BUILD to build Wcl in SCO 
platform, this problem didn't resolve.

So I have some questions related to this matter:

  1. Does _XtConstraintBit exist in SCO ODT 2.0? ( Does _XtConstraintBit use
      in X11R3 & X11R4? And What release does SCO ODT 2.0 use, X11R3 or X11R4?)
  2. If not, Does someone know how to work around?

sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu
(128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that 
machine. The distribution all includes ""mftobdf"" which converts PK, GF, and PXL
fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X
server. 
	The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is 
also available from a number of sites, including uunet and export.lcs.mit.edu;
current version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].

Subject:  87)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?

	X11R4 has two previewers for device-independent troff: the supported 
client xditview, and the contributed-but-well-maintained xtroff. An earlier 
version of xtroff also appeared on the R3 contributed source. xditview is also
in the R5 distribution.
	In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents
which use the -man macros (i.e. man pages).
	If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.

In addition:

	xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin 
Solomon (solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on export in 
contrib/xproof*. 	[8/90]

	Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified 
troff implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.

	SoftQuad (416-963-8337; USA only 800-387-2777, mail@sq.uu.net or
mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad Publishing Software, including a substantially-
rewritten troff formatter, a better intermediate language with backwards 
compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4] previewer. (This is the package adopted by 
AT&T's own MIS department, and used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T). 
[information from Ian Darwin, SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90]

	Image Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff 
package, which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of 
X11-based page previewers. (This is the package OEM'ed by several hardware 
vendors.)

Subject:  88)! Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?

	A new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works 
with X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:
  This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user
  interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates
  ""Wc - Widget Creation"" resource files and this distribution also includes the
  Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and
  Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth.
Check dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

	The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder 
called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete 
with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps 
on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).
	Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an
interactive building tool. 

	Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC 
machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but 
apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for 
which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G, Kok CH, Ngan TY, ""Druid: A System
for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development"". Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp 
on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM, NY, 1990, pp:167-177.

	The BYO interface builder is implemented in tcl.

	In addition, Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a 
window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are 
or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package 
includes an interface builder.

       In addition, the GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X 
applications using its own set of objects which are planned to have a Motif 
look.  GRAMMI is written in Ada and generates Ada specs and stub bodies. 
(1-800-GRAMMI-1).

	In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals 
of rapid prototyping of the application interface:

	WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget
hierarchy and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers
everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl provides
a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.5 is current
[3/93].
	WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit allows for interpretive 
programming. The copy on the R4 tape is outdated; get a copy off export or 
email to winterp-source%hplnpm@hplabs.hp.com. 
	The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without 
specific knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set
on a particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from 
ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is 
also available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent. Email
questions can go to serpent@sei.cmu.edu. A commercial version of Serpent is
available as ""Agora"" from ASET, 221 Woodhaven Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15228.

Subject:  89)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts?
I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user 
is running X.

	Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these
needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are
several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/ 
area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.
	In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu
package to comp.sources.x (""v08i008: xmenu"") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]

being worked on and will likely be re-released.
	xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on export's contrib/
are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions of the 
simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]
	xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such
as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a
simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from

Subject:  92)  TOPIC: BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION [topic needs updating to R5]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  93)  What's a good source of information on configuring the X build?

	This FAQ includes information on a number of ""gotchas"" that can bite 
you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on 
building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at 
the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server.
	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates's Volume 8 on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  94)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?

	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 
may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  95)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?

	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with 
libdl.a.  Add ""-ldl"" to your and eventually your site.def.  You may want to 
surround it with ""-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic"" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES
variable, since ""syslibs"" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile 
the stubs shared.)

Subject:  96)  What is this strange problem building X clients on SunOS 4.1.2?

	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X11R4 builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some X11 clients: 
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling ""-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic"" appears to work. 

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch

                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] 

A source patch for use with the MIT X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad 
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on export in [1/93]
	contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  97)  Why can't gcc compile X11R4 on my SPARC?
I used gcc to compile the whole distribution, but I get several segmentation
faults when running X.

	Note first that gcc on RISC machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase; it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or VAX platforms.

	Here is the problem: gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values, so when 
gcc-compiled parts of X are linked with Sun-supplied functions that pass or 
return structs, run-time errors occur.  Affected programs include rgb and 
the server.

	This is from the GCC manual:

	On the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for 
	structures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument
	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by 
	reference.

	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet
	supported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.

	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and
	`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.

You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation flags.  

	Files which need to be compiled using cc include:
		server/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c 
		rgb/rgb.c

	In addition, several of the ""inet_"" functions use structs as args or
return values:  
		clients/xhost/xhost.c 
		clients/xauth/gethost.c. 
Calls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly 
harmless as they don't involve structs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	""Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. 
	Fatal server bug! no screens found.""

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do 
this simple test:

	#include <sys/ioctl.h>
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are 
identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?
In mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found ""missing"" defines for 
CG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN. What should these be?

	The R4 Errata list distributed after X11R4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older SunOS versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile:
        #define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)
        #define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN
        #define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN

	However, the Sun3 should not actually ever have the CG3 device, and so 
references to it can be removed from mit/server/ddx/sun/sunInit.c and the 
Imakefile.  [11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 100)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?
The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.

	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include 
from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line 
	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 101)  What are these problems using R4 shared libraries on SunOS 4?
All of the executables that I try to run have the following results:
	ld.so: libXmu.so.4: not found
or even:
	ld.so: call to undefined procedure __GetHostname from 0xf776a96c

	If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun, remember that you 
need to run ""ldconfig"" as root after installing the shared libraries (if you've
installed X on a file-server, run it on the server's clients, too).  While 
building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid 
linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those 
distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  
If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that 
the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or 
/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked 
statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]
	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it
attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to
most C compilers).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)

This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in 
X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was 
removed in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5
libraries only applied to the documented interface).  

A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis 
(jpf@heliocentric.com)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?

	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.
	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).
	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]

The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this 
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. 
Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.

Subject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?

	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console 
display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).

Subject: 105)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 106)  What is Imake?

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not 
specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious.
	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and
R5 versions are different.

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:
	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information
	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4
guide to imake.
	- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake
	- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and 
config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. 
[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;
mail a message body of ""send imake-stuff help"" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.
	- see ""System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?"" by Dinah McNutt
in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.
	- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article ""Das Meta-Make 
/ I make, you make / Schwerelos"" by Rainer Klute in ""iX 
Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin"", directed at application programmers needing to
write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The
X Journal, issue 2:1.
	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on
demystifying Imake.
	- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in 
sasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 107)  Where can I get imake?

	Versions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier 
version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such 
configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with X11R5.
	export contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.
	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in
ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?

	If you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run ""xmkmf"". This is a 
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a 
Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, 
which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?
When I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:
	Undefined:
	_XShapeQueryExtension
	_XShapeCombineMask

	These routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)
which was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular
windows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many 
vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case 
they will display rectangular windows anyway.

	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library 
libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do 
not despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X 
libraries.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 110)  What are these problems with ""_XtInherit not found"" on the Sun?
When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the 
error ""ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit"".

	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to 
get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that 
is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting 
_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby 
guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where 
XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally
be called.

	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. 
	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a 
connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called
XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your 
program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.
	2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is
correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView 
program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. 

	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,
although this will certainly solve the problem.

Subject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?
I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under 
the current version of X, I get this message:
	Undefined:
	_XtScrollBarSetThumb
	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint
	_XtTextReplace

	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4
release notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but
are part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.
[10/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?

	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are
called ""hints"" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you
can use something like the following:

        XWMHints wmhints;
        ...
        wmhints.flags = InputHint;
        wmhints.input = True;
        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)

If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput 
resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have
source, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.

Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having 
this done. 

	If you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.
	OpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true

[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?

	You can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case. 
	For most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so 
long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in 
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can 
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may 
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order
to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window 
manager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?
	
	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the 
Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development 
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional 
development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to ""test just 
this one little thing"" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that 
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 
distributions, and the Xlib ""Hello World"" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and 
R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 
Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  
by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]

	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute 
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display 
connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?

	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:
	{
	Arg args[3];
	int i;
	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */
	i=0;
	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;
	XtGetValues(widget, args, i );
	...
	}

But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; 
declaring the variable ""sensitive"" as Boolean works properly. This problem 
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types 
Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.
[11/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?

	You're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a 
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising 
functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use 
only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.
Although this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your
application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the 
widgets' data becoming corrupted.
	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be 
avoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?

	Although there are various details of the current implementation of
the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the ""new"" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?
What should happen to the widget's children? And by the time such semantics are
defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired 
resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new widget.

	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.

 Hi Xperts!
   I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.
   previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then 
   i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in
not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.

   I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files 
required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw.
In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from
the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows
 
 BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi
 and misc. 

when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the
default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space. 
Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to
just have my x-windows running. 

Thanks

   Environment:

      OS	: SunOS 4.1.3
      X11	: X11R5 (patchlevel 22)
      Motif	: 1.2.2

I bring up X server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/X11/Xsun. The following sequence
of actions crashes the X server (SIGPIPE, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
to X server lost):

   1. xinit -- Xsun
   2. start mwm
   3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
   4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

The server dumps core due to SIGPIPE. One of the two messages is printed:

  ""Connection to X server lost""

or
  
  ""Connection broken (errno=32)""

(I believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

Next, I ran xdm in debug level = 5. After the same set of actions, xdm reports:

  select returns -1
  Server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560


Note:
 * The problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
 * I have not set LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
 * I am not running font server. 
 * If I start the client with fixed width font, I do not see this problem.
 * My font path:
     /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi

   (I did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/75dpi,
   /usr/lib/X11/fonts/PEX, /usr/lib/X11/fonts/Speedo,
   and in /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc).

 * This problem seems to occur only on IPX machines. I do not see this 
   problem on IPC workstations.

Questions:
 * What the hell is goin on ? :-)
 * What does ""status 2560"" mean (of the server).

I'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

I build two executables for the same application. 
Let's call them Papp (uses shared libs) and SPapp (statically linked).

The problem is that I get problems when trying to build the *static one*, 
but not the dynamic one. See the trace below. 

BTW, the static one runs fine despite the ominous error message. 
Can someone clue me in as to why the static one bombs at link time?

Thanks very much,

See subject. An opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).

I am looking for a commercial/PD graphics editor with fairly limited
abilities that runs under X and preferably uses Motif widgets. It must
run on HP-UX version 9, either with or without the PEX extension. The
sort of things I want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects
such as lines, rectangles and text. Bounding rectangle operations are
sufficient for object selection. Ideally it should also allow the
creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.
text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.

Does anyone have such an animal? If you do, please mail me with details
including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be
included in a product). Alternatively, send glossies to me at Logica,
68 Newman Street, London W1, including technical info please. For PD
stuff, I have some effort that could be put into porting.

Thanks for any help,

What I'd like to see is this scenario: 

Each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. 
Palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. 
They are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  Palettes are
held in the server.  A palette can accomadate, up to, the number of
hardware color cells of color descriptors. 

When the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access
to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  ALL
OTHER WIDGETS, TRANSIENTLY, GET THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION THAT CAN BE
GENERATED BY A UNION OF THE COLORS FROM THE CURRENT PALETTE AND ANY FREE
COLORS THAT ARE LEFT OVER. 

A widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)
into its associated palette. 

The bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

I wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question:

I am trying to create a simple drawing tool....

Let's say I have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) 
one intersecting the other...
Now, I would like to delete one of the rectangles.
The way I do it is to create another GC wherein I use the
GXxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
A problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is 
something that should be avoided.

Is there any way I can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too?
I also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly...


Thank you...

I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model

A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

  There's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
X11R5 distribution.

  Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using
on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they
were just about equal.

  The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesn't grow to ridiculous
sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging SHM apps).

  Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be
attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes
XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Dec's 24
bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) don't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using
pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to
use the local unix domain socket (which really isn't that bad; one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

  In short: allowing all three forms of display, within the program is a
Good Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

  (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)

Since I don't think Tom always gets time to read this group, I'll take the
liberty of responding to some of this.  If you really want Tom to reply
you should send mail to support@qdeck.com.

A 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps
ethernet that we typically run.  How restrictive it will be depends on 
what you run and how you run it.  I would think that a couple of instances
of some really nasty program like ""Smoking Clover"" would make the link 
useless for anyone else.  On the other hand, probably 50 xclocks quietly
updating every 10 seconds or so wouldn't impact it too much.  In the real
world, you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.

Going by the way I personally use X on a daily basis, I wouldn't want to have
to share that 64k link with more than 3-4 other people.

Our corporate WAN is as unique as any other.  The usage patterns are not very
good predictors of how yours will behave.  The only one of our low bandwidth
links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to Ireland that they
often use to run a DOS text based client end of a client-server database 
remotely from the DVX machine behind me. Since the server end is (or was) always
at this end (California) it is faster to remotely run the client via DESQview
X and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having
a long hop to the server.  As I warned you, this tells us very little about
how you usage pattern will fill a 64k ISDN link.

Running Word for Windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.
Let's break it into pieces and look at it.  Tracking the mouse pointer is easy
and efficient to translate from Windows calls into X. Popping up a menu is a
little more involved and will generate some traffic.  Restoring the screen
that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be.  Does the server
that it's displaying on have backing store?  If so and the server had enough
memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network
traffic. If no backing store, then what was being covered up?  If it was a 
solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite
easily.  If it was a full color backdrop of Ren & Stimpy we may have to send
it back to the X server bit by bit.  DVX will do its level best to only redraw
that small area, but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be 
repainted.  Assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits
that has to be sent.  Worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds.
In reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts 
that will be tranlatable into higher level X calls.

X was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network.  It's 
pretty good for this.  X programs are best, DOS text programs are almost
as good (since we conert them to X easily).  Something like WinX is a hybrid.
We intercept the calls Windows makes to it's graphics driver/ mouse driver
keyboard driver and convert them to X.  The calls Windows is making are in
no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network.  We go to a 
lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level Xlib calls we can, but
we are somewhat limited because we only know what Windows and its applications
tell us.

The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was
developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other
platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to
the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the
internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory
./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5"" diskette can be
ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address
below. 

The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the
same host.

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.

-----------

The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment
on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media
applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but
also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,
equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects, including text.

AUIS has three components:

    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set
    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help
    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell
    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects. 

    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented
    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system. 

    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of
    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails
    of related messages, and subscription management. It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function
    workstations. 

The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for
the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards
for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of
the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.


Remote Andrew Demo Service

You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew
Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11
window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate
through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System
to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups.

To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the
following command on your machine:

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.

Hello,

  I am considering buying the Hummingbird X-Windows software for a MS-Windows
3.1 PC (386-40MHZ, NE2000 Ethernet board).  Would anyone tell me if they
are using this package in a similar environment and if they are happy with
it?  I will be connecting to Sun SparcStation 10 running Sun OS 4.1.3.

Thanks very much,

Summary: trying to detect geometry changes from window manager
Keywords: geometry, mwm

Distribution: usa
Lines: 35

Hi,

I'm trying to get my program to monitor resize/position events,
so that when the program exits, I can save the last known geometry in 
some sort of 'preferences' file.

I am adding an event handler for StructureNotify to the TopLevelShell:

 XtAddEventHandler(topLevel,StructureNotifyMask,False,configureCB,myData);

This works fine, and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).

However, when I'm just resizing the window, using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration, the x and y are set to zero in the
XEvent passed to the event handler callback.  I'm accessing the xconfigure
structure, like the X11 manual says.  (xev->xconfigure.x, xev->xconfigure.y).
The width and height memebers are correct.

When I reposition the window, using the window manager, the xevent's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x, y, width, height member settings.

Q1: Anybody know why, when just resizing, the x and y are being set to zero?

Q2: Any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes?

I've tried using XtGetValues() on the topLevel widget when exiting my
application (before destroying any widgets) and all I get is garbage values
for the x, y, width, height resources.

Thanks

try this after XCreateWindow:
-----------------------------

#include <X11/Xutil.h>

Display display;
Window window;

{
  XSizeHints *xsizehints = XAllocSizeHints ();
  xsizehints->flags = USPosition | USSize;	/* or = PPosition | PSize */
  xsizehints->x = 42;
  xsizehints->y = 42;
  xsizehints->width = 100;
  xsizehints->height = 100;
  XSetWMNormalHints (display, window, xsizehints);
  XFree (xsizehints);
}

These hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values. If you use xsizehints->flags = PPosition | PSize, this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
I don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
you specify the position and size like above.

You are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  What if you are on an
Xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  That is when the
load problems occur.  If you had a machine with 20 Xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

I'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser ""Workstations""!

Hello world,

I want to write my Xt-application code like this:

{
    do_some_work();
    /* now I need some user input */
    XmCreateDialog();
    wait_for_user_input(input);
    if (input == ""OK"") {
       more_work();
    } else {
       other_work();
    }
}

So ""more_work() and other_work()"" are not in callback functions but the
application simply waits for the user to answer the question.

How can I code this in my Xt/Motif-application?

Thanks very much in advance.

Greetings, Huub.

3.2g	(93/04/26)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
	- much faster close colors
	- piping from/to compressed files now handles GNU's gzip (.z)  format
	- added XpmColorKey attribute - ability to specify which visual's
	  colors to use (ie: now it's possible to read in a pixmap in a
	  color visual, but use the colors specified for monochrome).
	- added -mono, -grey4, -grey and -color options to sxpm to demonstrate
	  the XpmColorKey attribute.
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- fixed bug where redefining ""None"" as a pixel stopped mask generation
	- minor SVR4 defines for <string.h>
	- fixed annoying closecolor bug related to read/write color cells
	- fixed minor bug in color value -> pixel overloading
	- manual updated to include new red/green/blue closeness attributes
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>

	- the top Imakefile was missing the depend target
	- sxpm/Imakefile fixed so that -L../lib is set before the standard
	  library location.
		- Vivek Khera <khera@cs.duke.edu>

	- lib/xpmP.h now defines bcopy as memcpy for VMS (required by recent
	  versions of VMS)
		- J. Daniel Smith <dsmith@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com>

	- the lib/Imakefile didn't work with X11R4.

I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system
that has a color hardcopy unit:

	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0

I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager,
and it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image,
the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe,
by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like it's
running out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg
swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB.

This verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the Sun OpenWindows 3.0 distribution
which I believe corresponds to X11 R4.

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance.

it doesnt matter what window mgr you running under, you can use the X
routine:
	XIconfiyWindow(display, w, screen_number)
		Display *display;
		Window w;
		int screen_number;

as in

	XiconifyWindow( XtDisplay(w), XtWindow(w), 0);

does that perform what you want??

   I've been trying to figure a way to programmatically iconize 
   an application running under a Motif window manager.  I have tried
   several approaches includeing sending events to the application's
   border window, but to no avail?  Anyone done this before?

   Thanks,

Any suggestions?

The multi-lingual archives at The Computing Research Labs, New Mexico
State University will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  The
archives are being put under control of the Consortium for Lexical
Research.

The new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current IP address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible).

Please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu.  The crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the Consortium for Lexical Research.

The Arabic, Chinese, French, Italian, Indian, Japanese, Korean,
Tibetan, and Vietnamese archives will all be moved.

We will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved.

Please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  It will take a few days to move
everything.

If you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
languages over the past 2 years.  Most of the software is currently
Unix oriented.  We would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multi-lingual tools.

If you have an item to contribute, please put it in:

clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/

and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
contribution.

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to:
lexical@nmsu.edu

I use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas.
here's a small piece of code that uses those routines

static void Redisplay(pw, ev, region)
XtpManagerWidget pw;
XExposeEvent *ev;
Region region;

/* pp->exposure_region is an XRegion */
XtpManagerPart *pp = &pw->plotter;
pp->exposure_region = XCreateRegion();
   /* region is passed via an expose event */
if(region == NULL)
{
if (ev->send_event)  /* synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw*/
        {
        exporect.x = pw->core.x;
        exporect.y = pw->core.y;
        exporect.width = pw->core.width;
        exporect.height = pw->core.height;
        }
     else
        {
        exporect.x = ev->x;
        exporect.y = ev->y;
        exporect.width = ev->width;
        exporect.height = ev->height;
        }

stuff deleted      

/* region now contains the exposure region */
        XUnionRectWithRegion(&exporect,pp->exposure_region,pp->exposure_region);
}
else
        XUnionRegion ( region, pp->exposure_region, pp->exposure_region);
stuff deleted 
/* WE NEED to CLIP on EXPOSE REGION for REDRAWING the GRID */
        XSetRegion(XtDisplayOfObject(pw), pp->plotarea_gc,pp->exposure_region);
stuff deleted 
        /* check to see if child is exposed */
        if (XRectInRegion (pw->plotter.exposure_region,
                         child->core.x ,
                         child->core.y ,
                         child->core.width  ,
                         child->core.height ))

So, I build up a region of exposures so that when I service my container
widget redraw of rectobj children, I only redraw what need to be redrawn.

It works for me, hope this helps you.

Sounds like you didn't load the support for those libraries when OW3.0 was

Use a GC with the subwindow_mode attribute set to IncludeInferiors. The
default is ClipByChildren. However, beware if any of the children are of
a different depth to the parent; the semantics of this are undefined by the

      Try change the GXxor to GXequiv.  I have to do this for programs that
      are to run on NCD terminals (on Sun terminals I have to change it
      back to GXxor)...

There is a small section in the O'Reilly Xlib books that describes
the right thing to do.  The key is to set the plane_mask in the
GC to the OR of the foreground and background pixel values.

I just implemented this and it seems I can just about achieve the display
rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on IPX) that I get with Sunview, though
it's a bit ""choppy"" at times. Also, loading the data, making an XImage,

slower to load than with Sunview. Is there a better way to load in the

Shared memory PutImage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
Nick Kisseberth) looks interesting, but I need someone to point me to some
documentation. Is this method likely to give better results than server-
resident pixmaps? I'd also be interested in looking at the XView code
mentioned above...

Thanks for the help so far. If I get something decent put together, I'll
definitely post it to the Net.

If you're willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you
want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that
in our internal LYMB system.

We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knob's state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.

Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. You
can make things look circular enough.

*Tutorial topic*  
	_Converting Andrew source code to C++_

This tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from C
(extended with classC) to C++.  Conversion of the source code requires
only a couple of steps:
	run the converter
	fill in missing type information
Describing this will not take long.  The remainder of the day will be
spent learning how to write objects in C++ and practicing.

------------------------------

1993 Andrew Technical Conference and Consortium Annual Meeting
June 24-25, 1993
Carnegie Mellon University
Pittsburgh, PA

The conference will be held on the last Thursday and Friday in June.  A
tutorial will be on Thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the
25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the
two days.  All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting,
though only Consortium members will be able to vote.

This year's theme is 

	Application Construction by Non-Programmers

Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer
construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent
UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will
consider questions such as
	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers?
	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed?
	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to
create new widgets?
	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?

Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate
on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including

	applications
	experience with users
	new objects
	reviews of and proposals for revision of 
		internal Andrew protocols

We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would
like to do a demonstration.  

Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993.
Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.

Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

Can anybody tell me anything about the availibility of non-Roman fonts

Also, how about conversion tools for getting PC/Macintosh fonts into a
format suitable for X? I would assume it is not too difficult for
bitmap fonts.

The FAQ's for this group and comp.fonts are not very helpful on these

BadWindow is an X protocol error.  If you write a custom error handler
which does not do ""exit(1);"" the error handler will return and let
your program carry on.  So, using a XSetErrorHandler is the way to
go, but never mind the longjmp.

Hi Folks.

As part of my self-introduction to X I've been trying to do some simple
icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  Changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple:  If you have a widget ID you can
just XtSetValues on XtNiconifyPixmap (or whatever) and you're done. Alternately
you can set window manager hints.  These methods don't seem to work with
icons which your application doesn't specifically own.

In my situation I have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
my icon box so my question is:  Given a window-id, how do you change the
icon pixure ?  A working example would be very much appreciated.  If it makes
any difference, I'm using motif 1.1 on VMS T6.0-5KE.

Thanks -
Scott :)

I'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64, I'm using Motif 1.1
X11R4 running HP-UX 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no
cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. I tried

using the following code:

unsigned int w,h;
XQueryBestCursor(XtDisplay(programArea), XtWindow(programArea), 72, 71, &w,
&h);

to return the nearest size to what I require however it returns 72 and 71 as
the width and height respectively. What am I doing wrong? and if not how can I
get round the problem!!

Thanks in advance

Hear! Hear! I agree completely. One thing I can't stand about
the Mac interface is its shear determination to FORCE you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is
down!).  I like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  But for most
work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than
using the mouse. Sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it
before your are experienced? A month? Two? (Speaking of PCs at
the moment.)
	I don't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in
less time IF you are experienced.
	All of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
UNIX (especially since Unix is at least 500% more powerful than
DOS).

- Using the ""xv_window_loop"" functions most XView objects dont work
  (as the List Item), and the timers aren't called.
 
- With the ""notify_dispatch"" explicit I have problem because:
  ""...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback

Well, the first 2 are easy.  You need the math library.  Try adding -lm after
-lX11.  Don't know if that's the whole problem but it's a start.

	Greetings,
	We have a network of ~20 Sun Workstations, running SunOS 4.1.1
and Openwindows 3.  7 of these are Sun 3's that we have modified to
run Seth Robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into
xterminals.  We use xdm (X11R4) to manage the displays.

	When we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when
we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.
With 7 clients to 1 Sparc 2, the Sparc 2 window manager is eventually
getting munged.  

	Let me try to be precise:  The user sitting at the machine
that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having
control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (When this was the
department chair, it was kind of cute).  We poked at xdm for a few
days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  Our current theory is
that olwm (the Sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies
on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,
and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal
server). 

	Has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?
	Can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?
	How about obvious gimmes?
	And, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?

	Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Dear Xperts,

I'm developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select
an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the
name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale
button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name:

XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);


and in the eventhandler do a:

  while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))
   ;
  XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);
  /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/


However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co
   urse
a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button. So what is goin
   g wrong?
Or is the a wrong approach to this problem?
Any hints are highly appreciated.

No, it isn't.  It is the ""X Window System"", or ""X11"", or ""X"" or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the X Consortium.  In fact,
doing ""man X"" on pretty much any X11 machine will tell you:

     The X Consortium requests that the following names  be  used
     when referring to this software:

                                  X
                           X Window System
                             X Version 11
                     X Window System, Version 11
                                 X11

There is no such thing as ""X Windows"" or ""X Window"", despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags.  This probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags -- if they can't even get the NAME
of the window system right, why should one trust anything else they have 
to say?

With regard to dialup X11 implementations, there are several.  You can
buy serial X11 terminals from a couple of companies, including both 
GraphOn and NCD.  (In fact, I'm composing this from an NCD running X11
over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)  

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is
NCD's implementation of serial X11) for PC's.  There may be other such 
software packages available.

X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
X11 over low-speed connections.  It's called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and 
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCD's XRemote. 

It seems likely that once LBX is released as a Consortium standard, there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various 
sorts of hardware.

What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program.

	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a

Well I am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.
I am running xterm and like all UNIX users, I run man <something>. Recently,
I switched to Solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with "".I"" directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
The resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very ANNOYING to look at.
Back when I was using SunOS 4.1.2, I remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining....

So my question is how do I change the xterm's behaviour under "".I"" directives 
for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. ("".B"" 
directives are fine, I like them. And of course, I don't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs...) Somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font, but not an italic font??

Any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.
Thanks -- John

P.S. Running xterm -rv won't work, I tried...

I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2.
I am having the following 2 problems.

(1) Many of my Imakefile's have contructs like
		/**/#This is a makefile
	at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C
	preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that
	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
	start of a directive. 

	However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
	as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines
	that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my
	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
	fix.

(2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp
	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.

If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate
information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later
version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpp's
that behave similarly?

Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to

I am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system.  In keeping with more classic command and
control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
I have a number of X level questions regarding this:

(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be 
predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).

I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,
and not multiple X displays.   Given this:

	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's
	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
	screens?

	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate
	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
	What are they; who sells them...

	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a
	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?

	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see
	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?

	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
	multiple screens instead)?  
	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely
	on providing config files which will specify for each
	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
	are more than welcome.

For example, if I get a program executing:

read something
....

echo $something
....

Then I set the argument values for window height and width using XtSetArg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with XtSetValues.
When I call XtRealizeWidget, I get a window of the specified size, but I have no idea how I can draw something in it.

Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)

Hi, 

I'm trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and I'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In
particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some
XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on
some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the
pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.

Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server
bug?

Thanks,

Zack T. Smith

I'm 99&44/100% positive that uwm isn't ICCCM compliant.  If you want it,
the R4 sources are still available on export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)

The Andrew User Interface System is supported, maintained, enhanced, and
distributed by the Andrew Consortium, Carnegie Mellon.  The distribution
terms are those of the X consortium, not the GNU Public License.  Thus
anyone can commercially exploit the Andrew code without restriction. 
(To encourage membership, however, we defer universal release of the
latest versions until Consortium members have had an opportunity to
explore the new capabilities.)

To se what AUIS looks like, you can try a remote demo.  You need an X
server (R5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet.  Give the
command 

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu 

for instructions.

NOTE:  The demo version does not use the Motif-look-and-feel scrollbar,
but one is available.  You can use it on the demo by changing an option
in the ~/preferences file and starting a new editor.

The Andrew Toolkit component of AUIS is ideal if you want to build
applications using compound documents.  Andrew's major feature is its
architecture for recursive embedding of objects: equation in table in
figure in text, for example.  This architecture extends to areas not
usually found in toolkits, including file stream formats, cut/paste, and
printing.

Andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications: 
word processor, spreadsheet, drawing editor, and font editor (the latter
two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the XR6 tape
in December.)

It's called PC-XWare.  It is based on NCD-Ware, their X-terminal
software (which , IMHO, is excellent).  PC-XWare will include
X-Remote and be optimized for 32 bit machines. It's X11R5 based.
It will support remote management, etc.


Not an NCD employee, just a fan :)

I've been able to configure xterm so that I can type in accented characters.
I'm using X11R5, with iso8859 fonts, my shell is tcsh with the following 
definitions : 
setenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1
stty pass8

Then, I add the following in my .Xdefaults file:

XTerm*eightBitInput: True
XTerm*eightBitOutput: True

XTerm*VT100.Translations: #override \
Meta<Key>': keymap(aigu) \n\
Meta<Key>`: keymap(grave) \n\

Meta<Key>\\,: keymap(ced)
XTerm*VT100.aiguKeymap.translations:  \
~Shift <Key>e: string(0xe9) keymap(None)\n\
<Key>E: string(0xc9) keymap(None) \n\
~Shift <Key>c:  string(0xe7) \n\
<Key> C:  string(0xc7)
XTerm*VT100.graveKeymap.translations: \

XTerm*VT100.cedKeymap.translations: \
~Shift <Key>c:  string(0xe7) keymap(None)\n\
<Key> C:  string(0xc7) keymap(None)

This makes the Meta-{',`,^} keys behave as dead keys.

Of course, this only works for xterm. For emacs, my solution is to install the
Lucid version of GnuEmacs 19, and to load the x-compose library.


Hope this helps,

Why do many (?) people believe that Xhibition '93 is one of the ""paid
market hype NT conferences"" (as you put it)? I for one am going, because
I, too, am curious about the technology. I think this is a great chance
to learn about NT, mainly because:

  - It will be presented in X's ""home turf"". I believe that the attendees
    will mostly have X backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, I expect that the
    NT presentations will face a tough audience.

  - I can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not NT is what
    it is hyped to be. This is as closely as I can get to in evaluating the
    NT technology without actually using it myself, which I don't have the
    time to do.

  - If NT turns out to be a vapor technology and I get bored, there will be
    many other interesting tutorials/presentations that I won't have to
    waste my time ... in California?!?  :-)

Just my thoughts...

There is X for the Amiga, but it'll cost you.  GfxBase Inc., owned by
Dale Luck, one of the original Amiga architects, sells X for the Amiga.
There are many options available, including Motif.  Call 'em and get the

Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers)
=====================================================================

I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?

1. Free options
	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2.
	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will
	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86
	is listed below.

	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was
	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com).
	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards.
	There are 2 major free versions: X386 1.1 is based on X11R4,
	X386 1.2 is included in MIT's X11R5 distribution (ie. you
	don't need to patch it into the MIT source any more).
	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?

3. What is XFree86?

   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with
   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:

    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,
       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require
       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of
       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by
       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield
       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.
    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default
       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now
       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately
       20% faster than X386 1.2.
    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,
       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4
       with the 'Advanced Compatibility Package', local connections from
       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.
    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.
       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about
       the ATI and Trident drivers.
    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt's
       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is
       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the
       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
    7) New configuration method which allows the server's drivers and font
       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
       distributions.
    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.
    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA
       cards is now included.

   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2
   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):

    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of
       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 
       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).
    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the
       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two
       headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only
       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).
    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to
       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for
       more information.)
    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some 
       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous
       documentation and a lot of experimentation).
    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including
       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many 
       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more 
       information).
    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has
       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks
       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.
    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig
       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative
       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new
       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) 
       manual page for more information on the format of this file).

       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file
       in the source distribution for full details.

   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the
   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.

4. What OSs are supported?

    XFree86 supports:
	SVR4.2: Consensys V4.2
	SVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC
	SVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2
	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1

	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active
	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.

	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,
	but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to
	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. What video hardware is supported?

   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:

	Tseng ET4000
	Tseng ET3000
	Paradise PVGA1
	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of
		the PVGA1, and use its driver)
	Genoa GVGA
	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000
	ATI 18800, 28800

	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,
	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in
	256 color mode.

	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the
	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.

	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to
	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To
	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86
	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how
	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such
	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with
	future XFree86 releases.

	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,
	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the
	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not
	work with them, because Diamond won't provide programming details.
	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond
	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions
	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.

	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA
	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the
	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It
	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset
	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don't have a lot
	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested
	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not
	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86
	working fine on them.

6. What about accelerated boards?

	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards
	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available
	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).

	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact
	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.

	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>
	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.

7. Why doesn't XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?

	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the
	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory
	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-
	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-
	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled
	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code
	could be modified to support this (or it already may; I'm not sure).
	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer
	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,
	but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?

	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run
	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.
	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending
	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will
	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable 
	lower bound.

9. Where can I get source for XFree86?

	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22
	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:
		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)
		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)
	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)

	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information
	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?

	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP from:
		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries
			under /XFree86/SVR4
		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86
		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries
			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4
		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/ISC
		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries
			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86
		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries
			under /pub/linux/packages/X11
		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries
			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86
		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries
			under /i386

	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may
	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will
	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take
	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were
	made when building the distribution.

IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?

11. Installation directories

	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot
	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include
	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.

	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified
	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is
	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed
	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.

12. Configuration files

	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup.
	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in
	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes

	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.
	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and
	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is
	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on
	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated
	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the
	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to
	David for inclusion in the database.

	If this doesn't help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file 
	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use
	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information
	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

	NOTE: The old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more, and
	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot
	      clock values for a new board, remove the 'Clocks' line from
	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The
	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
	      You can use these values to put a 'Clocks' line into your
	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up
	      starting the server in the future.

14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit

	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to
	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is
	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.

V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?

	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).

15. SVR4
	Why won't my xterm run properly?

	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define
	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won't run.
	csh users should use 'setenv CONSEM no'

	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be
	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. SVR3

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that's what you are running.

17. 386BSD

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.

	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey
	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the
	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:

	    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2
	    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2

18. Linux

	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc
	jump libraries installed.

	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.

	If your kernel doesn't have TCP support compiled in, you'll have to
	run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes
	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files
	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the
	-pn argument to X386.

	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major
	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not
	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit
	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but
	startx won't.

	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with
	a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".

	For more detailed information, please read the file README present
	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.

19. Mach

	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.

VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?

	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is
	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.
	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.

VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?

20. BSD compatibility library

	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.
	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a
	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),
	seed(). A better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro
	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV 'mem' functions.  If you are
	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a

21. ANSICCOPTIONS

	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite
	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you'd see
	something like
		CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of
		ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi""
		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings""
	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:
		ANSICCOPTIONS=
	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death
	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because
	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must
	add 'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

XFree86 Contact Information

    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86
    Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of:

	The original ""gang of four"":

Subject: Connecting a digitiser to X (REPOST)

Hi there

(I posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so I'm posting
here.)

I'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for PCs into my workstation (an HP 720).
It is my understanding the X windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets.  However, this digitiser makes use of the serial
port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.

The HP manual pages say that the HP X server will accept X input from
devices listed in the /usr/lib/X11/X*devices file (* = display number).
I shouldn't think I would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Am I?

What I would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for X (rather than just as input to a
specific X application)?  If so, what were the steps required for installation?
Did you need a special device driver?  Did the manufacturer supply it?  Are
there generic public domain device drivers around?  (I understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers
- Vaughan

The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to

Xm++/CommonInteract    Another User Interface Development System
-------------------

If you would like to implement X-Toolkit applications with C++ in a style
like this...

// mini sample application /////////////////////////////////////

class Test : public XmWindow {
	void cmd(char*);
	void quit(void*);
public:

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

...then continue reading (contents of the current release's README):

Xm++ is a user interface framework for the C++ language built upon X11
and the X-Toolkit. It is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming
interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.
Xm++ was initially created for the Motif widget set, now support for the
Athena widgets was added. Applications created with Xm++ run in both
environments without changes, although many nice features are only
available when using Motif.
In some situations Xm++ extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing
a ComboBox borrowed from MS-Windows), but never tries to replace it -
data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated
in rare cases.

Xm++ has nothing common with Motif++ besides the general idea to
encapsulate Motif widgets in C++ objects and the '++' in it's name. Many
ideas for the Xm++ architecture came from Digitalk's Smalltalk version,
which provides an easy to use framework for Windows/PM/Mac applications
(in the very first time of development I used the Windows dialog editor and
a simple parser to create similar Smalltalk and Xm++ dialogs :-).

Top level objects in Xm++:
* 'Windows', 'SystemDialogs' and 'ToolBoxes' which use the automatic layout
  feature of various composite widgets in Motif and Xaw
* 'UserDialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface
  builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this
  distribution)

Controls (children of top level objects):
'staticText', 'staticImage', 'pushButton', 'checkBox', 'radioButton',
'edit', 'listBox', 'comboBox', 'groupBox', 'paneArea', 'drawing', 'toolBar'

The staticImage and all the button classes can display b/w (X-bitmap
format) or color (GIF format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.

Event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects
Xt callbacks to member functions of Xm++ objects.


CommonInteract(II) is built upon the Xm++ drawing class and provides
components for building direct manipulative applications. Is is a very
simplified implementation of some features from the CommonInteract system
(research project of our institute in 1991), an approach to define a
software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications
with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound, alternative input devices).
If you are interrested, look into the June 1993 issue of the JOOP (SIGS
Publications - Journal of Object Oriented Programming) - there should be
our paper about CommonInteract (but be aware, that it is our 'state of
the art' from 1991).
CommonInteract(II) is still undocumented and is included because it was
used to implement the dialog editor. It currently supports only drawing
primitives (lines, rectangles, circles...), but we plan to extend it to
support bitmaps and some controls also.
Known problem: the Xm++ drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always
redraws the whole window, even after minimal changes like selecting an
object), this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.


About this first release:

Xm++ is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here
for smaller applications which are running without problems. So I think
I can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications
for any non-critical purposes.
CommonInteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. It's development will
be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research
project here. Besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems
to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.

Platforms: this release was compiled and tested on:
  HP9000/720 running HP-UX 8.07
  SUN SPARC running SunOS Release 4.1.1
  PC-AT386 running Linux v0.99pl6

Caution: although the whole stuff was initially developed using an AT&T
standard C++ compiler - this release is tested only with GNU g++ 2.3.3 or
above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

Reply-To: dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk

Hi, I'm new to this group so please bear with me!

Two years ago I wrote a Sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. With Sunview becoming rapidly obselete, I've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in XView.
I put together a quick test, and I've found that XPutImage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
Sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. This was on a Sparc IPX. It seems that:
(1) the X protocol communication is slowing things down; or
(2) XPutImage is inefficient...or both! My question is, what
is the fastest way in X11R5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window? Can I take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server? Or am I stuck with
XPutImage() (in which case I might as well give up now...)?

All help appreciated...thanks!

Subject: Input Focus to a Window Other Than Where the Pointer Is
Nntp-Posting-Host: pookie.crd.ge.com
Organization: GE Corp. Research & Development, Schenectady, NY
Lines: 21


I have noticed in FrameMaker 3.1X on both the SGI and SUN platforms
that certain dialogs, such as ""Column Layout..."" for example, respond
to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is NOT in the dialog
window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is
POINTER.

How is this done?

I would like to emulate this behavior in my application. It seems a
reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard
action, the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the
user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

Alternatively, I'm open to any suggestions as to what is the ""right""
way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear, particularly
when they are invoked from the keyboard and one's keyboard focus
policy is pointer.

You need to start the X-server with -indirect its_name.

If you start it with -indirect localhost, it use the loopback adress as
it's adress. So when it try to contact another host, this one try to answer
on its loopback adress. Not good.

Remember that every machine has the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.

To incrementally update the contents of windows, I use the following trick:

	1. Set the window background to None,
	2. Call XClearArea(display, window, 0, 0, 0, 0, True),
	3. Restore the window background to its correct value.

The call to XClearArea does not repaint the window background, but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

In order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased), I encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages, which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

XGrabServer(display)
client message (start-incremental)
 	background None
	XClearArea
	Restore background 
client message (end-incremental)
XUngrabServer(display)

The GrabServer prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the
critical section.

Lines: 38

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]


I am looking for a  program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my Linux
system.

- It must be free.
- It must run on standard (monochrome) X with a small screen size (800x600)
  No motif/openlook etc.
- It must compile under Linux with gcc/g++. Most generic unix software
  works ok.
- It must produce postscript files that I can include into LaTeX documents
  with dvips. Or just tell me another free program that converts one
  of the supported formats to ps.
- It must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).

I know of several such programs, idraw, xfig. tgif. I have
no experience with any of them. Features I would like in the programs are.

- ability to draw circles, arcs, straight lines, boxes and arrows.
- support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.
- support for texts in any size.
- ability to move/copy/resize/rotate any part of the drawing.
- ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
  (e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines, an arrow and a circle)
- any aid (numeric coordinates, screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.
- less essential, but in fact very handy: preservation of connection.
  If I move one part of the drawing, the lines that connect that part to the
  rest of the drawing, stay connected.

Ideally I want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics, flow charts, logic diagrams, data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it. 

I just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs? How demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space, memory and CPU usage? Are any of the programs
known to work on Linux with monochrome X?

Can anyone out there tell me how to get the total number of color cells
allocated in the default colormap?

e.g.   colormap = DefaultColormap(mydisplay, myscreen);

The MAXIMUM number of allocated cells is given by DefaultCells(mydisplay,
myscreen), but in general the number of cells actually allocated will be
much less than this, depending on the color requirements of the windows
currently in place. I'd like a way to determine this number. Thanks in

Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have
   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be
   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.
   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?

I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create something
which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn't
be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this
as an alternative.

   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they
   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!
   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not
   yet have the spec)?

Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you
looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD 
widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list
you could port.

Subject: Creating 8 bit windows on 24 bit display.. How?
Organization: FWI, University of Amsterdam
Lines: 75
Nntp-Posting-Host: carol.fwi.uva.nl

Greetings,


I am using an X server that provides 3 visuals:
PseudoColor 8 bit, Truecolor 24 bit and DirectColor 24 bit.

A problem occurs when I try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is TC24).

In the Xlib reference guide from 'O reilly one can read in the
section about XCteateWindow, something like:
""In the current implementation of X11: When using a visual other than the
parent's, be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used 
in the window attributes when creating, or else a BadMatch occurs.""

This warning, strangely enough, is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the X11R5 guides.

However, even if I pass along a suitable colourmap, I still get a BadMatch
when I create a window with a non-default visual.
The code looks like this:

------------------ cut here and you'll destroy your CRT ----------------

Window create_8bit_window_on_truecolour_display(dpy,width,height)
Display *dpy;
int width, height;
{
  Window win;
  XVisualInfo vinfo;
  XSetWindowAttributes attr;

  fprintf(stderr,""Opening 8 bit window...\n"");
  if (!XMatchVisualInfo(dpy,DefaultScreen(dpy),8,PseudoColor,&vinfo)) {
    fprintf(stderr,""Your display can't handle 8 bit PseudoColor.\n"");
    exit(1);
  }
  fprintf(stderr,""Using visual: %x\n"",vinfo.visual->visualid);
  cmap = XCreateColormap(
           dpy,
           DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
           vinfo.visual,
           AllocNone
         );
  XSync(dpy,False);
  XInstallColormap(dpy,cmap);	/* ommision of this line gives same result */
  attr.colormap = cmap;
  win = XCreateWindow(
          dpy,
          DefaultRootWindow(dpy),
          10,10,
          width,height,
          CopyFromParent,       /* border width */
          8,                    /* depth */
          InputOutput,          /* class */
          vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
          CWColormap,
          &attr
        );
  return win;
}

--- cut here and you'll destroy your CRT -----

Executing this piece of code results in a BadMatch error.
Anybody who knows why?
If so, please drop me a line.

I don't seem to be able to get window positions reliably through
the XView xv_get() function:

   x = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_X);
   y = (int) xv_get(my_frame, XV_Y);

For example, if I set XV_X & XV_Y to 50,50 the frame comes up
in the correct position, with the top left corner (the size
handle) at 50,50. xv_get() returns 50,50 as well. But later on
xv_get() returns 5,25 without any intervening xv_set(my_frame,
XV_?). My frame is fitted around a canvas, and it turns out
(by measuring on the screen) that 5,25 is the position of the
first pixel in my canvas relative to the frame's origin. What
gives? Any help most appreciated!

Derek

P.S. On a related subject, is there any way of querying the
window manager as to the thickness of borders it puts around
frames, etc.?

 From the README file of version 4.99c:

 This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for
 many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size
 and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard
 x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
 bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
 may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different
 line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of
 distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in
 the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek
 alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts
 can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device
 drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile
 format and renderer.

 The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.
 The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly
 granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without
 consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT
 object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it
 is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely
 available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed
 somewhere in the documentation for the package.

 We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of
 user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any
 published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,
 which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that
 as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the
 kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest
 in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only
 afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on
 those which help us get our work done.

 PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically
 without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub
 routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any
 modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the
 header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details.

 The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of
 several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex
 plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
 the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained
 there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.  

 At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:

	 Unix:	SunOS
		 A/IX 
		 HP-UX
		 Unicos
		 DG/UX
		 Ultrix
		 SysV
		 Linux

	 Amiga/Exec
	 MS-DOS
	 OS/2
	 NeXT

 For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:

  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Bad idea. using /usr/5bin/echo is slower than the built-in echo.

Unless you run `xlock -mode blank`, xlock consumes CPU time generating
the nice animated display. The code you are running is competing with
xlock for the CPU. If you run top (via a remote login), you can really
see what is going on.

Using XPutImage, your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever client-server communications
mechanism you are using.

Is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps?
These are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is
much cheaper.

Also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary XSyncs, or running
in XSynchonize mode.

I  am  having  a  big problem trying to build MIT X11R5 with xlc 1.2.1
(the  one  bundled  with  AIX  3.2.3e).   Its almost the linker is not
working properly with shared libraries.

I've built X11R5 with no problem before .. but now its all  headaches.
For example, the xset client complains that libXmu doesnt have a bunch
of Xt routines and shr.o is missing (or  something  like  that).   The
build of libXmu DOES link in libXt  so I am really perplexed  what  is
going on.

The fee is a suggestion for an individual but licensing is mandatory

I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that
comes with the IPX.  What fixed the problem for me was to apply the ""sunGX.uu""
that was part of Patch #7.  Patch #1 also used this file so perhaps you
didn't apply the one that came with Patch #7.

Hello,

I have a problem with X11R5 on a Sun386i an I hope that someone can help
me with it.
I've built X from the MIT sources after applying all patches I have got (I
think 23). Building was easy. After installing everything I started X but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed
to hang. I loged in from another machine an found the Sun386i running well.
'ps' told me that there's a X-server and a xterm running. And with some 
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^D I blindly hit the
xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.
I guess it's a device problem but I did not find the correct device yet.
I've got a Sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ACE-6 0688 94V-0, Rev 53)
SunOS 4.0.2 and ROM 4.4.
Please help me. I'm able to run clients on the Sun and send the output to
other machines but that's not what I did it for.

Thanks in advance,
Stefan

Subject: Callback parameter problem after X11R5 upgrade
Organization: Hughes Aircraft Company
Lines: 24


We've just recently upgraded our X11 to R5 and are now running into problems
with some of our applications that use Motif 1.1.  It appears that pointer to
the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the ""w"" of
(w, client, call) ) is nil.  The client and call pointers are okay in some
instances, but bogus in other instances.

We are running SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun 4.  After compiling X11R5 and all 23
patches (with the MotifBC flag set), we recompiled Motif and then we 
recompiled the application.

Did we skip a step or leave something out?  Is there a flag that we should
have used?  Should we have left Motif alone?

Any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Kathy

That's expected. The first sentence describing the bitmap resource in the
MenuButton section of the ""Athena Widget Set - C Language Interface""
documentation states

      bitmap      A bitmap to display instead of the label.

One way round this might be to make use of the button's backgroundPixmap
resource, but remember that you, or a user of your application, won't be able
to set it from a resource file. Also, the button won't automatically be the
size of the bitmap. The bitmap will be tiled if necessary, or you could set the
button's dimensions to match its size.

You allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/emu.tar.Z.
We've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
You can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal / ver-
tical line cursors, smaller block cursors), turn on and off blinking,
set the blink rate and so on. You even get blinking text - ok, enough

I haven't looked at the xterm code in this respect, but from the memories
I have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text), I'd say it won't be easy, since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it's roots back to
X10).

The actual task to get the cursor to blink isn't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. As Antonio mentioned, you'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved, or people will become confused.
Since it's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you 
do anything on screen anyways, this isn't very complicated. You'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it's mapped.

As for the portability of emu and it's newest version. The one on export
is still the same as on the R5 contrib tape. We wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now, but unfortunately we're drowning in work.
But since the changes aren't affectiong emu's behavior much, I'd say
whoever wants to try emu shouldn't wait for a new version.

As is, emu won't work on BSD derived systems (e.g. SUNs) with anything else 
than a csh. There is a fix to this, which is very short (remove one line
of code). I'll put this on export today.

I currently use a window manager called ctwm which
is very similar to hp's vuewm. (i.e. 
it has multiple workspaces).  Is there a 
motif based window manager that has this 
same feature and is not a memory pig like vue?

Is there a portable and convenient way to use color picture files in
the .xpm format to define an X pixmap in a Motif application? Any
functions, pointers, tips etc. would be most welcome.

I find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing.  If I were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators, I would have one
resource called ""accelerators"" that took a translation table, period.
I would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed.  As soon as the end-user specified
one, it would be active and automatically installed.

To get multiple accelerators on a single menu item I'd do something like:

	*menuItem.accelerators: #override \n\
		Ctrl<Key>M:	fire() \n\
		Shift<Key>L:	fire() \n

The accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a ""Ctrl M"" show up in your menuItem object.

Why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you're dealing with?  There
has to be some reason.

Sorry for the political tone of this message...

Seeing as Motif has been adopted by Sun, IBM, HP +++ (can't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement), I'm sure you'll see it on
virtually every workstation (ie. Sun, IBM, HP and DEC must make up the
**VAST** majority of all hardware).

Ports of Motif to both 386BSD and Linux are available for a fee of about
$100.  This is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute.  The activity in both the BSD and Linux news groups
pertaining to Motif has been high.

I can't see why.  If just about every workstation will come with Motif
by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the ""free"" UNIX
platforms, I can't see this causing major problems.


Side Note :
---------
All the X based code I am writing (and will distribute freely when
completed) is based on Motif because from a programmatic and also ""look
and feel"" point of view I like it the best (no flames on this one
please).

Whatever happened to uwm? Is it still available in some form? It's

You have to do the same sorts of things that Xt does with its main loop.
That is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a 
select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.  You can obtain the 
file descriptor of the X display connection using 
    fd = ConnectionNumber (display);

The functionality of the main loop dispatcher in Xt is quite useful.
The good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!
