CAD Setup For Sale:

G486PLB Local Bus Motherboard
  Can use up to 32MB of SIMMS (256k/1M/4M)
  9 expansion slots (8 16-bit slots, 1 32-bit slot)
  Weitek 4167 co-processor socket

G-Host4000 Local Bus ET4000 Video Card
  Based on Tseng Labs' ET4000 chip design
  Supports resolutions up to 1280x1024 interlaced or non-interlaced
  Uses RAMDAC to allow up to 32k colors in 800x600, 65k colors in 640x480
  Register level compatible with CGA, EGA, VGA, MDA
  Software drivers available for 1-2-3, Symphony, Autocad, Autoshade,
   Windows, Wordperfect, VESA and 8514/A Emulation
  also contained on the card:
    Local Bus IDE controller
    Floppy Disk controller
    Two fully configuarable serial ports
    1 Parallel port

  I used this setup to run AutoCad and 3D Studio.  The combination of
 Local Bus and the Weitek co-processor made for VERY fast CAD and modeling
 work.  The Weitek coprocessor can cut 3D Studio render times in half and
 sometimes more.  It also increases redraws and regens when modeling in
 both 3D Studio and Autocad.  Everything is less than a year old.  I am
 asking $950.00 + shipping for the whole package.  Please respond via email.
 Thanks.

Sorry to waste the bandwidth. Does anyone know a software mail order company 
called ""Software Unlimited""? I ordered a software from them and they charged my
credit card but never did send the package to me.

I call them many times but nobody answer the phone. I also check Computer

++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale:

(2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on
    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell
    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already
    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked
    in cars.

    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was
    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit.


(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,
    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.
    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into
    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well.

    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on
    it.

This is a reposting 'cause two of the bags are out the door, and I took
dimensions of #1 and #5 (important to camcorder users).

    1. Large padded Cordura bag (maker unknown) orange exterior, black
	 straps and interior.  Five outside pockets plus lid compartment.
	 Lid overlaps.  Internal dividers can be repositioned.  Held
	 my whole 2-1/4 Bronica system, Metz flash, etc.  Main chamber
	 (not incl lid and pockets) is 18.5""W x 9""H x 7"" D.  Very
	 strong bag, good for medium format users or videographers.

    2. Small ""Nikon"" shoulder bag. SORRY.  SOLD & SHIPPED.

    3. Small ""Nikon"" belt pouch.  Khaki like #2.  Similar in design to
	 US Army ammo pouch - belt clips, etc.  Holds flash or small
	 zoom (35-70) fixed lens, lens cleaner, etc.  $5.

    4. Domke belt pouch, black.  SORRY. SOLD & SHIPPED.

    5. Coast camera bag - tan with brown strap.  Main and front pocket.
	 Can hold AF slr with small zoom plus flash, film, etc. 10.5""H
	 x 9.5 H x 4.5 D plus 10.5"" x 6.5 x 1.5 front pouch. It
	 looks like Gore-Tex but I don't think it really is. $15.

TERMS:  Payment in advance by money order/bank check, or cash.  Buyer
pays shipping.  #1 should go UPS.  For the others, send me an adequate
self addressed mailing envelope (padded recommended) with enough postage.
Please contact me by email if interested.

Subject: Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer for sale
Originator: rob@snoopy.msc.cornell.edu
Organization: cluttered-but-in-order
Lines: 71


Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:
I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more ""digital"".
Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:
  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings.
  o A 3.5"" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly ""page-driven""
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on
    the SQ-80.

This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer
(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.

>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped
short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80
is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.
Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most
good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.
This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have
an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it.

REASON FOR SALE:
I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard.

PRICING AND TERMS:
I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept
$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of 
patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the 
original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.

Price:    Asking $650.00 (everything)
Shipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states

          mint with the exception of the 3 that have split  seam 
          on  the  cover  only but are otherwise perfect, no cut 
          outs or missing pages.  I have Sep, Nov and Dec issues 
          for 1978, ALL issues for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983 
          and  Jan  thru  Sep  for  1984  (72  issues  in  all i

          sold  as  a  single  lot.  Send  your  offers  to  me. 
          Shipping not included,  these  are  pretty  heavy.  Of

Subject: Not all deals are bad...
Organization: University of Northern Iowa

Fellow netters,

I just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of Iowa).  I'm sorry if anyone thinks that I am wasting
space, but I thought you might want some relief from the ""So-and-so is a thief""
posts.  Not that I think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.

After seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, I mailed Mr. Mark Miller a
request for his copy of WordPerfect 5.1 for DOS.  He suggested a price of $50
in his ad, but when I phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  That sounded
more than fair to me, so I told him that I would send him a check the next day. 
Imagine my surprise when I logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after I had just mailed
the money order).  After another E-Mail message to him, he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - I was the one who he was holding it for.  He
sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
transfer of license.  This wasn't good enough for WordPerfect, so I asked him
to fill out one of their forms.  No problem - we thought.  It took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault).  Anyway, he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a Workbook that I had no idea was included in the
deal.  Again, he apologized for not sending it before.  I now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left.  I recoend that if you ever see that Mark is selling anything thatat
you may want, give him a call.  If I had the choice, I would purchase all of my
software from him.

Bravo, Mr. Miller!

For sale:  Precision drafting machine, Bruning OGP-0180.  Solid
older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  Without
scales.  For right handed person.  $60/make offer, includes UPS/parcel post 
postage.

I'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for 
excellent drafting machine construction! :-)
It's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted 
the typical office grey popular in that period.  It's smooth working, and 
each of the two ""arms"" on it measures roughly 24"".  It has a dual clamp to 
enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

Fellow netters,

I have an Okidata printer I would like to sell.  A description follows:

Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics
parallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,
and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. 
I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample 
can be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never
jams or does ""weird"" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next
post) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the 
Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode. 

When I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine
from Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about
$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring
(E-Mail) and make an offer.

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Items for sale.....

Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended
			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring
			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four
			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm
			film.

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.
			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is
			_not_ included.

Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.
				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not
				included. The voucher is good for all 3
				locations, but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and
			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as
			usual.


Asking for $500 or best offer...

I paid $697 for the whole package. And it is too late for me to get the 
refund. I would sell it for $500 for the whole package. Details could be 
provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if 
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you 
sell the camera to other for a higher price. If you are interested in 
the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.

Some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you 
are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out 
of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as 
I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't 
bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package 
within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). 
Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

I still have about 70 records left on hand, all in pristine condition
(except where noted), quite a few out-of-print and more than a few
imports in the bunch.

Rather than selling the majority for $3-4 each, I'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET.  I'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced
with CD, as well as pre-recorded videos on Beta or VHS.  In the past,
I've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list/store price
(e.g., 1 CD = 1 movie in Beta format*) to get around what you or I
might have originally paid (as if we can even remember!  (-;) **

[At this time, I'm looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable
batteries ... if you have some lying around, and they're sound, RSVP!]

So if you're curious, RSVP for my list and if you see anything that
you like, send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you're selling ... thanks!

gld

* i.e., the imports and out-of-prints are also valued at 1 used CD;

** I once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records (list $81);
Anybody got a nice, unused blender for making frozen margaritas? (-;

PS: There have been NO additions since the last posting in February;
        the list has only shrunk as I've made a few deals since.

Oh no!  Someone is provided useful information AND mentioned that they

uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff

The net is not ""supposed"" to be a dumping ground for free ads, but
reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.

>In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
>used for generating junk mail.  

So?  Either they target it well enough to pay for it, in other words,
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it
is junk only for the ""rest"" and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt.  Seems fair to me.

>Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
>done to penalize such an improper use?

You could hold your breath.  You could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further,
but not until you turn blue.

I have a pair of Oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  I hardly ever

blue and are the ""blade"" kind (Terminator style).  I am willing to sell these

I also have a Bulls vs. Blazers game for the SNES that is in perfect

FOR SALE!!!!

1) Sony Car Stereo Amplifier (Model XM-2040)
	Rated Power 20Wx4, into 4 Ohms from 20-20,000Hz @0.5%THD
	2 Ohm Stable
        Short Circuit and Overload Protected
 
This is a great little amplifier that I picked up as a demo model at Lechmere
last spring, and never got a chance to install. It's been tested, and it 
works great...a perfect amplifier for adding 4-speaker power to a system, or 
for powering mids or tweets...whatever. Mounted on a board, complete with a 
RS 15 Amp noise filter, with all connections made to barrier strips for easy 
screw-type contacts. Lists new in Crutchfield for $129, am asking 
			$75 O.B.O complete


2) Sony Electronic Crossover (Model XEC-500)
	Freq Response 5-100,000 Hz (+0,-3 dB)
	S/N Ratio 105 dB (A wtd.)
	High Pass X-Over @flat,80,120,180 Hz (12dB/octave)
	Low Pas X-Over @50,80,120,180 Hz (18dB/octave)
	1/2 DIN size for In-Dash Installation in many cars!

This to,l is an exceptional unit which I found extremely useful  back in the 
days when I had a car to put a stereo in. Two sets of RCA-type inputs (F/R), and Three sets of Outputs (F/R/Sub) Each output with seperate level control. 
variable Low Boost control (+10 dB@40 Hz) for extending low bass, and seperate High and Low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who's 
interested in building a Sub/Satellite type system 
	
	Used with orig. box&Papers $130 O.B.O
	 

Both units work flawlessly, and are in excellent shape cosmtically (ie No 
scratches, etc.) Anyone who is interested, please respond to 
	
	coates@wpi.wpi.edu

I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have...oh yeah if you want both
I'll sell the Amp with th X-Over for $175 or so...Thanks

It is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.  

Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use?

Well, I've been informed that the price on the whole thing I'm selling is now
less than the price I'm selling it for.  That will teach me to wait that long
before getting rid of electronic equipment.  Nevermind, everyone, I'm keeping

I don't want him nuked, I want him to be honest.  The junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  If I'd known
what I was going to get, I wouldn't have hesitated.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
""nope"" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.
Similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead.

The folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and
so would the people reading it.

Update:

	No, I or my friends with me now have not delt with him, but we
did try to call him, and there's no answer at his phone.

	The call was made at midnight EST; God knows what time that is

	We'll try again later.

     For Sale:  24 Pin Printer - ALPS Allegra 24

     Asking Price:  $150 shipped prepaid
                             (C.O.D. orders pay C.O.D. shipping).

     Features:

            Straight paper path (won't jam).
            Paper saving tear-off capability (no need to waste a sheet to
               get a current printout).
            Programmable preferences (you don't even need a computer)
            Letter Quality 360dpi output
            Epson LQ2500 emulation built-in
            Card slot for additional memory / font upgrades
            Printer ribbons easily found (there are three or four sources
               for ALPs ribbons in every Computer Shopper).
            Fast 180 CPS output
            This printer has not even been used in the last two years (three
               years old) because I have a laser printer at work and use that
               instead.
            Originally $399.

            I'll even throw in two ribbons (may need simple reinkings tho).

Article-I.D.: pdxgate.7251
Distribution: or
Organization: Portland State University, Computer Science Dept.
Lines: 30

I recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out I don't really have a need
for my old 386.  I'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case
etc, so I'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide.

I'm asking $325 for the motherboard, which has:
    25Mhz 386 DX (not SX)
    8 megabytes of 32-bit, 70ns memory
    AMI BIOS
    based on C&T NEAT chipset
    	(this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are
	programmable - the BIOS' advanced configuration menus let you
	select system, DMA, bus clock, wait states, command delays, etc.)
    ""baby AT"" sized - fits in mini-tower, full-sized or most any other case
(Includes User's Guide and a copy of the BIOS reference manual)

For $150 more you could have the rest of the system too:
    full-size AT case with 200(?) watt power supply
    2 serial, 1 parallel, 1 game ports
    20Mb hard disk
    1.2Mb floppy disk
    keyboard
    video card (choice of VGA or ???)

If you're interested, please give me a call.  The system is set up at my house
in Aloha, and you're welcome to come test drive it.

                  on carriers, flying -- of course -- and better
                  yet, it is also a battle simulator.  It is a

                  bold and bold italic versions are included with
                  all those fonts.  Because of the unique font
                  software included with the package, these fonts
                  can be used with either the MoreFonts typeface
                  program, Adobe Type Manager, TrueType, GeoWorks,
                  Express Publisher and CorelDRAW.
                o An IBM PC with Windows 3.1 and a hard disk is

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or
02106@brahms.udel.edu

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

Subject: HELP: How to get a SCUMSTER
Summary: Need advice 
Keywords: HD, cash/check, no delivery
Organization: University of Virginia

Lines: 34


Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a
regular basis.

	IMHO, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  DoubleSpace seems a bit 
saner than Stacker 2.0 (which I've replaced).  MemMaker is nowhere near as 
aggressive as QEMM, but it doesn't hose my system like QEMM did (at least
it hasn't yet).  Microsoft AntiVirus is just the latest version (or a 
reasonably recent one) of CPAV - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.

 	MS-DOS 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's
better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort 
of thing.  :-)

I'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I
only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to
UPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.
I will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also
tell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.

Other things to watch out for/consider:

	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.

	For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate
	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the
	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many
	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox
	operator told me I was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them
	before with NO problems), etc. Right.

	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local
	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the
	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)

	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over
	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had
	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)
	have told horror stories about them...

	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by
	Mailbox.

	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...

	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy
	air rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!

	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!

Grey color matches case

All original manuals and documentation, video drivers, etc. are included.

You are probably wondering why I must sell the case with the motherboard.
It is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and
  you would be hard-pressed to fit another MB in it.  However, the case and
  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.

As you can see, since this board includes drive controllers AND a video 
  controller, you can save some money by buying this unit and not a MB
  where you would need to get IO cards, video card, and drive controllers
  Its just a lot more convenient on the whole

I would like to ask about $500 for this whole package.  I think this is a fair
  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/IO
  ports.  All you need to do is add drives, a monitor, RAM, and a keyboard. 
  Also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board, but from CompuAdd.
I also will entertain all serious offers.

Please email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu

Hello Everyone,

    I have a Casio TV-470 LCD Color Television for sale.  It
is in mint condition.  Retail is $199 but I'm looking to
get about 1/2 of that for it, tops.  Highest bidder in 
a week gets it, assuming the highest bidder is at least $60.

TV comes with black case and uses 4 AA batteries.  They also
sell AC adaptor.  It has external jack for phones and external
antenna, etc.  The picture is very good and it has electronic
tuning so you don't have to screw with tuning a picture in, etc.
I have the box and all documentation.  This has seen less than
3 hours use as I have all but sworn off TV.

Best Regards
Jack Waters II

I have a Tektronix T921 15Mhz scope for sale.  It is a nice, simple
unit to learn on.  I used it while I was in school.  If you want one
to play with at home, this is easy and inexpensive.  It has a nice
handle and is quite lightweight and easy to move around.

I will consider selling the probes seperately for $25 ea.  They are HP
10017A probes suitable for this type of scope.  The probes are NOT
included in the price of $99 for the scope.

If you need more technical info, you will have to come look at it, as
I am not a scope expert and what I have said is all I know.

Mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged

(A4000-EC030/4 megs/120meg IDE HD/HD Floppy/v3.0 OS - $1899)?

I'd like to get an A3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1K without monitor.  Brand new the A3000-25mhz/50 meg HD/HD
floppy/2.1 ROM isn't running for more than $1400 or so.

Considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the OS
I'll offer $700.  Don't laugh...my A2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days.

	However, Thad, you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'PC', not 'UNIX-PC'.  Also note the strange cross-posting (as he
probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on.  If it *is* a PC (or clone), then the ""2C"" jumper would be
the correct choice.

	I've left the cross-posting in effect, since I'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)

I'm both.  I've made some $4k worth of PC products purchasing
decisions for one company I'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone.  (In a delicious bit of irony, an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that I suspect got my mailing address from these people.)
More is in the pipeline right now.

If they wanted to discuss these sorts of things, upfront is the
way to do it.

I'm looking for a Sharp 6220 or TI Travelmate 2000 for parts.  Mine has
a bad RAM chip on the motherboard and I want to see what I can get for
parts before sending it off to Sharp for repairs.  If you have one,
drop me a line.

Also, I'm trying to set one up for a friend who needs to read his old
5 1/4 inch diskettes.  Anyone have the pinout of the diskette expansion
connector on the back of the 3.5 inch floppy box? 

If you respond, please include a phone number. I can't always get through 
with email.
 
As always, 

Thanks,

	Hello.  I have (4) SIMMS for sale.  They are 1 megabyte
	each, and are of the 3-chip variety.  These are very high
	quality SIMMS, and are nearly brand new.  Best of all:
	they are ***60*** nanoseconds (the fastest available!)

	Please make an offer.  I prefer to sell all four SIMMS 
	to the same person (to lessen shipping costs), but if you
	just want one or two, please make an offer anyway.

	Thanks a lot: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu

I have a copy of this catalog in front of me as I write this.
It does have tons of qool stuff in it. 
My impression is that they try not to send it out to ""browsers"". It
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you. When you get a catalog there's a ""VIP Code"" you
have to give them ""to ensure your continued subscription."".
Anyway, if you want to get in touch with them, the company is

Personal Computing Tools
550 Division Street
Campbell, CA 95008
(408) 378-8400 
(They also have fax #'s and toll free #'s for ordering and tech support)

Please note that I am not associated with them in any way. In fact, I
have never ordered from them so I can't comment on their products or
service but the catalog is real and I am sitting here salivating over
it.

I've got 2 sets of sample cd's for sale

set one (2cd's)-geared towards house/techno/pop and rap

The 1st cd is all drum loops and drum sounds over 1500 of them
The second contains analog synths, basses, bass loops,  wavestations, vox
loops and much much more. 

The second set-

A variety of different sounds from new age to rock etc... kind of a
sampler cd..(pardon the pun)

Both have never been used and I can supply a list of categories for the
sounds if someone is seriously interested.

I'd like 130 for all three as they were $200ish new...

""Bare"" = case, a power supply, and a motherboard (with RAM and a coprocessor).
Everything else is yours to add as you like.

The motherboard:
    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU
    - 64kb SRAM cache
    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $120 alone)
    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1
    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS

The case/power supply:
     - Standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
     - Room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).

*New* Micronics CPUs often command a several-hundred dollar premium
over clone motherboards because they are US-made, use high-quality
components, and are known to be both very reliable and compatible. They
have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and Zeos at various
points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages of Byte or PC
Magazine if you want to see this price differential for yourself.)

Price: $450 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply. The board is fully guaranteed. Email for further details
or for any questions.

Thanks!

I think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person you're taking action against.  It seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this
person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim.
It really depends on how much money you're out.

If I am wrong about any of this, someone please correct me! ;)

Great for forms, envelopes, labels, small things, etc. that you just
can't do with your microcomputer.

Built like a tank, but not big nor that heavy.  A classic compact
electric, with padded storage bag.  No scratches, enamel paint chips
or dents.  Cloth ribbon, 2 colours.  Will accept best offer near $70.

(Selling for a friend, so these are her instructions not mine.
RSVP to this account, though.  Make any other offers anyways,
I'll pass them along.  A single sheet-feeder for the Macintosh

""Bare"" means what it says. You get a case, a power supply, and a motherboard
(with RAM and a coprocessor). *Everything* else is yours to add as you like.

The case/power supply:
  
     - Standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
     - Room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).

The motherboard:

    - US-made Micronics 8-slot motherboard with Intel 386dx/25mhz CPU
    - 64kb SRAM cache
    - 4mb 80us RAM using 4x1mb simms (worth $150 alone)
    - Cyrix 83D87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
    - Norton SI 6.0 rating of 26.1
    - Latest version Phoenix BIOS


Please do not post/email saying ""but I can get a Taiwanese SuperClone
386/90 for only $9.95 including a free toaster!"". I am *certain* you can
find a cheaper Brand X board without even breaking a sweat. *New* Micronics
CPUs command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are US-made,
use high-quality components, and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible. They have been OEMed in systems sold by both Gateway and
Zeos at various points in the past. (Check out the ads in the back pages
of Byte or PC Magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself.)

Price: $495 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply. The board is fully guaranteed. Email for further details
or for any questions.

Thanks!

There is another oven available for those still interested. My mother

Her's is strictly microwave, no convection, and is in equally good

I just received a music software WinSong for Windows and found that it needs
a MIDI/sound card (Sound Blaster Pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
features show up. As I don't have the plan to add a sound card now, I am 
putting it here for sale. It's listed $79.95 on April issue of WINDOWS 
magazine and I paid $84.95 as the total. I am asking around $70 with shipping
included.

WinSong for Windows:

Composer, sequencer (tape deck), and Juke Box all in one.

It's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move
and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.

It's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.
Up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward
and stop.

It plays music on any MIDI compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,
saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.

You do not need to be a musician to use this software. The on-line manual
is handy. For musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect.

Almost NEW (one week OLD), unregistered
$70 (including shipping) OBO (please be reasonable)

I participated a promotion by a company called Visual Images. 
They sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award. They mislabled my address and I did not receive my package
until one month ago. I was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package. So I wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund. They never return my letter. I was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package. I immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund. The package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect. I attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.
It took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,
but they refused to take any responsibility. I spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call
yet. But I was able to get their address from their front desk.
Should I just go ahead and send the package? Or should I waite until
they call me back?

I know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company. I would like to know how they got their money back.
If you have similar experience, please advise me.

Just to inform the readers of newsrc Sony has just introduced a new DATman,
the TCD-D7 which is smaller and less expensive than the D3.  Also, the D7
has a coaxial jack which the D3 lacks.  Oh, the D3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
the new model coming out, I suspect the now obsolete D3 will be selling for 
even less.

	Considering that you can get a brand new Sounds Blaster

My girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer
needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit.  It's one of
those where you pop in the lens case filled with solution and the
lenses, press the lighted timer button and let it cook.  No stains
(of course -- if you've owned one of these, you understand), maybe
a little dust on the cover.

Best cash offer, or equivalent worth in used CD's or Betamax tapes

Items for sale.....

This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth
which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...

Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended
			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring
			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four
			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm
			film.

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.
			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is
			_not_ included.

Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.
				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not
				included. The voucher is good for all 3
				locations, but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and
			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as
			usual.

I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell
the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. 
Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is 
only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them 
back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

According to reports, if you don't have DOS yet, and don't have any
utilities (QEMM, Stacker, PCTools, Norton, ...) then DOS6 may be worth it. 

For people who have DOS5, and some sort of utility, DOS6 doesn't offer
much. You'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able
to create, however. :-)

He is probably referring to the DOS version.. the dos versions is up

It really doesn't strike me as very funny. It is rather indicative of what
a crisis their economy is in. I imagine they are in desparate need of
markets to sustain industries and people which are nolonger under central
control of the government.

This is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  If there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
After this, any updates will be by E-mail *ONLY*.  The entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  So if you want to get in
on  this, be sure to bid now.  All bids must be made in *AT LEAST*
25 cent increments.  Buyer will pay shipping.  (Unless you have any
particular fancy, it will be US mail 4th class special, with lots of
padding).  
All dragons are bagged.  The condition of them vary quite a bit, 
so I've come up with my own condition system.  Some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
*
Condition ratings - Usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
Excellent - IE-""As you find them in the store""
Very Good - Still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
Good      - On down the line
Very Fair/fair - indicates lots of use (But still ""decent"")
Poor      -  Indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).  
A * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing (usually the insert)
I'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the
final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until
the bidding stops)
*
Again if you have any questions, ask away.

The only option you ""should"" jumper is the drive select, shown as ""4C32C1""
above.  There is also a drive power-up option jumper (elsewhere on the
drive's board) but the odds of that having been unset are slim.

Since the 3B1 ""normally"" has only one HD, you would jumper betwwwn ""C1"" to
select the first (possible) drive address; if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3B1, then jumper between ""2C"".

Subject: TCD-D3 DAT Walkman For Sale
Summary: I am backing out because someone is selling me another
Keywords: Digital Audio Tape Sony TCD-D3 DAT Walkman
Organization: Purdue University Engineering Computer Network
Lines: 64

        I recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused Sony TCD-D3 DAT
Walkman, having found someone else who has a unit I personally prefer (and am
paying more for).  However, it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it
is quite rugged, and many people out there swear by it.  (It's probably the
most popular walkman-style DAT machine out there.)

        Anyway, the guy selling it is Bryan Davis (bdavis@netcom.com), and
here's what he told me:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is what is included:
        - TCD-D3 DATman.
        - (2) RCA to Stereo 1/8"" plug cables.  One for analog input, one for
          analog output.
        - Optical digital I/O cable (one lead for input, one for output).
        - A copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase.  The
          unit is still under factory warrantee.
        - AC adaptor/battery charger.
        - Rechargable battery.

I paid $750 + tax for it so I hope you don't mind if I keep the 60 minute
tape it came with (I have some samples on it!).

[By the way, he spent at least $100 too much for it, unless he's including an
 extended warranty, which is advised for DAT machines, since it costs about
 $300 to replace the head when it wears out, and it probably will within 5
 years if you use it a lot.. -- davisonj]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        I'm not going to quote my sale price for him: that would not be nice.
Send him mail and ask him what he wants.

        Again, I've used the TCD-D3, and I have to say that I can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is.  I've been using one for a little
while, and although I had some problems with it recently, I should also point
out that the particular one I was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been _used_ during that time.  (This is the same exact DAT machine
that was lugged around the U.S. and Canada to record the Jazz Butcher
Conspiracy for their recent live album.)

        Bryan Davis says:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in S.F who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported
problem.  My problem is that everyone I know already has one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        'nuff said.

        The reason I'm not getting it is that I found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono-plug SPDIF I/O instead of optical (I don't have any
optical ports on my equipment, but you, the reader, might), and it also has
some other bells & whistles that the TCD-D3 doesn't.  (I am also paying more
for the alternative.)  Note that phono-plug-to-optical SPDIF adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one.

        Of course, it has SCMS.  All consumer decks do.  (So do Sony Minidiscs,
by the way.)

        Anyway, if you're interested, get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.

""Jack Previdi"" <p00020@psilink.com> writes, in reply to Dorothy Heydt
reminding us that advertising is not done on Internet:

	   As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.
	   Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,
	   many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial
	   use of Internet is no more.

Jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial
purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  Business communication is
okay.  Advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.

	   Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	   by our innate good taste and no have no ""administrator"" to 
	   guide(?) us.

I suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
it didn't want.  You may belong to the public library, but that
doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb
the other patrons.

You're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many
academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which
they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
advertising) follow.  There are Secret Masters here, just like
everywhere else.  They're not as obvious as the ones on Prodigy, but
they're here.

No doubt at some point the Internet, like everything else, will become
grotty enough to carry advertising.  At that time I hope it is
confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like
misc.writing.

 I'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. The group is Sanford/Townsend
the name of the album is 'Smoke from a Distant Fire' (I think). This album
came out somewhere around  1975-76, and I believe was the first album produced
by Kenny Loggins after he and Jim Messina broke up.

If you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it, great. If
you don't want to part with it, but are willing to copy it onto cassette I'd
love that too.

Thanks

JK

   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale. They are actually
Seagate's ST412, MFM, full height,  has the IBM logo and black face plate. 
 
  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 6.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order. 
 
 $30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5), 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs, this is for you !  It's cheaper
than a floppy drive !

ALL,

Finally cleaned out the storage room and have the following items
for sale:

             C-64 Computer
             2-1542 Disk Drives
             1351 Mouse
             all cables
             lots of software (mostly games)

The computer and drives work (hooked it to the TV to test)
except for sound-evidently the sound chip is gone. When GEOS
was loaded, the mouse would not respond, so assume it is bad.
Could be used for the games, or for spare parts.

If interested, would accept any reasonable offers.

Send replies to ihlpl!rsbrd or call (708) 979-8816.

here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space.

IRWIN suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as
you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before
you can format it again. Anyway, I have some new, preformatted tapes for
IRWIN 250 tape drives.

   Both Space Ace and Dragon's Lair II ($750)
-----------------------------------------------
 
   These games require a Sony 1450 Laserdisc player.  The
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal Laserdisc movies on it as well.  I have one which I
will sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one
complete system or $500 if you buy both systems.
 
    I currently run this into my entertainment center.  I have
it housed in a PC computer case with with its own fan, and 
power supply.  I run the audio into my stereo system, and the
laserdisc runs directly into the T.V..  I have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons.  First person who buys both
games will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.
 
    If you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  The graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.
 
    Everything works perfectly.  The laserdisc player has an
RS-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications.  The Laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them.
 
    If you are interested please email me.

   I have a few the original IBM 10Mb harddisks for sale. They are actually

  Each disk is checked and formatted with DOS 5.0. It can be doubled to 
20Mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire.  Have the original IBM
foam fitted boxies and anti-static bags. I am not sure if they were ever 
used, but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order. 
 
 $30 each plus shipping cost, (about $5), 
 
  If you have one of those old IBM XT or PCs, this is for you !  It's cheaper

Title says it all, I'm after a Vectrex system. If you have one and want
to get rid of it let me know.

I can offer cash, or possible trades with Megadrive and SNES games.

Cheers

My little Nash has sat for about a year (had been running), but now I must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me.  Here are the
details of the car:

1958 Hardtop--Exterior condition:
     Rocker panels rusted out at weld points, no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points, back battery box, etc.  Missing front bumper,
     front pan dented up, one weld popped in front.  This is for the most part
     a solid, restorable automobile.

     Interior Condition:
     Missing original steering wheel, has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels, seats need reupholstered, general fair condition.

     Mechanical Condition:
     Had been running, but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which
     I have) also have extra parts such as complete long block, extra steering
     shaft, etc.

For a car that has not been touched since 1958, it is in solid shape.  It will
obviously need some work, but will make a good project.

PRICE:  Well, this is a tough one, I would like to get around 800.00, but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it. If you 
have things to trade such as tools, toys, cameras, comics, cards, etc., 
anything easily movable to Florida, I may consider that as well.

Time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses, cameras and photo stuff
that's not being used.  Some are gems, some are mundane.
 
 
Minolta AF 50/1.7 lens for Maxxum cameras.  New lens, but I guess it'd
be best to call it a ""demo"" since I did not get the literature, box or
warranty cards.  $30.
 
Vivitar 2X converter for Nikon F or AI lenses.  Pretty cute ""flip back""
tang so it will work with all manual focus Nikon lenses - and bodies.
It will even couple (and double) a non-AI lens to an AI body.  $15.
 
Pentax 50/1.4 screwmount lens.  Well actually it's a Super-Takumar which
is what they all were back then.  Very mint condition.  $25. Nice hard
case for this lens $5 more..
 
Alpex 135/2.8 lens.  Beautifully made, all metal construction with fine
optics.  Minolta mount.  $25.  Another hard case that fits this with
strap can be added..call it $7 more.
 
Vivitar 283 flash.  The one that made Vivitar famous (until the 285
eclipsed it).  Tilt head, removable sensor, variable auto exposure.
$30.
 
Universal ""Roamer 63"" folding old ""bellows"" camera with leather case.
Uses 120 or 620 film, 100mm F6.3 lens.  Kinda cool articulated shutter
release.  Decent shape.  $20.
 
Weston 540 lightmeter.  Nothin super fancy, but it works well, and is a
good cross check to built in meters.  $7 with case and strap.
 
And finally..the ""gems""
 
Pentax Auto 110 camera with 24mm F2.8 lens.  This is the little
(and I do mean TINY) SLR that Pentax made.  Has interchangeable lenses,
but try and find the 20-40 zoom, true through the lens viewing with
split image focus, and completely auto exposure.  $70.
 
Olympus 35RC rangefinder camera.  A really cute little camera with 42mm
lens (F2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure, self timer etc.  I
think this was the predecessor to the XA - and it's nearly all metal.
I won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell.  $60.
 
Olympus OM-1 with flash shoe, leatherette case, 50/1.4 Zuiko lens, and
Tokina SD (Super Dispersion) 70-210 lens.  These are all in very nice to
mint condition, except for one little ding on the OM body near the film
advance lever.  Lenses are perfect, and the Tokina is a very compact,
and sharp lens.  $225 for the set.
 
 
That'll do to clean out some of the stuff.  Feel free to offer on this
stuff, although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it..
 
For more details call or email.

Hey,

collection.  I am interested in buying any in good condition.  I am 
particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ] 
transformers into one etc...  I am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending
upon the model, size and original cost etc.  I will also pay airmail postage
and packing.  I am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots,
rocketships, micronauts etc... There is only one catch.  I live in New

someone can help me out.

HE IS A CROOK.  DON'T DEAL WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Please Help:

I am looking for Dana Weick.  A month ago I made a deal with him over the
net.  I was to sell him some memory, in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu.
I thought the deal was great, so I went on with it.  

I sent him the memory COD FOR $100.  He was then suppose to send me the cpu.
I receive his COD payment on 4/8/93.  He send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4/16/93.  It has been two weeks, and I didn't receive the CPU.

I send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship, or
what address he send it to (to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail.)
He never reply my mail.  

I finally resorted to calling him in Arizona.  The first call didn't get
throught, I got  an answering machine.  I left him my number.  He didn't reply.
I call again the next day and he pick up the phone.  I asked him if he had
send out the cpu.  He said yes, but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to.  

He said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.
To my suprise, He never called.  I then send him some more email messages, he
never reply again. (strang, when the deal was being made, he reply to every
of my message, now that He got my memory, He won't even reply to me.)

Now:  I am still calling him, but he won't pick up the phone.  I am also still
      emailing him, but he won't reply my mail.

So if any one know this DANA WEICK, please contact him.
he can be reach at:
			Dana Weick
			4238 W Las Palmaritas
			Phoenix, AZ 85051
    (602)925-6123 in the day time this is his business number.
    (602)842-2145 in the evenings this is his home number.

(602) 925-6123 (days) (602) 842-2145 (evenings)

I would prefer US Mail, 2nd Day Priority (it only costs $2.90)

The CPU is brand new, install it correctly (meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins) and I'll warranty it for 6 months.
Thanks

****ON 4/8 I SEND HIM AND SAID...
that I got the cod payment.
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
>Is the CPU sent out yet?
****HE REPLIED.....ON 4/9

Glad the COD payment got to you OK, the CPU has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it.  Be *very* careful when you install it, be careful of static discharge,
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation.  The chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards I won't be real
sympathetic! 
 
If you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed, 
DON'T GUESS!


********************************DANA WEICK UPDATE:****************************

I call him sunday, his wife Debbie picked up the phone.  She said that he was 
busy with his kids, and he would call me back in 10 minuets.  Half an house
went by, Weick didn't called.  I called him again, and his phone was discon-
nected.

Since this post,  I have numberous people who mail me saying that this DANA
WEICK have ripped them off.  We got do something about this guy.  He has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now.  And he is getting away
with it.

   After hearing about the McGovern House story on Paul Harvey I never had any
idea how much it was worth.  The autograph is on a Senate Pass card
and is signed 'John Kennedy.'  I don't remember if it was signed 
'Senator John Kennedy' or whether or not it was dated, because I haven't
looked at it in quite a while.  Currently it is in a safety deposit box.
I would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as Christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit. 
If you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send
me an e-mail expressing your interest.  I will see what I can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers.

	I did slip and went 5,000 miles without changing the oil once.
* tires have 20,000 miles, lots of life left (probably 30,000 to 40,000)
* front brake job at 84,000, back brakes are still good
* engine/trans/drive train in perfect condition - everything works,
	nothing needs replacing, next tune up scheduled at 120,000
* body is good - left tail light is cracked (I'm trying to find a used
	one - dealer wants $172!), two long scratches and a ding on the
	hood (vandalism?), a bunch of stone chips on the front of the
	hood.  Official Mazda touch up paint included in the deal.

This car is extremely reliable, even better than the Toyota Corolla it
replaced.  Besides the tires, brakes and maintanence items, the only other
parts that have been replaced are the headlight bulbs.

Selling because my wife refuses to drive a car without an automatic trans.
And she wants a station wagon with a sun roof, etc, etc.

I have the following items for sale.

Rabbit PIP tuner
SoloFlex-like gym
Scanner (800 Mhz)
CB Antenna
Blazer/Jimmy running boards

----
Rabbit PIP (picture-in-picture) Box.

This device when used with a VCR tuner will allow you to
have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen.
The you can press SWAP on the remote and the small picture
will be swapped with the main picture.

The only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel
tuner. This means that the box itself cannot tune higher
than cable channel 36. However, if your VCR tuner is capable
of tuning higher than this, then you simply tune the VCR to the
channel desired and then swap pictures (assuming the alternate
picture is channel 36 or lower) and it will work fine.

Original cost: $149
Will sell for:  $75


----
Running boards for Jimmy or Blazer

Brand new black running boards for the S10/15 models. I purchased them
and realized that I could not use (after return period expired) them 
because of wheel trim that I have installed on my vehicle. 

Original cost: $125
Will sell for: $ 65

----
Regency MX4200 20-Channel Scanner
Recieves cellular frequencies (800-950 mhz) along
with 7 other bands. Brand new Ni-Cad battery pack.

Original Cost: $249
Will sell for: $135

----
GYN/Plex model 2000 workout Gym, similar to Solo-Flex 

This gym is similar to Solo-Flex in that it uses resistance
bands to increase the effective lifting weight. It is all black 
and made of steel. I have an extra set of bands that I purchased 
that will be included.

Original cost: $349
Will sell for: $125

----
Big Stick CB Antenna for 27 Mhz band.

Will sell for: $30

Because of weight or or other difficulty, last 2 items 
for Atlanta area only please.

I will share non-COD shipping charges. 

Thanks

Manny

Most comics are in near mint to mint condition, are bagged in shiny 
polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  Shipping is
$1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  

I will trade for other comics as well as computer equipment, video
equipment, etc...  Let me know what you want to trade!!

The front covers should be available from Sony.  Check with a local car
stereo shop.  You will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  I 
don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

As to deterring theft:

When I worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a Sony 800
number.  We would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  Most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use.  If theft occurs with these decks, notify Sony.  Serial
numbers do catch theives.

Just a thought,
Michael

or best offer.  Has inputs for tape 1, tape 2, CD, phono, video and tuner.
Separate listen and record selectors.  Bass EQ, subharmonic filter and mono
switch.  High quality volume potentiometer.  In excellent condition, with
original boxes and manual.

Sony D-88 portable Diskman
========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's.
You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works
well,
but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned,
etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With
carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best
offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.

   Is there anyone out there with a copy of the driver for Turtle
Beach's Samplevision program that allows you to use a Always Tech
IN-2000 SCSI card to do SMDI dumps between your PC and your
Peavey DPM-SP / SX / SX2 ???  

   This is normally only available directly from Turtle Beach but I
was just wondering if there was someone who got it and couldn't
find a use for it..

   If you have a copy let me know!

The Multi-Game Hunter is capable of copying both SNES and Genesis game 
carts to standard IBM PC formated floppy disks. The games can them be played directly from the floppy disk. NOTE:IT does not require a PC

Full color on-screen icons and menus make operation for the MGH so simple
that even a child could operate it.  Options can be selected simply by choosing the selection with the game controller and pressin a button.

Add a Game saver adapter to your system for more game playing power.  The
Game saver allows you to save your position to disk in almost any SNES game!
Reload your saved position any time.  Enable it's slow-motion feature for those really tough games.

For more control over game play, We have the Game finger software.  The
game finger software can give you unlimited lives or warp you to new levels in
your favorite SNES games.  Bring back to life those really frustrating games.

Also if you know how to program 6518 6502 ASM code you can create your own
SNES demos or games.

i installed dos 6 last week, and had nothing but trouble afterwards.
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata, and it does not seem to like to work with NDOS (norton 
dos 7.0).  other probs include:

set pcplus=d:\pcplus for procomm plus no longer works.
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either. (mostly shareware)

i now have uninstalled dos 6 , and dos 5 works just fine.
are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont?

OK.  Instead of holding an auction, I have decided to compute prices for each comic (after many suggestions).  These are the most reasonable prices I can give (not negotiable).  If you would like to purchase a comic (or group), simply email me with the title and issue #'s you want.  The price for each issue is shown beside each comic.  First come, first served!!!  There is no more bidding.  Meet my price and it is yours.  I can be reached at this email address:

02106@chopin.udel.edu or
02106@ravel.udel.edu or
02106@bach.udel.edu or

NO MORE HAGGLING ABOUT THE PRICE!!!!!!!!
LOTS OF COMICS FOR $1, $2, or $3 LOOK AT LIST!!!!!

Shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics.  For more than 3, the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase (I may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail).

For all those who have bought comics from me, thanks!!!

All comics are near mint unless otherwise noted (my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors, not me!)

Hello Neo-Geo owners (and non-owners who couldn't resist the title;)),

I was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games.  I
mean, buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive.  $184.99 is
a little too much to be spending on each game.  But ahh, the quality...
Now I can get them for about $100, but that's still a lot.

Right now, I have:

Crossed Swords
Magician Lord
Baseball Stars 2
Fatal Fury
Nam-1975

I am interested in buying more titles.  If any of you have any interesting
trade ideas, please let me know.


Thanks

I hope you realize that for a cellular phone, you need to subscribe to a
Cellular carrier, and it usually takes at least one working day before
the service is available to you. Only then you can find out whether 
the phone is working.

Lines: 273

I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two,
but one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for
$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the
base configuration, depending on what you want:

- 386 16 MHZ CPU.
- 8 meg of ram.
- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!
- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!
- Ethernet.
- 5.25"" floppy drive.
- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.
- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).
- Unix System V.3 installation.
- Networking software package (TCP/IP).
- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).

I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or
serial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of
three ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.

This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally
designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.
This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable.

It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8"" wide and 2"" deep.

I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.
Shipping is way too much hassle. Call if you wish, or send email.

Organization: Moondog Software, Sunnyvale, CA.
Keywords:

I have an Altos 2000 System V.3 Unix system for sale (I actually have two,
but one's for me). Several years ago these well-known machines sold for
$30,000 for the base configuration. This particular one has much more than the
base configuration, depending on what you want:

- 386 16 MHZ CPU.
- 8 meg of ram.
- Fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!
- A multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!
- Ethernet.
- 5.25"" floppy drive.
- QIC 24 cartridge tape drive.
- 170 meg ESDI hard drive (either Micropolis or CDC, or both if you want).
- Unix System V.3 installation.
- Networking software package (TCP/IP).
- Development system software package (C compiler and libraries).

I am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! If you want another Ethernet or
serial card, add $50. Additional disks are $100 each (I can install a total of
three ESDI drives). I would consider a trade for a SCSI DAT tape drive.

This box would make a great BBS system or terminal server. It was originally
designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.
This is NOT a PC! It was designed to be a Unix box from the start, and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable.

It's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8"" wide and 2"" deep.

I am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.
Shipping is way too much hassle. Call if you wish, or send email.

Howdy All!

I have recently converted to Microsoft Visual C++.

I no longer want my Borland C++ 3.1 w/Application Frameworks product.

This version is about 6 months old. I have all of the manuals, disks (5.25""),
etc. It is licensed to me but I will transfer the license to the purchaser
under the accepted terms of the Borland license agreement.

I also have a copy of the books:

""Developing Windows Applications with Borland C++ 3"", James McCord, Sams (39.95)
""Using Borland C++ 3 2nd ed"", Mark & Lee Atkinson"", Que  (29.95)

I'd like to do is sell it all to the highest bidder under the conditions listed
below.

I'll ship C.O.D. to anywhere in the U.S. via the shipper of your choice
(provided they are local to me), and I will pay the COD charges (you just pay
for the shipping).

The list price for the product is about $750. I have seen it advertised for as
low as $500. 

I will accept the best offer over $375 (plus shipping as described above) which
is 1/2 the list price, plus, I'm tossing in the 2 books listed above (which are
a $70 value).

I will hold the bidding open through the weekend and close it sometime in the
evening of 4/26/93.

Please reply via eMail. Only serious offers please apply. No, I will not
consider anything for trade, nor any offers less then $375 as I consider it a
fair price.



Regards,
Steve.

Computer Equipment Garage Sale:

I've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me.  I've put together a list and
indicated what I think each item is worth.  This is just my estimate, and I
am very open to any offers, including trades.  I'm currently looking for
some CD-ROMs that will work with a Mac CD ROM player CD Caddies, HD floppy 
disks, any used Macintosh software, a 387-33Mhz Co-Processor, or basically 
anything you have lying around (cans of soup, the neighbor's cat, etc...)  
Make me an offer, no offer will be overlooked... 
I really want to get rid of this stuff...

Ok, Here's the list:

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  Conner Model #CP-3150.  I bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.  Unfortunately, I can't seem 
	to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.  The
	guy tested it with his PC, and printed out a copy of the Norton Disk 
	Doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (I'll send you a copy) 
	I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to 
	him. The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) 
	so maybe that's the problem.  I was quite disappointed that it didn't
	work so I'm trying to minimize my losses.	~$45

52 Meg 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive. Conner Model #CP-3150.  Same situation as above.
	I bought both of these drives from the same guy.  Despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive.  Same report from NDD
	(I have one for each drive) will be included.	~$45

40 Meg SONY 3.5"" SCSI Hard Drive.  SONY Model #SRD2040A.  The drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed.  This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) and
	had a stiction problem.  Well, repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash (yes, metal scraping metal) which
	was not too pleasant to listen to.  Still the SCSI controller
	card is in good working order, and can be used for parts, or a 
	project.	~$20

65 Meg Seagate 5.25"" HH SCSI Hard Drive.  Model #ST-277N.  I originally bought
	this drive, because it had a small stiction problem, and I though that
	I could fix it.  Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,
	and that it was a controller problem.  (motor controller wasn't sending
	proper signals.)  Well, after taking the controller off the drive, 
	looking at it, and putting it back together, I realized that I
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller.  I tried to solder it, but I'm not that good
	at soldering so I couldn't do it.  Worked perfectly before I messed
	up.  I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed on
	me.  Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,
	worth well over $1000.  (Claris CAD, MS Word 5.0, Think C,
	Excel, and many others) 
	I think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable.  You also get all
	the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate)  I only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive.  I was really angry
	when I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.  I just don't 
	have time to play with it any more.	~$65

AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.  This is for use on digital phone systems.  If you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.  I
	have some tech documents on it.  Is supposed to be the same thing as an
	AT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.  It seems to be in  
	working order (passes self test perfectly OK).  I have no idea how 
	this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.

Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.  I haven't tested this one out yet, but if anyone 
	is interested I will get it tested out, to make sure that it works.  I
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board, but then I spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 
	another controller chip.  When I was looking around to buy one new, the
	prices were around $100.  I will guarantee this to work.	~$65

CGA Card.  Half-Length. 8-bit.  Wasn't working last time I checked (although
	I think I was using a bad monitor)	~$5

5.25""	360K Floppy Drive.  IBM Drive Type 1355.  Guaranteed to work, 
	because when I took it out of the PC, it was working!		~$25

5.25"" 360K Floppy Drive.  Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.  Guaranteed to 
	work.  Came out of same PC as above.	~$25

5.25""	Floppy Drives.  Can't guarantee that these will work.  I don't
	even know if they are low or high density drives.  I don't have
	any method of testing them.
		Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.  There's another
			number on it: 2626-361723.
		Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.  There's also
			another number on it: H3649-101457
		Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.  Virtually identical to the one 
			above.
	Each Drive ~$10

3.5"" PS/2 Drive.  These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but I
	think it works.  Not sure if it's high density or low density, but I
	suppose someone who is looking for one would know.  Model Number
	DFL413C04A.  I think these things are expensive to replace.  ~$35

MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.  I've got three of these, and I have no way
	of testing them.  Two of them are 8-bit cards, and one is a sixteen bit
	card with a floppy controller built in.	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for
	the 16-bit card w/floppy.

Interesting cable.  Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.  That is,
	standard nine-pin to VGA 15 pin. Made by Hewlett Packard.  Part No.
	D1181-80020		~$10



I've sold stuff like this before, and it was a huge success, with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore.  I 
usually ship through the U.S. Postal Service (haven't had any problems yet) 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.

Well, that's all folks.  As I said before, no offer will be refused.  If you 
can convince me to give OCit to you instead of throwing it out, TRY!  I hate
to throw away stuff...

Items for sale.....

This package was bought throught a award give-away company. I attempted
to cancel my order before I received the package, but I was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. I know the truth
which I would never get my $697 back, but I wish to get my money back as
close as possible. Here is the describtion of the package...

Nishika 3D camera	It takes very good picture, never been opended
			or used. It came with wide angle flesh, carring
			case, film, and a instruction video. It has four
			lens and created a 3D effect on a regular 35mm
			film.

Jewelry			It came with the package as additional gift.

Bahama vacation voucher	The voucher is good for two RT airfare to Freeport.
			The users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night. Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is
			_not_ included.

Las Vegas, Reno, Orlando	The voucher provides one RT airfare, and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights.
				Meals, ground transfer, hotel tax is not
				included. The voucher is good for all 3
				locations, but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once.

Cancun, Mexico		The voucher provides one RT airfare, and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights. Meals and
			ground transfer, hotel tax is not included as
			usual.

I paid $697 for the whole package. So try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer. Details would be provided by request. I do wish to sell
the whole package at once. So if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers, I don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
If you are interested in the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

If you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards. 
Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as I did. There is 
only one award which will be given away. So don't bother even to call them 
back, if you are really interested, you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price. And you could receive the package within a week ( I waited three 
months to get my first and final packages). Also, they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company. So why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.

do not pay $40 for floppy drives.. they are about $40 new.
also, you do not need documentation for floppies. installation

I'm selling an Adaptec 1640 SCSI controller card.  I works with Microchannel
machines only.  The data transfer rate is very fast (I get about 3meg/sec with
my SCSI hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns RAM on a card.  It's
a SCSI-2 true bus mastering/DMA device, and goes for around $329 bought new. 
I'm including the new EZ-SCSI software for speedy Win 3.1 performance and easy
configuration.
I'm selling it for $225, and I'll pay the COD shipping.

Please email me directly, and either give me your phone # with your offer, or
I'll respond with mine.  I hope we can both benefit from the sale of this
Microchannel device; it's a great product!

********************[ PC Game For Sale ]******************

Waxworks by Horrorsoft/Accolade (5.25"")		   $30

By the same folks who brought you Elvira I & II.  I played
Elvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is
roughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,
especially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This 
is not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is
quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is 
no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles.

The really interesting thing about this game is that it is really 
broken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported
with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps
you inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must 
escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into
Jack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper
victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and 
meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to 
stop the almost indestructible zombies.  

Over all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a 
creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.
I heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.

	this one.  Please email me an offer!!  (it's the standard black 
	component style cd player)

3.5"" 1.44 meg floppy drive
	A real IBM floppy drive with cable and mounting case.  I paid $40
	a couple of months ago.  The drive works (as last time in).  I
	would like to get the $40 back for it, but OBO applies.

5.25"" 360K floppy drive
	I'm sure someone out there needs an extra 360K.  It works great and
	is nice and quiet.  Again, please email offer.

RC10 remote control car
	4 time world leader design.  It was just overhauled.  It runs great,
	even though the body if not all that pretty.  Has new engine in it 
	as well as racing pinion.  The chassis is nicked up from hard running,
	but it's still a great car.  Does not include electronics.  Comes 
	with monster truck conversion kit (wheel arms already installed)-virgin
	truck body and bumper etc.  Car+kit=$100+20=$120 OBO...make an offer!

D&D stuff...you name it, I probably have it.  Please send email regarding what
	you want...or a request for sale list.  I hate to part with any of it, 
	but needs are needs, eh?  

Misc CD's
	Alice in Chains - Facelift    $8
	Skid Row (self titled)  $8  both obo...really.

Box of computer printer paper...paid $20 for it, make offer.

There are many people want to buy my Kodak autofocus carousel projectors
but I don't have lenses or remote to sell.  They prefer to buy a projector
with all accessaries.  So I have to post another news asking for lenses
to fit those Kodak slide projectors:

I am willing to give away Singer Caramate II or Singer Caramete SP (
w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 HR
bulb) try to trade for Kodak projector lenses.

Each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 Kodak projector lenses
depend on the focal length.  I will pay for the shipping for Singer 
projector (viewer).

Since I don't need those Singer projectors, if you have some 35mm SLR system
you don't need, I am willing to do the trade as well.

Subject: Panasonic dot matrix printer: $165 complete
Reply-To: jmatkins@midway.uchicago.edu
Organization: University of Chicago Computing Organizations
Distribution: usa
Lines: 41


I would like to sell my dot matrix printer so I can upgrade to inkjet.
It is a ""Panasonic KX-P1124 24 pin Multi-Mode Printer"".  Here are the
stats (from memory and the manual):

-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.
-  VERY fast (up to 192 cps) printing in ""printer-controlled"" (as
	opposed to Windows driver-controlled) printing
-  Bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
-  5 fonts (""courier"",""prestige"",""bold ps"",""script"",""sans serif"")
-  Epson LQ-2500 and IBM Proprinter X24 printer emulation
-  Can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by
	friction feed
-  Front or bottom paper feed
-  6KB buffer

I will send a sample document and a printed GIF/JPEG file to anyone
who wishes to send a SASE.  With purchase (prepaid, please!), I will
include the following accessories:

-  Manual
-  cable (Centronics)
-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4"")
-  FREE copy of Windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if
	it is included with Windows)
-  FREE unregistered DOS shareware program ($2 registration, I think)
	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
	from DOS

The last two will be on a disk (either size).  I am asking for around
$165, but I am open to any (reasonable) offers.  I am a college
student, so I cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer.  This price
includes all above items, and shipping (probably UPS) is included as
well.  I have the original box, but only one of the original Styrofoam
end pieces.  I will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel
too!!).  Worked fine getting it here.  The whole shebang might not fit
in the original box; I will figure this out after the offers come in.
Email any questions and offers.		-Jon.

I have had a Nikon L35AW since 1988. Unfortunately it is no longer
made. It is a P & S sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. It
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions. It takes AA batteries (hooray). It has the solid,
heavy feel of old-style Nikons and has taken all the abuse I have
been able to give it. This includes a lot of water (rain, river and
sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger. Shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera
did. This is my, ""never be without a camera"" camera. The current
water-resistant (Sport Touch I think is the name) model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed.

Not true.  Dial 811 and listen to the recording.  If you get it, then your

wanted correctly the first time.  These records are in PERFECT

	I have recieved a few questions as to what 12"" are.  I guess I
should elaborate.  (???!!!! am I that old?)  They are just
maxi-singles on wax.  If I am correct most beat mixers still use this
form of record.  This is probably the kind of person interested in

	As a matter of fact D.J., it does make a difference.
	Almost a half million new users joined the Internet last year,
	many of them are commercial businesses. The ban on commercial
	use of Internet is no more.

	One should have the breeding not to post commercial material
	on an account provided by ones employer or school, unless the
	provider of such account gives permission. (HA!)

	Those of us who pay for Internet access are constrained only
	by our innate good taste and no have no ""administrator"" to 
	guide(?) us.

      Agreed.  I have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net

      The only small problem that I have had was with UPS rather than

Subject: Spring Cleaning Sale!
Organization: Pacific Systems Group, Portland Oregon US
Distribution: na
Lines: 71


Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some
isn't.  Please read carefully.


In the MAKE OFFER department:

	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade
	manuals.  Best offer.

	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.
	card.  Best offer.


In the FOR SALE department:

	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because
	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,
	I have used it effectively in ""tape studio"" applications for mastering,
	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7"" reels.
	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse
	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,
	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but
	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit
	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got
	it--works perfectly.

	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).


	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff
	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I
	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the
	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.

	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.


	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen
	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too
	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very
	straight and in excellent condition.

	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)
	available for an additional $40.00.


TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,
so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:

	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate
	DOS and Workbench.

	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.

	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).

	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 
	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless
	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a
	good ST-4096 in the deal.

	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.


This is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off
the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point.
Email responses, please.

I've got 7 episodes left on *Beta* for Sale at US$8 each (neg.), or
for Trade 1-for-1 for movie on Beta or a used CD; or, a package deal
for $50 or whatever you care to propose in trade -- e.g., all for a
set of good stereo headphones (e.g. Sony V6 or V7), an Apple IWII
sheet feeder, a good used FM/Cassette stereo ""walkman"" or a hotel
coupon(s) for free stays FOB New York City (guests coming!)).  The
remaining collection is as follows:

         8 - Charlie X
        11 - Dagger of the Mind
        12 - Miri
        17 - Shore Leave
        20 - The Alternative Factor
        29 - Operation-Annihilate!
        33 - Who Mourns for Adonais?

Numbers indicate episode numbering on the tape boxes, for those who
are keeping track of what episodes they're missing in that manner.

RSVP for summaries, if necessary.

The tapes are all in excellent condition in the original packaging.
All have been played at least once, but most have been played ONLY
once, and NONE have been played more than twice. Running time: ~50
min. ea.  (Unedited, uncut store-bought originals unlike those in
syndication; all have *incredible* Beta HiFi sound!)

I also have the following SF and Horror movies on Beta as well; US$10
(negotiable) or Trade (1-for-1 swap for movie on Beta or a used CD):

        The Bride (Sting, Jennifer Beales)
*       Buck Rogers Conquers the Universe (Buster Crabbe, Constance Moore)

RSVP for my larger Beta movies/music trade list, or find it on Misc.forsale!

PS: For those of you who may wonder, Beta is alive as a pro/hobbyist
format ... there's life beyond the corner video store! (-;

For Sale ...:
 
        Hewlett Packard DeskJet 500 inkjet printer.
 
        o Perfect condition both internally and externally
        o Comes with two FULL ink cartridges
        o Less than six months old
        o Comes with all original packaging, manuals, cables
          and software
 
        This is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost
        alternative to a laser printer.  It prints with the
        quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both
        the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,
        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
        of toner).  The printer prints at a maximum of 300*300
        (D)ots (P)er (I)nch (D.P.I.) on many different types
        and sizes of paper, including envelopes and
        transperencies.  Printer prints in both landscape and
        portrait modes.  Printer can accept up to two
        cartridges giving it things like more memory or
        additional fonts.  Printer works excellently with
        Windows and DOS and brings TrueType to its full
        potential.
 
        I originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  Make me
        an offer, but I would prefer to stay in the $300.00
        range.  I will pay the shipping to anywhere in the 
        continental U.S.A.

        call Kirk Peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.
 
        Thanks!
 


        P.S. The printer will work with any computer that
             can accept a standard parallel or serial
             connection.  (That is, IBM, Amiga, etc.)

The original four door sports sedan


Arctic Blue metallic with gold alloy plus-1 wheels (Rial 15"")
Goodyear Eagle GT+4 racing tires (mud/snow-rated)
3.0 liter, 186 HP, fuel injected engine w/Stahl headers
adjustable gas shocks all around (Koni,BYK)
4 speed stick, 4 wheel power disc brakes, sunroof, PS, AC
Listen-Up installed hidden speaker stereo w/subwoofer

208K miles (yet much better condition than most cars w/100K)
Meticulously maintained: all records, 3K mi oil changes
Faded paint on top, otherwise excellent exterior and interior.

The car has required no major repair work in the more than ten years I have
owned it. It has never failed to start or broken down, even in the coldest
weather. This has been an extraordinarily reliable and economical car, and
shows every sign of staying that way. Yet it is an absolute thrill to drive
when you take it to secluded twisty mountain road! I sell it now,
reluctantly, since I just succumbed to the convertible craving and bought a
new Miata.

Since I have some free time while looking for a job I thought 
I would offer Linux on disk and tape for those who need it.


NOTE: I am offering this service for EXPERIENCED users who 
require no support.  Simply put I am just a disk shuffler.  If 
you think you will need support I HIGHLY recommend  
Softlanding Linux System (SLS) directly.  They provide an
excellent product at a decent price with support.

I am the lazy mans service, for those who don't want to spend 
4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies.  And 
those who don't need SLS support and opt to go it alone.

What you get... each disk is $1.50(5.25) 
                             $1.75(3.5)       (14 disk minimum).

For sale: Toshiba 3300SL notebook computer. 

Specs:

	80386SL (64K cache) @ 25MHz, * 8MB * RAM, 80 meg 16ms IDE hard drive, 
	1.44meg floppy, 5.9 lbs w/ Nickle Hydride battery installed, edgelit
	greyscale VGA display, PS/2 mouse port, external keyboard
        port, 1 PCMCIA port, external expansion port, external VGA port, 1
	serial, 1 parallel ports, socket for 80387SL numeric coprocessor
	(user-installable).   Memory is expandable to 18meg.

	Voted Editor's Choice by PC Magazine.   An expansion station is
	available from Toshiba; Axionics also makes one that is more
	economical.
	

Power conservation options: 

	User definable hard drive powerdown period, screen dimming,
        auto stepdown of CPU speed (to 12.5, 6 MHz) after definable interval,
	etc.

Comments:

        Purchased locally at Micro Center in Columbus, OH 7 months ago.  All
	original packaging, receipts, and manuals are included.   Under
        warranty.   The keyboard on this machine is the best I've seen; I
	prefer it to the keyboard on most desktop units. I typically
        get 3-4 hours of battery life.  The battery recharges in 2 hours to 
        full charge.   The machine is quite speedy; I run OS/2 2.1beta
	on it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless
	you prefer MS-DOS 5.0 (included).
   
        I'll include a padded carrying case, also made by Toshiba.

Price/terms:

	$1900 (semi-firm), certified check.    If outside of Columbus, I will
	pay for COD shipping.

NNTP-Posting-Host: po5.andrew.cmu.edu

I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.  

I purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
We didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,
even in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are Jim
Morris T-shirts.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
colors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
event or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could
pay off big.

I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a
shirt.  I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power.

Please help me.  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need
the money.  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  I will give
you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.

All prices are negotiable.

Please email tf26@andrew.cmu.edu and tell all of the clubs in the area
about this deal.  Once they're gone, they're gone (cause I am not a
business.)

I'm sure that the Motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing
has always mystified me.  $400 is the price of very good, new
dual-band, fully synthasized HT.  Yes, yes, I know Motorola
HTs are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based 
indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll
still work.  But just how often does that come up?  Why are hams
willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied
dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  Note: this is not
a flame; as I said, I'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.
I'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  I would have guessed
that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-
bander to a ham, no matter how durable. Just shows you how wrong
*I* can be.

Hi All

I have a Korg DVP-1 for sale for $300.00 + shipping.  For those who've not
had the pleasure:

It is a MIDI controlled (no keyboard of it's own) rackmountable digital voice
processor.  What can it do with your voice?  It can pitch-shift it (change the
notes you sing).  It can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one
time).  It can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible.  This works well for a ""computerized"" sounding
singer, or robot voice.  For those of you who just thought about that, yes -
you can do the voices from Robo-Cop, and the old ELO lead-ins with it, and yes -
I'm a little red-faced to say that I tried those specifically.  For an input,
it takes both: XLR (3-prong mic) and 1/4"" cables.  For output, you can have
a combination of the original-input-only, and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired).  It has preset
setups, which you can edit and save for your own preferences.  It has a couple
of light scratches, but does not look bad, and works flawlessly.  Even when we
don't use it in my music, it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio.
The manual is included.  I never got around to getting rack-ears for it, but
it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading, so it's not beaten.

Hi,

Since the original buyer found out he couldn't use this modem
for his Mac (I beleive I mentioned that it's an internal in my
former post), the modem is re-available now.  This modem is
SupraFaxModem V.32bis.  If interested, please e-mail.

Thanks!

PS: I am sorry I already lost those e-mails stated interested
    in this modem.  If you all are still interested, please
    e-mail me again.

    CORRECTION: I check the diskettes, it only contains the PC/TCP
     kernel, no applications. It is only good for people who needs
     to run their own LAN applications that uses FTP PC/TCP kernel

Recently I got a case of Hot Shots '93 cards.  Unfortunately I had
not planned on keeping all of them.  I sort of got stuck with the
case.  (I'm not going to mention any names, though.)

So, I am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).

If you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let
me know.

The set has 250 cards.  Each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress.  Some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.
99 percent are gorgeous, I feel.

There are 4 subsets:

Girl, Girl, Girls   1 through 9
Promo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
Emperor's All-Stars   269 through 277
Stripping Empress   260 through 268

Also, I am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.

Oh, and lastly, I have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the
company changed their mind.  None of these cards are easy to get.

Anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please
drop me a line, as I am most eager to sell a bunch off.

Oh, and if you are interested, I also have 1 set of Hot Shots '92
left, and about 2 sets of California Dreaming cards as well.

And lastly, I have promo cards for all of the cards I have
mentioned, and holograms as well.  Not a lot, though.

Hello,
  I am looking for the Coleco Tablehockey games that were popular
in the 70's.  The games that I seek have straight slots for the
defenseman, not the S shaped slots.  The players are attatched to
rods operated with springs.  If you have a game(or games) that
you would be willing to part with, please send me an e-mail
message at U34815@uicvm.uic.edu.  Price is negotiable and
I would also cover shipping if you are out of state.  I am
part of a league that plays on a regular basis, the CTHL (The
Chicago Table Hockey League), and need a game to practice on.
Also, the league itself is always interested in purchasing
games to expand itself.
                                  Thank You,

I recently purchased an IBM monochrome vga monitor from Mike Damico. The
monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. Mike's address is
apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. If anyone
knows how to contact Mike and could help me find him I would appreciate it.
I am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
but it would be a lot more useful to me if I had the cord as well.

Hmmm... Interesting. What do you mean by WALKING distance? I lived in
Moscow for 21 years, and if I am 5 minutes walk to Belorusskaya
subway station, I CANNOT be walking distance to Kremlin. Unless
1 hour of walking is what you mean. By the way, what is

	I have some brand-new shrinkwrapped boxes of 8"" floppy disks that I
would like to sell.  They are all 3M disks:

40 (4 boxes of 10) SS/SD 8"" floppy disks
60 (6 boxes of 10) DS/DD, W/WP 8"" floppy disks

Misco is selling the SS/SD 3M disks for 25.90 for a box of ten and they are
selling the DS/DD 3M disks for 31.90 for a box of ten.  I will take the
best offer I can get for the disks (as many boxes as you want).

	I also have a quantity of 8"" floppy disks that 
some people were getting rid of, probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
system.  All the disks are used and most have labels on them, but they all 
appear to be in good physical shape.  However, I make no guarantees of the
quality of these disks.  Here are the statistics:

Quantity	Make	Type

10		3M	Single side/Double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record
66		Memorex Single side/Double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record

I will accept the best offer I receive for the disks and I'm willing to sell
them off in different amounts, the minimum being a box of ten (if I get no
offers on these disks I would considering throwing them in with the new
disks I'm selling above). 

I also have a head-cleaning kit for 8"" disk drives for which I will take
the best offer I can get.

All sales are final.

I would prefer to ship COD and add the shipping costs onto the total order 
cost.

Please send E-mail to formula@athena.mit.edu if interested.

	I will be in Boston (Cambridge specifically) working this summer
and am in need of a place to stay. If you have a room to sublease, or
anything of the sort I would appreciate a mail.
I am a 20-year old white male and am very flexible. I can adapt to a smoking
or non-smoking environment. Access to the 'T' would be nice, though I will 
have a car thus need a parking space. 
I would need this from late May or early June until aproximately end of July.
Any responses welcome.

Okay, okay, Norman himself isn't actually for sale.  BUT:

I have two Saturday Even Post's, both of which have Norman Rockwell
illustrations on the front cover.

October 29, 1960  --  with candidate Kennedy on campaign
   -- has, obviously, a Norman Rockwell of Kennedy on the cover

November 5, 1960  --  with candidate Nixon on campaign
   -- And here we have Nixon.  He's not a crook...

These are both in very good condition.
Let me know if you're interested, and to what tune.  ($$)

Oh, dear.  Let me be the first on my block.

You have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the Usenet groups:
you're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise (of _any_ kind; people frequently get flamed for announcing
they've got a new book out.)

I don't know whether this is an official Usenet rule or just a long-
standing custom, and it doesn't make much difference from a practical
point of view.

So please don't do it again.

And all you others, who are even now taking keyboard in hand to flame

I have a set of four 235-60-R14 Big O tires that I had on my 1988 Thunder 
Bird. We bought them and then traided the car in. They would not give me 
anything for them so I had them taken off. We drove about 2,000 miles on 
them. They are 40,000 mile tires. They are sporty looking low-profile, and 
take corners realy well. If you are interested please contact me at (208)384-
9236 OR DUSMADSO@IDBSU.IDBSU.EDU I am in IDAHO. USA

Organization: College of Engineering, Univ. of Wisconsin--Madison
Lines: 35

   I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fast
printer with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paper
path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back
(a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
print out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program
all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
ever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
and default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I bought
it three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it's
own modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since I
own an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

    I'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.  COD orders must pay
all shipping and COD costs.

I have used JVC's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
I have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  The unit is one of the best that I have seen and listened to, but
I am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.

Features include:
	17 Hz - 20,000 Hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	AC adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets, 5 user programmable
	RCA connections and cord
	JVC compulink capability (cord included)
	programmable from remote
	intro, random, repeat playback

I will include a Discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's
12v DC to the 5.5V DC that the unit requires.  I had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits, (JVC makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at Radio Shack etc).

I paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.
I will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.

Well, I'm not sure I'd go quite that far, but I agree that Motorola
gear is of better quality.  The question is how much that quality
is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service

>This radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without
> an antenna.

Ok, great. But how often does that come up?  How good is
""good enough"", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?
A good ham-quality HT is maybe $500, while a commercial
quality one is maybe $2000. Is the increased reliability and
performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?
Only the individual involved can answer that question, and each
ham has to decide for him/herself.  If Motorola quality is worth
4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. But I'm amazed
that folks make that choice. For, me, given that I've got $2000 to
spend, I'l pick the Yaesu ht and a nice new HF rig every time over
a Motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  To me, ham-quality
gear is ""good enough"". To each his own...

I have an old Optonica tuner and integrated amp that I no longer
use.  The integrated amp section does not work right now but should
not cost much to fix.  I believe that it is just a Chip.  I have 
used it as a preamp and it works great!

This is a very nice looking and well built set.  They both are low 
profile but the amp is rather heavy.

The tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.

The amp is rated at 75w/ch.

These peices went for about $850 New.

I would like to get $150.  obo  for the pair. 

If anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, I have had an estimate
done that it should cost less than $50 in parts.

Please email me if you are interested.  I will be moving back home for
the summer and will sell it back there if I do not do so here.

Heise model 710A pressure meter. This is a precision 4-1/2
digit meter measuring 0 - 15 PSI (absolute) in .001 psi
increments.  Case is in extremely good shape, and can be used
as a stand-alone meter or panel mounted. Brass fitting (looks
like standard 3/8"") on back. Operates from 110 VAC.

I'd like $50 for it, or make an offer. It is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer, which is what I've been using
it for.

Jammer !

 Dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen
 maar een evenzo duidelijke mededeling hieromtrent :

 Aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder
 vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is,
 wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik, Marcel Engelbertink,
 niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk ROLEX.

 Enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet
 meer helpen.




 For all the foreign people who can't even understand dutch ?!? :

 In spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's, I announce that I
 don't have any information available any longer and I won't use
 the trade name ROLEX anymore for those fake models.


 Yours fakefully,

I was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels
were to make the radio useless, and thus discourage theft (that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)

If those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs, or even sold at all,
then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great.

I personally would be unhappy, if I bought a radio like that, thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value, and the covers were
sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.

  Sorry for any confusion I may have created.  The disk did come out of
a VS2000 and I would like to use it in a IBM PC clone.  The reason that I
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because I saw the drive (XT2190) mentioned
in a for-slae notice.  I had asked for info before but didn't receive
any replies.

Hi,

	I have a Humminbird HDR200 Depth Sounder for sale. It
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
	
	All parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. It is even packed in the original box it came in. There
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. In fact, the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
So it led a ""sheltered"" life. The transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

	It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2"" hole in a bulkhead
(that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 

	I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the NMEA 0183 information. This little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable.


	It is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, I paid 150$.


	The first 80$ takes it, or best offer.

COD is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00
for a brick. Or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a COD it's fine till a stop payment is made. There are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. Even with
merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards, 
chargebacks, no return policies and getting the wrong item, etc.

About the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trust....someone who has been around for a while.

I have a UREI 527A 27-band (mono) Equilizer for sale.  Anyone who knows
this unit knows it's been a recording studio standard for years.  It's a
pretty straightforward unit, with balanced ins and outs.  Power supply caps
were recently replaced, and I added XLR connectors (which can be easily
removed if you prefer, as I mounted them on a bracket outside the case). 
The unit is in good shape, and is sonically very clean.

I'm asking $225 + UPS shipping.  They're going for $250 generally.  Make me
an offer.

It's basement cleaning time.  This stuff has got to go.

I have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes, around 20 tapes/box.  They are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up.  They've seen
very little use.  If anyone wants these bad enough to ship, they're yours
for the cost of shipping, the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee.

I have a lot of serial cables.  I have all kinds, ribbon, shielded, long,
short M-M, M-F whatever you want.  Most appear to work well with PC serial
ports, but I will not gaurantee that.  Tell me what you want and I'll do
the best I can to match.  1.50 ea or 10/$10.  Shipping included.  No CODs
under $20.  (You want to pay a $5 COD charge for a $1.50 cable?  Go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead, it'll be cheaper.)  I believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center.  They appear
to be in good condition and the ones I have used have worked well.

I also have a 15 KVA Exide UPS with batteries that needs minor repair, probably
a logic board.  It weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high.  I think
they used to run a Prime system off of it.  Best offer over $75, but you 
need to come pick it up.  Use this to run your house from your solar panels.

I will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff.

My company maintains a 20,000+ mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies.  The method you are using to
""seed"" your junk mail, isn't really effective.  Bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be ""cleaned"" by the NCOA, which if you've
moved recently, will revert back to the original ""xxx Cool"", and in large
mailings, there will likely be a dupe of you, and they'll pick the first, and use the
others for future mailings.
 
BTW, our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a MS Windows utility product in the $100 range, and is available through
Direct Media in CT., at $0.10 per name.  Please let your direct mail
marketing rep. know about this..  Thanks.

Greetings:

Here is a list of items for the 3B1 which I am selling:

dBase III - Full dBase III multiuser Development/Runtime for 3B1!
Microsoft Basic Interpreter - Gives 2.5 Megabytes RAM available!
Microsoft Word - Full featured mouse-based multiuser word-processor.
Microsoft MultiPlan - Nice multiuser spreadsheet program. 
GSS-Chart - Nice graphical program for creating business charts.
LPI-C - A robust C compiler.  I'll throw in LPI-DEBUG:single-step,alter vars.
AT&T Electronic Mail - Very nice Office-based front end to mail.

I'll take $500 or best offer for the whole bunch.  I bought all of these
new in 1985, and paid over $2,000 for these excellent programs.

I'd rather sell them together, but don't hesitate to make me an offer for one.

I'd consider possible trades.  I'm interested in the following 3b1 Hardware:

Ethernet Card with or without Software
Tape Backup
External Expansion Unit
Upgraded P5.1 motherboard (Or just info on who can do the P5.1 upgrades)
ICUS 2nd hard drive upgrade kit
AT&T 513bct, 610, 615, or 4415 terminals with the UNIXPC-style keyboard

Make me an offer.

PS:  I can get UNIX PCs with 40M Drives and 1M Motherboards loaded with 3.51m,
cnews, smail, trn, rn, elm, nethack, gzip, HDB, and a couple other things
for about $550 each plus shipping.  Let me know if you're interested.

PPS:  Priam D519 150M Hard Drives (Exactly same as Maxtor 2190, but faster)
are on sale for $280 thru a vendor in LA (Number not handy, write for info)
This is a VERY good price for these drives, the largest, fastest HDs
available for the UNIX PC.  (Note, to fully use the entire 150M, you'll
need the P5.1 motherboard upgrade [WHO DOES THESE?], and a WD2010)

Summary: Will trade 350Mb for ~300Mb IDE, or sell for $450
Nntp-Posting-Host: isis.msstate.edu

Distribution: na

This drive is less than one year old.  The cartridges have all been bought
since then.  All is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
Due to a change in system use, I now need a large, contiguous drive.

Offer includes:
	SyDos 44i internal drive
	SCSI adapter card and cables
	All original documentation
	Software
	All original packaging
	8 cartridges totalling over 350Mb (no bad sectors or defects)

The installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.

I will trade for something near 300Mb IDE, or sell for $450.
I will also consider trading for 4 4Mx9 30 pin SIMMs at 70ns.

Subject: IN CASE A DEAL IS A LEMON ....

Hi to all.

Since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, I'd like to bring
this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal 
became a lemon?

As I understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,I am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item I received is out of order. The seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that I paid if I send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad. Is this reasonable?

Basically I would like to believe the seller tells the truth. Also, I am positively to say that I've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
the thing. My assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.

I would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my
e-mail address.

I know there is such a risk that you could lose money. But, how can we make it
enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?
