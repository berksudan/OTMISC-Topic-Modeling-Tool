I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last
May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes
the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet
must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed
manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my
truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts
rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet 
says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""

Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the
gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about
55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third,
the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should
point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a
detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They
dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity""
reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does.
Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times 
so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being
shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between
stabilizer and control arm fell off).

Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What
really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt
to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for 
them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new
Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never
buy another Chevrolet.

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

Don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
  make a claim. They'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
  when they leave you in the lurch.

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals 
  showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I
  know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a
  and some local governments.
The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can
  tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make
  AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most
  drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
  this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called
  extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost
  universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an
  increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
  a riskier driver to insure.
Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!

Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer
discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
commission. That's another story for another day.

In article <foo> Brad Thone <C09615BT@WUVMD> writes:
Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

A question for any high-mileage Audi owners out there: I am

reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  The car's owner
claims the car is in good condition.  My question is: how
reliable are Audi 5000s with mileage that high?  Would it
be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  Any problem areas that
I should look out for?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Post responses and/or

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. The solution is simple. Sort of
like the advice my Aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything
except your elbow.

If you have pieces of ring, con rods, valve heads or stems, just reach into
the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation
of those large bits and pieces. Anything you can't remove with one hand 
through the hole in the block may safely be left in place.

Summary: My air vents don't work on my 71 Skylark
Distribution: usa
Organization: Purdue University Physics Department
Lines: 31

I have a '71 Buick Skylark with 148K on it.  I bought it in California, and if
it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these
Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.

The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is
stuck in the ""vent"" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air
flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't 
live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.

I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think
the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.

Two questions:

	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than
	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?

	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
	a way to ""fix"" this?

THanks for any advice/info

However, I feel that you have missed the point of the previous postings (see

Many people are interested, but have no input.  I will restate that your last

I have a 1986 Acura Integra 5 speed with 95,000 miles on it. It is positively
the worst car I have ever owned. I had an 83 Prelude that had 160k miles on
it when I sold it, and it was still going strong .  This is with religious
attention to maintenance such as oil changes etc. Both cars were driven in
exactly the same manner..

  1. It has gone through two clutches (which are underrated.)
  2. 3 sets of tires (really eats tires in the front even with careful align)
  3. All struts started leaking about 25-30k miles
  4. Windshield wiper motor burned up (service note on this one)
  5. Seek stop working on radio about 20k miles
  6. Two timing belts.
  7. Constant error signals from computer.

  8. And finally. A rod bearing went out on the No. 1 piston seriously damaging
     the crankshaft, contaminating the engine etc. When the overhaul was done
     last week it required new crankshaft, one new cam shaft (has two) because
     the camshaft shattered when they tried to mill it. The camshaft took 4
     weeks to get because it is on national back order. 

     Everything on the engine is unique to the 1986 year. They went to a new
     design in 87. Parts are very expensive.

No way would I ever buy another Acura. It is highly overrated. .

They are also unsupervised.  With proper supervision, they would not be
throwing rocks.  If parents cannot provide the minimal supervision needed

To anyone with experience about Honda Civic (EX or DX) or Saturn SL1:

I would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive
they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the
dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image.

Another question:  what would I expect to pay for a Civic EX coupe with
automatic, air, and an AM/FM radio?

Mail to the address below or post to this group.

It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-
accelerate an Integra.

But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,
closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.

You've just got to know what's important :^).

i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k.  you get 3yr/36k *free*.  so what you are buying is
2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k.  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warranty...why?  design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up
to, keeping customer happy, etc.

this is an interesting point.  some people are not really buying the coverage,

I agree about the durability of the old TH400 trannies from GM.  While I 
never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave 
the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires 
grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would 
shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double 
stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite 
impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine.
Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large
chains.  Oh yea,FYI:    Pontiac 400 ci bored 0.04 over

  Oh yea, I also pulled the 'Cocktail shakers' (weights) from the front
  and removed the lead pellet from the accelerator pedal. (Damn US regulations)

Hello all,

I know that after market sunroofs may have left a bad taste in some of  
your mouths, but I am really interested in finding a ""good"" brand if one  
exists.  Please let me know if you have heard of any makers with a good
reputation (few failures, no leaks, that sort of thing) and whether or
not you have had first hand experience with that manufacturer.  Who is
generally regarded in the industry as the ""best"" (price no object) maker  
of power sunroofs??

Carrying in the glove box is not covered...I'm not sure what I was 
thinking there. It _is_ legal in Oklahoma. 

On inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
from the ammo, it is legal under Title 19, Chapter 44, Section 94(9? I
forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the US Code. This,
unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
stupid) under that state's law.

Gee, and I thought Federal Law overrode state law...

For the information of those not ""lucky"" enough to live in the city of
Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,
it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance
unique (I think) to the city of Austin.

Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here.
Recovered freon is not required to be ""purchased"" from the car it is
withdrawn from.  As a matter of practice, some shops here are charging 
a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
is reintroduced to the system.

Just another quality service from an _Enviornmentally Conscious_ city.

You can avoid these problems entirely by installing an oil drain valve in
place of the bolt.  I have one on both of my cars.  There have been no
leaks in 210,000 miles (combined miles on both cars).

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

I'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
question?  Is the reflected signal ""shifted"" at all from the
act of being reflected?  If so, wouldn't it then be easy for
the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
sources?

i have no experience with State Farm, but i think it's important to
differentiate your experience from a typical ""accident.""

hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
for them to stop covering you.
that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
which may be more indicative of claim patterns.

My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon.
Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions
on this car (or line)?

Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only)
reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the
line.

She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its
electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong,
even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them-
selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder
restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along.
She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite
dissatisfied with its lack of power.

The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering
a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000
line and the Mercedes would be helpful.

Price is not an impediment.

Yes this is a common problem.  The leaks occur through the seal of the 
taillights.  Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does
not have a recall for it.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.

>2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

There is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it
Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it
under warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would
not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; 
$90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket
which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the 
covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.

very annoying.  Don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay
more later.  Considering how common a problem it is I hope every one
complains to Ford.

Well, I was just in your position and I drove all three and liked
all three.  It was a toss-up.  I marginally went with the Pathfinder
based on reliability and looks.

I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.

OK...

5) How about a fuel gauge that *really* told you how much fuel was
   left.  Like, ""can I make it to where the gas is $1.14 or should
   I get gouged right here at $1.35?""  Accurate to the tenth of a
   gallon would be great.

gee.... is it 1999 already?

Yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different
on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. The suspension will most
likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. From what has been printed on
it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have
the modular V8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see
Also is far as styling goes from what I seen is good, a return to tradition.
C scoop on the sides and roof line much like a '65 or '66 fastback.

Agreed!  I own a Mercury Villager and I'm very impressed with the V6 and
the AT.  In the past, I've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(I owned
an Aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the AT in the
Villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance.
 
BTW, Consumers Report in their report on the Villager, alluded to some
funny noises from the AT, I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything
unusual.

In a previous article, gwm@spl1.spl.loral.com (Gary W. Mahan) says:

>Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
>what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.

It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is
usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car
with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
poorer Cd. 

To calculate drag use this formula:

D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S

Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the
pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 

Note that power is:

P = F * v

Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
is velocity (ft/s). 

Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for
force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power
result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd. 

So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top
speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)

101 mph

Sorry to dissappoint.

The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the
Buick Co. when Durant was there.

When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and
others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful
Chevrolet company.

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM!
That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company
Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!

After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM
board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given
the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.
(If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloan's book, Chevy
division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the ""passenger
car division"" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)

I have had my Probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where I purchased
the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  The second time,
after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and
made it *much* better.  However it now makes a ""scritch scritch"" noise on rough
roads, and *still* squeals when I open/close the window in wet weather (anyone
elses's do this?)

>>Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!

I got two keys with my car, but only ONE remote-entry push-button thingie!
But then, I bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  I think it may have been a
repossession ... so I'm not surprised something was missing :-(

I am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where

about notifying the National Traffic Safety group as well as Ford.  Those little
""you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep"" buttons are

Well, I guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  When someone
hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big American car.  They may
not associate the sound with a small ""jap car"" style car (like the Probe is).

>>Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 
>Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.

The mudflaps help a lot.

>>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)

I have always been a 5-speed guy.  Almost every car I've ever owned has been
a 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I
(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty
high-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
torque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I'm getting 35 mpg on the
highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I 
probably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been
around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn't have the
""control"" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out
to be very convenient.  It's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in 
""we-like-to-control-your-life Massachusetts"" :-)


>>No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)

Shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  I've gotten them to fix the
worst of them, but I fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will
be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.

>>Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

On my 89 Probe GL, I got about 40K out of the original Goodyears,
and had driven the replacement tires (Bridgestone) 50K miles when
I tradeed the car.  The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe
look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  But the car handles
very very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
surface.

>interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically

Definitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The
car has a ""much more expensive than it actually is"" look and feel to it.

>Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,
>but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly

Having driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension ""interesting"".
The car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet
the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and
feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.

>>If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
>>that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides

Well I wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the
person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As
mentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, ""consider the back seat
as a parcel shelf"".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I'd not
have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).

>>Also, there's a lot of glass

A/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out
a REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That ""lots of glass"" you
mentioned is what gives the car the ""very good visibility"" reports you
see in all the write-ups.  Most ""sports/sporty"" cars don't have that
good visibility.

The complaints I've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on 
the GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent 
exhaust system.

I was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.
Since I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, 
I was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still
waiting.   :-(

Yes.  I was pretty amazed when I had my car in for some touch-up
adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy
for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  They 
did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

I have to agree that they seem to have some QC problesm.  But I seriously
feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.

In rec.autos you write:

>if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
>it can't be half bad..  :-)

This McLaren auto-transmission (I still think it's only half auto,
but You may be right) has NOTHING to do with Your GM, Chrysler, Volvo,
or whatever auto transmission. It's a normal manual transmission
gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do
the shifting. 

That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out 
minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions 
(Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift,
either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage
with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.

As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 
'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an
advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the
loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But
then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.

There's no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to
point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so there's
no need for a flame war.

I sold my '86 Sprint last April with 95k on it.  I'd driven it since
the previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to
light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.  
My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,
so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah,
if you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased,
but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce?
That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!  Has
anyone ever driven the 'Turbo' variant?  Just curious...

Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:

rec.autos.tech

is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design,
construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely
inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.

rec.autos.sport

is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving
automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply
to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints,
spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are
largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are
inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment.
Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid
advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)

rec.autos.driving

is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles.
Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert
your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.

rec.autos.vw

is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership
of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis,
Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing
list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence
of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many
different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be
created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as
a mailing list.

rec.audio.car

is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however,
the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and
so is mentioned here.

rec.autos.antique

is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years
old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)

alt.hotrod

is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the
rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing
list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing
performance vehicles.

alt.autos.rod-n-custom

also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar
American hobby of customizing older cars.

alt.autos.karting

for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.

rec.autos

is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.


Crossposting:

Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on
the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear
in all of the newsgroups listed.

Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on
Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is
appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular
audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector
articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are
almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact
that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or
rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.

Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually
inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is
truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To:
to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.

Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in
particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of
radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.

Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about
the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in
rec.autos.

It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of
articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to
misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these
three.  The life you save may be your own.

Distribution:

There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to
(partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution
field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve
as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.

The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing, 
the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia,
New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the
following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article
headers, and on article content.

1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford
Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in
either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange
reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)

2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which
your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences
between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise,
all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel
injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These
differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear.
Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant
spread of misinformation.

3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting;
in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas
Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition
of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used
abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos
reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.

4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when
possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can
(canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state
abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted
to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put
""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated
values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so
you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely
to be supported in your area.

The Dangers of Overgeneralization:

To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article:
Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is
true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a
1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly
different from those in Idaho.

The Need for Adequate Specification:

When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information;
e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year,
model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be
quite useless.


Concerning Lemons:

At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or
two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by
announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all
`brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from
the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they
cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful
information.


Concerning Flames:

As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most
likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how
to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section
of this posting):

If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a
minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and
you'll get exactly what you deserve.

If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can
cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe
bald, unsupported assertions.

Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.


Asking the Question:

It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please
send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to
end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest
I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses
to this request'.

Answering the Question:

If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang.
Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on
defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time --
it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly
address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see
your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and
self-righteous.


Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:

Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of
them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings
about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them
ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is
difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some
of these topics include the following:

1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con

2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of
    radar detectors.

3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.

4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why
    rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue
    about what constitutes a `sports car'.)

5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's
    right to own and operate a radar detector

6)  `Buy American' discussions

7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates

8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible

9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?
      [when I have a complete, accurate answer it will be added to the
          commonly-asked questions article which is also posted monthly.
          Until then, please don't waste bandwidth on this topic. -- rpw]

In defense of the drivers, who are in the right lane.  Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.  

Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake
cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.  

BTW, If no one else is around, then GO FOR IT!.

My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model.
It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the
mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I
have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine. 

I'm quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said ""once
it's broken in it will feel more powerful"". I had been used to driving a
Jeep 4.0L 190hp engine. I believe the 92's Land Cruisers (Land Yachts)
were 3.0L, the sames as the 4Runner, which is also underpowered (in my
own personal opinion). 

They are big cars, very roomy, but nothing spectacular.

GM has always screwed the rest of the divisions in favor of the

Firebird is a load of crap to keep people from realizing that they can
buy one of these instead of a Corvette and save about $10,000.

I like the idea of an Impala SS, but if they really wanted to impress

Shades of the Edsel! They had pushbuttons in the steering wheel hub

Yes. When i think Mustang, I think school-bus +  F16 motor. In
my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90
or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs
outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
junkyards.

I find it astonishing the CU or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
Mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. Ford should at least
standardize on the SVO rear brakes for all 5.0's.

Europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. It hasn't passed as
far as I know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
the US. Law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred
to the US) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. The things
you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more
professional attitude to driving. You just never see two cars
running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

You're wrong. GTI's  go this fast. Just kind of noisy, not the ideal

autobahn car. A lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
foot on the floor. How do I know? - when you're not making any ground
on the identical car in front of you!

>have no respect for their own lives.

If something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much
over 35. Driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. I feel much
safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical US traffic
because most people seem to be awake. I've never seen any driver reading
a book on an autobahn, I see it all too often in the US.

It just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody

There is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
Complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  It is
a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 Probes, so you 
shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  In my case, they fixed it on
my extended warranty (I just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  Having
removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, I think their estimate
was fair.

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a ""seriously handsome car with broad shoulders,"" I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus
is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...

I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker
than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.

Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is
beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to
say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
SHO anyway. 

I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
transmissions from all ""performance-type"" cars (like the 5.0l
Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
accidents each year. Autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
but they have no business in performance cars, IMHO.

i think you got it the other way round: the Ferrari flat 12 is a 180

true boxers.  don't know about the vw bug though, but i suspect that

To avoid paperwork associated with re-certification as a brand new car,

still a Stanza.

No, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

>Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?
Unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  If you plan on
paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
automatically covers rental cars.  Also, your own auto insurance may
cover rental cars also.

Most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  The
credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.

I have never rented from Alamo, so I don't know if they follow this
same practice.

>Is the beretta a good rental car?
Yes.  It is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and
acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  It will have an automatic
transmission, AM/FM stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power 
windows and door locks.

As you can see, I have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each.
The problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is
running about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year.

What am I doing wrong?

Within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:

Dodge 600 SE (Dodge's attempt at the American German car!)

$1,000 - replace head gasket
$300   - new radiator

Chevy Nova CL (Chevy's attempt at a Japan import!)

$500 - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.

Note also that the Chevy Nova CL (1987) has only 70 horsepwer!
Does anyone out there have a Chevy Nova with enough power
to get up even a small hill without knocking? Is there
something wrong with my car, I even use 93 octane gas!
(I have consider going to 110 octane if I can find it!)

Anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,
and what equipment is needed?

All gimmicks!  Stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive.
Eagle 1, Meguiars, Turtle Wax, and a few others are good examples.
The colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so 
apparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.

Never tried Liquid Glass, although I still have this sample they sent
me a few years back.

folks,

i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months.  i
am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can
be in a better negotiating position to purchase a '93 right when the
'94s are coming out.  i need something that can comfortably carry
2 adults, 2 kids in car seats, and 2 60-pound dogs.  i can probably
afford something in the 14k-16k range.  i am interested in the SUV's
but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford.
i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but
is above my $$$ range.  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range
but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down.  can anyone
offer any suggestions?  i am hoping for something a little more hip
than the traditional wagon, and the SUVs look like fun (we do a lot of
camping too).

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.

Like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.

I can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.
Thats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,
or on the street.

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
the 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

	I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple
strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut
going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a
tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?

	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening
the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry
will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom

Hi! This is my first time to post on this news group. Now a days , I have stucked at a certain problem. I have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.
   There is a engine warning signal on the dash board. While driving, this signal turns on, but not always. What does this mean? In the manual, they say ""Go to authorized mazda dealer."". It is really good idea. Don't you think so? 
  I wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. Is anybody out there who can give me same advice as ""authorized mazda dealer"" can give ?

Eliot is right about 2.2 liter engine in the second (and last) generation
MR2's. But the original guy did not indicate the year of his MR2. If it's a
first generation car (like my '85), it has 1.6 liter engine (or perhaps
same engine with a supercharger, if it's '87 -'89).
The sound he describes is common to any older Toyota engine I ever heard.
I don't know the relevance of his observations about oil changes, my simply
makes noise. Not all that annoying, mind you. But you hear it well when the
engine is right behind your left ear :-)

Hello,
 
I have a 92 Toyota 4X4 and in the last few weeks I have been getting quite
a few ""dings"" :( in the paint on the hood from rocks and debris off of the
road. I have never had any major problems with other car/trucks in the past
(maybe a ding once in a while). I went to the dealer and he said that it
happens all of the time and he recomended putting a bug deflector on the
hood. He said that the trucks, for some unknown reason, seem to have this
problem more than some cars.? 

It seems to me that either my luck is really bad or there might be a problem
with the paint (painted on a monday morning perhaps?). 
 
How well do these bug deflectors work for small road debris on trucks? 
 
If anyone has any experiences/suggestions please let me know, thanks.

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another
time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd
spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.

So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed
to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the
outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these
gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.

   Yes. Nobody is watching them.  If they get caught, there is no punishment
 at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
 with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
 what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen
 any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching
 him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would
 inevitably wind up dead early anyway.

   The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,
 he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-
 gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment
 industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our
 modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that
 we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.

  And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much 
 about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is
 the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!
 And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to
 whatever violent hate-promoting ""music"" and videos they like because no
 one is home to stop it.

  This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn
 than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is
 shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in
 school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when
 they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There
 is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will
 bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.  This is
 just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to
 whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.

Hey all,


I'm looking at buying a new car, but I'm confused about the insurance
coverage.  This also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  Does
anyone understand what the ""Limited Tort Option"" means.  Will it lower
my rates if I opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if I opt
to have it?  What does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  Is
it a good deal or should I ignore it?  I'm not the type to sue anyone
at a drop of the hat nor am I the type to report every little ding to
the insurance company as a vandalism claim.  Please help.



Thanks in advance.

As long as we're on the subject... Several years ago myself and two others
were riding in the front of a Toyota pickup heading south on Interstate 5
north of Seattle, WA. Someone threw a rock of an overpass and hit our
windshield. Not by accident I'm sure, it was impossible to get up to the
overpass quickly to see who did it. We figured it was kids, reported it and
left.
A couple of years ago it happend again and killed a guy at my company. He was
in his mid-fourties and left behind a wife and children. Turned out there was
a reformatory for juviniles a few blocks away. They caught the 14 year old
that did it. They put a cover over the overpass, what else could they do?
I don't think I'll over forget this story.

This makes sense(radar pointed down), because almost every train I pass head-on that triggers
my radar detector does so more just after I have passed the front of the engine.
I get a little of the reflections as I am approaching and the instant I get to
the side of the first engine the detector receives a fairly strong signal for
a short time. It happens with just about EVERY train I see.

Can anyone give me 1) advice on feasibility and relative costs 2)
references where I might learn more 3) Personal experience?

Please email

Does anyone know what the domestic content is of any of these:
Geo Prizm, Eagle Talon, Ford Probe

?

All are made in the US, but I have been told they contain mostly
foreign parts.  Please follow up directly to me, I'll post the
findings to the net if there is interest.

Thanks!

740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph. Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I
believe the Beetle corners better. 

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever.
I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.

Not sure how long the small shit-box Volvos last - too damn long. The worst car I ever drove was a hired 340. In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
from the 50s, without the character. The 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough. I ought to go
for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

They changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new
grille.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.

Interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a BIG
design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the
LEXUS and hence, they now join the pack.  I still wonder if much of
the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial AD campaign.

Personally, I like the Q without the Grille.

I'd like to see you use this method on a couple of semi drivers. If they see you,
they usually acknowledge by sticking their hand out the window with their middle
finger extended. Because it is also obvious to them that there is no clear lane
ahead.

And here's my two cents:

The best convertible for the money, IMO, is the Miata. Yes, it's small, but
you're buying it as a second car, I hope, so you don't need the cargo room
of a big car. It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car
ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates
like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

The targa-type cars are nice, but they're not real convertibles.

I couldnt agree more.  That is how it SHOULD work. People should also ALWAYS see motorcycles too.

I CONSTANTLY scan behind me (I have one of those wink mirrors) and two outside mirrors.  I actually spend just as much time checking my six (cops you know).

I still get caught off guard every now and then. 


Maybe I didnt word it right the first time.  What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)

Well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  My previous
car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. 
The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory
service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was
supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
nut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking
lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I
found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid
of the locking nuts. :-(

My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the
dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to
be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the
package and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems
with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did
have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire
balancing.

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a ""fun"" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently (if that's ""better"" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch""
but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Why crawl under the car at all? I have a machine I got for my boat that

excellent job and by moving the suction tube around, you can get more 
old oil out than by using the drain plug. I think I paid $25 at E&B Marine.
The oil goes into a steel 3 gal can - wait until it cools and decant into

Alright GM!!!! Finally my wishes have come true, Moby Dick with a Corvette
engine.  DOn't you think they should maybe spend the money doing something
about the lousy build/quality/design of their bigger selling cars?  This is
another example of why GM is in so much trouble.  If you're going to stick
the LT-1 or ZR-1 engine in a car, at least make it a nice looking one.

Subject: Re: electronic odometers (was: Used BMW Question ..... ???)
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine

I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The
design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat
ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit
difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The
secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint
of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid
exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used.
The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect
at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading
by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an
automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in
operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your
1993 RX-7!

The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions
under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and
velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to
collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the
drivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer
currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading
out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion
of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your
driving style, it could also provide valuable information from
actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.
I personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving
demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.

james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts!
never was a t'bird mentioned.  The discussion was about SHO's and
'stangs not being up to spec.  I do not know about t'birds.  I
only know that the specs quoted for the SHO by previous poster sounded
a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff.  This does not
in any way  disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it
a bad car.  It merely means that i think Ford could have added that extra
bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large
enough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not)
and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it.

How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the

extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and
for some the peace of mind knowing you won't have too many unexpected expenses
is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than
a year....how many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs....

It may work for some people......

This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time.
The ""breeding"" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at best
extremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should have
the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary 
anywhere a threat is imminent.

My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back.
The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not before
having trashed the car.

On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel
for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my
car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant
walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. 
Needless to say, I immediately packed-up and left.

Watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73

I agree with Gaia. Even though the Saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind.

In my opinion, getting the PowerTrain warranty is enough. In my case, that's be
cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,
 etc.) I could do myself. I just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.

Plus I think the extra 3 years of 24-hour RoadSide Assistance must be worthe so
meting. I opted for the 5 year plan for $375.

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The
pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold
weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the
fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply
suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will
cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. 
If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to
get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your
vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any
thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:

1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off
2)	a flashing red LED

These two are basic to a decent alarm system.  
To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.
That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target.
But, then there's always car-jacking.  
Why is life so confusing?
I hope I helped somewhat.

recently-manufactured locomotives have wheel-slip detection systems
that use frequencies shared with police radar (i forget which band).
these will set off your radar detector if you get close enough, though
i believe the range is pretty short.

BTW, railroad police sometimes use radar to check for speeding trains
(just like regular police check for speeding cars), although the
intent here is for safety, not revenue collection (unlike with cars).

	Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
R12.  You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society
(MACS), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per
retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those
R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky
technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).

	Does this piss you off?  Yes?  Write a letter to your congressman, to
your senator, to the president, to the EPA, and to the DOT and complain.

True 914 enthusiasts will be able to give you a better answer then this
but I'll dump my impressions.  I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years
now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake
of my life!)

Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set
in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit.
The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the
engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together
here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger;
a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.

Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you
can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.

The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild
washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good
bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.  Since it is mid-engine you may spend
more on labor for any mechanical work.

Yep, that's when I noticed it too. I stopped replacing the hood badge

2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. Try  
flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you  
get. They usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting  
them to a cop.

	My neighbor runs a Viper(R) distributorship and installs them on all
Saturns sold in my area (Anne Arundel County, MD).  He has an SC with the
Viper voice alarm installed.  The alarm does everything, turn on the car, 
the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors...  The alarm goes
off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by.  It gets sensitive up
to about 5 feet in 85degree heat.  It isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms,
because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says ""Protected by Viper, please
stand back!""  And shuts up...  (mainly because the person walks away

Awww, right, you want all the home mechanics lined up against a wall and
shot eh?

Bull Pucky you chicken! Read the service manual and get your head out of the
sand! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment
rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not
more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work.
You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and
some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering
anyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well,
you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able
to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is
so poor that they would screw up this badly!)

I bet you are one of those people that feels that honing a cylinder wall
with sand paper will kill millions of people. It aint magic. Go take the
certification course, and look at the people that have never learned to add
in their whole life that are taking the certification!

BTW, I am disgusted at the Colt (and some of the other Chrysler offerings)
because they go out of alignment if you sneaze at them. My '84 Chrysler
Laser (Similar to the Daytona, a reskinned Colt) needed a realignment every
3 months ... Bolt a good grade 12' 2x4 to each wheel, using a carefully welded
spacer jig. Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more
difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the
space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on
upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain).
This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up
*right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that
the original poster might not ...

 I don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
 Unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
 fluid.  Follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  Some of the
 cars I have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
 changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
 conditions.  I've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and

Carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is
considered carrying a concealed weapon in Colorado and is illegal without
a concealed weapons permit.  Unless the law has been changed recently,
carrying a weapon openly is legal in Colorado but concealing it is illegal.
I read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the
seat.  The driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
because it was not concealed.  The article stated that if the gun had
been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime.

The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked
quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as
some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we
both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and
performance were both significant.

Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.

Mazda 626
 + very comfortable and roomy
 + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is
   hard to find
 + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
   tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
 - more expensive than many other cars listed below

Honda Civic
 + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
 + comfortable front seat
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)

Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla
 - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
 + adjustable seat belt mounting
 + can get ABS without lots of other extras

Saturn
 + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so
 - motorized attack belts

Dodge Spirit
   no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
 - rear seat does not fold down

Chevy Corsica
 + comes with ABS standard
 - lower ""would you buy that car again"" and safety ratings in
   Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)
 - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
   for some)

The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the
626, and in our minds, not significantly better.

We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the ""big 3"",
due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products,
(b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate
of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the
seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
and no air bag.

We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and
cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14,
I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will
probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind
is whether or not I will have to do a ""factory order"" or ""preference
order"" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will
run the price up a lot if I do so.

That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a small
sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so
the salespeople wouldn't give her the ""bimbo"" treatment.
Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan
Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what ""we""
wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid
kept playing the ""let me run this price by the sales manager"".  After
playing the ""good salesman, bad salesman"" game, we finally told him
that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps
we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in
the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick
in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's ""Don't Get Taken Every Time"" for a
list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of ""you'll have to
work with us on this price"", also known as ""each time you come up a
thousand dollars we'll come down ten"", the salesmanager gave a signal to
his two sales cronies, stood up, and said ""well, we can't come down any
more so I guess we can't help you"" and they trouped out of the room,
leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.
I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they
can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and
I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering
why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the
door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on
the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,
and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few
sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line
(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call
another dealership from ""his"" phone!  I said that since he'd announced
that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried
to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our
voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,
anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.
Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he
begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,
we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.

Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out
the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,

So my friend bought a Sentra.

Just so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the
sales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his
refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the

a young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of
us, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.

Actually, that'd be 155 mph and 60 mph (the legal speed limit for trucks) 
in *two* lanes, each direction. It's a hell of a rush when those trucks fly

The whire wheels aren't chromed, they were to be painted silver/grey.

The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be ""doggy"" because of the light
weight of the car.

Don't pull the topto make it reach the snaps, I pulled a couple out of
the top doing that.  Replacing the spanps usually doesn't work.  Let it
sit in th e sun, open on the car for a couple hours, the try,  GENTLY!!!!

I continually blew up the #4 connecting rod bearing, be sure your not
buring too much oil.

Don't expect too much of a smooth ride.  The lever arm shocks hold the
road, and your bladder.  The are ultra-expensive.  Supposedly the can be
rebuilt.  J. C. Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard
shocks.

I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder, in addition to
the clutch slave.  This work made a world of changes.

Be sure the carb is the original type replacement.  My 1970 had dual
Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs.

Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced.  To replace the engine and
tranny have to be pulled as a unit.

Make sure that they have all maintenance records.  Oil should be changed

Be sure that these have the 16 valve engine.  The 8 valve 318 is a

I think VW got caught out on the airbag thing.  It's only been in the last
year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.
VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for
passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would
actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.

VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the
article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and
Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have
the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US
launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk
of the useful life of the design is spent.

I think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same
quality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine.
Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a
different question...

I'll leave the Passat / Camry flamewar for someone else.

We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the

1. With 4WD, do we need the ""performance axle"" - (limited slip axle).
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain. 

2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the
all-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?

Well, an LT1 Blazer wouldn't come close to a GMC Typhoon in speed, I think its
too heavy.  As it is right now, the normal 210HP 5.7 engine has plenty of 
power for a full size Blazer.  Of course, I'm not saying GM shouldn't put the
LT1 in it :).  It seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  Why
spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve DOHC V8 when you can take 
an LT1?  It even seems to get pretty good gas MPG (for a 5.7, that is.)

Yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door Caprice riding on 17"" aluminum rims and
Eagle GS-C tires.  The rest of the car is basically a Caprice LTZ (read: 
plush police package) with 300 horsepower.

I heard that Chevy is resurrecting the Monte Carlo but that's going to get 
their 3.4 DOHC V6 and not the LT1.

Subject: MGB questions
Summary: Need pre-purchase help
Organization: Wheaton College, IL
Distribution: na
Lines: 35

My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially
restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.
Questions:

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
of braking action?

It seemed to be ""doggy"" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect
it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?

The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather
was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
shrunk?

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?

Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?

Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned
an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with
these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be
appreciated.

I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of

Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly

Sorry 'bout that - Mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with ABS and revised
suspension (whatever revised means)). I'm in Australia, so we always seem to 
get the versions without extras which the Europeans and Americans get as 
standard.

My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after
an oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm
using (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets
noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing). 

Its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.

	Actually, this started as a great idea.  Before steering-column
locks became popular, Saab installed a *gearshift* lock -- put the car
in reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse!
	Also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and
demands your keys at gunpoint.  You hand them over, he gets in, and
HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY!  At this, he will run away (or perhaps
shoot you anyway  %-}).  I heard this actually happened somewhere...
	Btw, I hear that the Saab 900's new successor will have the
ignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs.

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note 
spelling), Renault and Volvo. PRV. This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of
junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.

Bricklins were manufactured in the 70s with engines from Ford. They are rather  
odd looking with the encased front bumper. There aren't a lot of them around,  
but Hemmings (Motor News) ususally has ten or so listed. Basically, they are a  
performance Ford with new styling slapped on top.

Hi netters,

My friend is seriously thinking of getting the Subaru SVX. There is
a local dealer here in Seattle selling them for $22600, with
Touring package, that's $7400 off from MSRP. He thinks it's a 
very good deal (and I think so too). Since he knows I have access to
the net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially
in the area of reliability and maintenanability.
Please send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.

My opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:
auto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),
full wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)

Thanks in advacne!

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five

it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The
older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.
My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm
not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive
system. The older Landcruisers have a ""lock-up"" type. Both have their
advantages and disadvantages.

This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector 
cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is
hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on
the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is
pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent
itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to
fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)

Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a 
discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron
(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,
a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper
injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the
$59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to
do it.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented 
about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old 
'93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it.

Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the

No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious 
places where they screwed up.

Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by
your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the ""credit card"" key that 
came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key
doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))

The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up
all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.

Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.
The previous Probes had Japanese horns.

I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The

Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX-6.

The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of 
head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,
so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
give them a place to put their feet.

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)
I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker
for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!

>I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.

I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes
('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which
Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like
this concerning the '93 Probes.

I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot
that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even
gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them!

From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

Hope this helps,

Oil Pressure, Oil Temperature
Coolant Temperature
Manifold Vacuum
Ammeter, Voltmeter

Fuel Pressure [maybe] (Problematic, since you either need an electronic
sensor/gauge pair or you have to mount the damn thing outside the car)

In addition, it'd be nice to have a big red idiot light 'Check Guages'
connected to Oil pressure, Oil Temp, Coolant Temp, Ammeter &
Voltmeter.  With heaps of guages, it's hard to look at them all all

minute or two of 0 oil pressure would be A Very Bad Thing(tm).

- Plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon
""only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner"" surcharge.

- Prepare your car.  Don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  If
you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on TOP of your stuff
just in case of a flat.  In my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
California desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
the tire.

- If you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.

- McDonalds have good, clean bathrooms.

- invest in a $30 CB & magnetic roof antenna.  It may help if you're stranded,
and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.

- Many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
new state, to catch all the speeders who have ""escaped"" the previous state.

- Same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
65mph rural interstate

I have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile. 
Such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos
that I am aware of.  These are commonly called viscous drive CVTs or
fluidic amplifiers. 

>Contrasted to a clutch which merely slips when feathered (result is no TQ mult)

What the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its
torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's
driveline.  Chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 Camaro (ETs and
terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and
auto cars).  Note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can
get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up
for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed
5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6
speed manulas now). 

>Once past lauch however, the converter begins coupling and the TQ multiplication

	Just a quick, simple question really...

	How many wheels are affected by the emergency brake on an '86 Nissan
Maxima. I've heard that all four are affected, but this would seem unusual
to me. I thought the emergency brake on most cars only affected the rear
wheels. Also, how powerful is the emergency brake usually? Enough to lock
wheels at 30mph? Hmmmm... I just have to wonder about some of the things I

I've had a Valentine for about 9 months now and I agree that it is the best det

 falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t
o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.

That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa

bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo
u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i

Reply-To: pv9955@albnyvms.bitnet

I am considering the purchse of a 1987 VW Jetta GLI with 87k miles on it.
I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v.
I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same
name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard
sunroof. 
Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !!
So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the
two models of the Jetta GLI ?
More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are
no badges that said ""16v"" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version.
Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid
reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ?
(Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)

Please EMail any responses.  Thank you.

Personally, i wouldn't use the $1.29 product from KMart. I knew about
this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss 
(their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends
not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).

Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture
from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the 
others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber 
components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well
with water to help remove it from the fuel system.

I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.).
It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without
the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to 
last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).

I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i 
only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.

and took delivery, they sent a letter telling me they goofed and 
miscalculated the license renewal by $300 and that I need to send
in a check to ""avoid further delay"" in the processing of my registration.
The thing is, I had already received the pink slip from the DMV, so
I ignored it.  I received another letter and then the phone calls
started coming.  First from the finance guy and then from the general
manager, both hounding me for the extra money.  They left me alone
once I told them I already had the paperwork and pointed out the clause
in the contract that stated that the final price was just that: FINAL.
Afterall, they wouldn't budge if I had told them I wanted another
$300 off after the deal had been signed, right?  I told them not 
to call again and that I would not do business with them in the future.
They didn't seem to have a problem with that.  This, after all, was a
used Ford at a Toyota dealership.

I had a much better experience buying a new Pathfinder about a month
ago.  It certainly pays to buy a car on the last Sunday of the month.
It was even raining too, so they had done very little business that 
weekend and were really willing to deal.  I kept telling them I would
think about it, and they kept dropping the price.  Got a very good
deal and so far have been very please with the service.

"Subject: After-Market Cruise Controls: Specific Questions
From: MikeW@Canc.byu.edu (M.D. (Mike) Wieda)
Organization: BYU
Nntp-Posting-Host: 128.187.203.40
Lines: 82

Howdy,

I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the
knowledge and expertise available here.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls

The Background:
I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five 
screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my
home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to
drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of
a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do
all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.

My question:
What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I
realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to
be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a
thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of
accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than
trying to drive with a hosed ankle.

I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with
kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not
electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying
to give information as completly as I can).

I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system 
instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy
this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?

It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the 
negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I
understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read
it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but
harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?

It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a
sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I
might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which
would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned 
the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it
were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.

The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal
and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal
from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm
not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what
exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get
it?

I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative
side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and
all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:

	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a
	    device?
	2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?
	3.  Are ""professionally"" installed CCs signifacantly better and
	    worth the cabbage?
	4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just
	    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple 
	    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,
	    the questions above)?

My father and I built a ""Veep"" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in
high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and
cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that
I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more
complicated than my Veep. :-)

I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any
expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share
some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often
(but I check my mail all the time).

Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.

I'm plannig to trade my Sentra SE-R in with a NX2000.  My car has 11,500
miles on it and is a '92 model.  The NX2000 the dealer is selling is a '91
model with 23,000miles on it.  It has a T-Bar Roof, a/c, and an airbag,
which my Sentra does not have.  They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair
deal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not
seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical
engine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's
engine is a little ""tight.""  So, if I buy the NX2000 and ""excercise"" it
well, should that slight power problem go away?  Any advice on this will be
much appreciated.  Thanks.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.

	Having had my car die on me(engine fire, insurance agent said
it was probably totaled), I am in the market for a another vehicle.
I saw a Toronado that was within my expected price range and was
wondering if anybody could relate their experiences with me.

Namely:  1.  Does it have accceptable power(it has a 305 in it)?
	 2.  Does its being front wheel drive make maintenance difficult?
	 3.  One power window and the power seat do not work, are these

Although, others have in the past and will continue to disagree
i think that it is worthwhile to get an alarm.


>What features are important?

I think that it is important to protect your trunk, engine bay, all
doors.  I'd get flashing lights, LED's mounted on the drivers and
passenger door and a relay to disable engine operation. Toss in 
a glass break sensor, and shock sensor. Door lock and unlock,
two remotes and panic feature are also nice to have.

Most important is where you have the installation done!  Some places
may cost a little more, but a poorly installed alarm (no matter how
much it cost) will be a major burden.


>What features are unimportant?

IMO, things like engine starters, voice alarms, window/sunroof open
and close, and most other conveniences.

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the ""continental
kit."" The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside
mounting bracket; a continental kit is a very specific ornament/storage
compartment. (The 1941 Continental has a neat trunk; it looks rather

Ever' once in a while, you still see a reference to the super-
slab system as ""Interstate and Defense Highways.""  But whether
the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is
another matter.  A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks,
maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff I've
driven -- ""Jeep Classic"" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent
suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup)
weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't
swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.

You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at
least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a
compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity
on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high
speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember
what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a
road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and
narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus 
Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of
the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.

But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if
you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a
Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired
vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.  
Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car
and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around
you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.

Naturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or
unlawful driving.

My last car had T-Tops (BIG T-Tops).  My current car is a convertible.
IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top,
sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no
substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating
down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and
jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the
whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.
So go with something with at least a hole above the driver but don't call
it a convertible.

And I do wonder how those targa tops would compare against my roll
bar in a rollover situation.  Of course, I'd rather not test it
in MY car.  I, too, am in my early 40s.

A convertible--accept no substitute.

I doubt his trans uses standard syncros.  There are several mechanisms for
coupling a gear with the transmission output shaft, some of which are fine

The European version is called 200 SX and have a 1.8 liter engine with
turbo and have more power than the US version ( 169 HP ); it goes from
0 to 100 Km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 Km/h ( 140 miles/h ).
I just purchased one ( new ) and I am looking for a repair book. I could
not find one in FRANCE and GERMANY; does anybody knows where to find one ?
Is there one in the UK ?
Probabaly no use to look in the US as the 240 SX have here a different motor.

I have just taken delivery on a new GM car (Firebird) with a 
clearcoat finish.  I assume that it is probably urethane since the 
industry has moved in that direction in paints.
 
In years past, it used to be recommended that owners wait up to 
60 days before you wax a car, for the paint to ""cure.""  The dealer 
shop manager said this also, but I'm not sure that he wasn't just 
basing it on past tradition.  Does anyone know if this is still a 
recommended practice, or is it better to go ahead and wax right 
away (non-abrasive new car wax) with the newer finishes?

DON'T BUY IT!  All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches
later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably
know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady
character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good
but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you
would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more.
Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many
miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but
you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it
could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this
isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $
5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has
legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who
has been taken a couple of times. Good luck.

If it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. My car
eats a set every 15k miles or so. The fact that he is replacing the
muffler too is also ok.

>Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?

The mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is CV joints. Check
the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.

The 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.

Well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
car with highway miles. 
Might check the gas pedal wear too. Ask him how many sets of tires he
has been through. A highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,
a hard driven car 6-10 sets.

Well, the Maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty
you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. Stuff
for Japanese cars can be expensive.

This is kind of interesting.  I always assumed that the 240SX was named
because of the 2.4 liter engine which it uses.  Likewise for the 200SX
which uses a 2.0 liter engine.  Isn't this true?

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

An aquaintence has a 87 Accord.  The driver's side headrest was
accidentally put in backwards and has jammed.  According to the

disassembling the seat.  This is the second time I have heard of this

Your advice would be appreciated!

Well, the 1.6 IS music to my ears. I often turn my stereo off and just run
it towards red line on nice twisty roads. But Toyota engines at idle have
a strange ""bells and whisstles at the bottom of a matal can"" sound. I can't
describe it any better.
Just like all the older Benzes have a very characteristic clattering sound
at idle. Do you know what I'm referring to?

	They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80 - I forget the

Powerwagon.  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus.

Some GT-40s are street legal, some aren't.

>>This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does
>>a GT-40 go for? How many were made?

I found my Shelby-American guide. There were a grand total 126 GT-40s
built:
		GT-40 Coupes		55
		GT-40 Road Cars		31
		GT-40 Mk II		13
		GT-40 Mk IIIs		 7
		GT-40 Roadsters		 5
		Mirages			 3
		GT-40 Mk IVs		12
		   	TOTAL:	       126
		Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs	6-12

Twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
eight Mk II coupes; 4 LHD Mk IIIs; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs. The other 
breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD
breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.

The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million
mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or
thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).

Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that
was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing
team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory
broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.

Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain. Much of
this information comes from ""Hot Rod"" magazine's ""Shelby American
Cobra/Mustang Guide,"" which has more info on the Shelby-American 
Fords than you could _ever_ want to know.

this is off the subject but,

and Q45 = 4.5liter.. (similar, kinda, to BMW and MB nameing deal).

Don't worry about leaks.  Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing.
Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.  Now, you'll notice, after
all the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be.

Thats why 'heli coils' were invented.  Yes, buy a few of these gems, and
rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil.

Hello,
	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda

too drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new
header.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give
me?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are there
any other comparines would make Honda parts.  

	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't
screw up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?
I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
difference.

Oh, that's not so bad. Every time I try to change the oil, I forget to
shut off the engine first. The hot oil comes out and scalds me, blinds
me, then the engine starts to overheat, and while I'm screaming in agony
and trying to crawl out from under the car, I grab the red hot exhaust
pipe and get third degree burns on my hands. My screams intensify as I
finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of
the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super
heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head
explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.

This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic
$25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new
car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.

Primarily milage.  Gas is much more expensive, so people are very
concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This,
along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with
autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a
manual.

(Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the
money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
drive through the slushbox.)

As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably
reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there
aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.

I agree that the Toyota is the best looking I just didn't fit plus it is the
highest cost of all the ones you mentioned. I have good friends who have all
three of the trucks you talked about, the ones with kids all went to the
ford because of the room required to carry a couple of kids and all the junk
you need. The single ones went for the Toyota and the Nissan. Every one has
been happy with what they bought. Although no one is into serious four wheel
off road driving.

& just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
& transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
& i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very
corse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the
gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back
and forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the
clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If 
you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into
the next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral
between gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the
shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  ""speed shifting""
(which is what I have always heard ""clutchless shifting"" called) works
pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the
clutch-especially for the lower gears.

I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the
engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of
syncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions
that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse
and sometimes first).

My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast,
but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be
operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because
you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much
larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family
sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the
*brakes.*

The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power
plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications.
I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a
brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I
personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is
inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of
the car is not up to par.

I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in
mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much
cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these
cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them
drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.

There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought
it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe
the following to be true:

1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.
2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than
   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them
   far more predictable than most US highways.
3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have
   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in
   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not
   much higher than 120km/h.

I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people
have no respect for their own lives.

I know this is the wrong place to post this, but I couldn't find any
relevant newsgroups in my area.

For those of you who are from PA, where is VASCAR (where the cops
measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  I'm
especially interested in the Pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior
experiences, if possible).  For those PA and non-PA, if they use VASCAR
in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. 
What I'm interested in mainly is where I can speed with the least risk
of being caught.  You can always detect radar, but there's no way to
fight VASCAR unless you know where all the white lines are.

Thanks a lot,

It seems that there are more and more ""bands"" available for
police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within
the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  

Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering.  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the
new Super Ka wideband.  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for
the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense
to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my ""new"" detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.

There is a tool available to reset the service indicator on BMWs but the lights
will come back on after 2-3 weeks. The tool is in fact illegal (in Europe 
atleast). It is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
used BMW and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! Other than that, I know 
of no other tool.... anyone else? 

About changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer Audis, they 
only require it after every 12,000 miles (I am talking about an oil change)
Just a query: do you drive your car VERY VERY carefully? Like no sudden 
acceleration etc? If yeah, then the 15,000 M oil change seems quite reasonable.
But if you drive kinda fast... I'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy

(a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean
all the others will come on every 3k too)

Good point. I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph,
nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:

a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several
1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip
I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800
miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I  
would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles.
No problems with winds and curves. 

Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where
we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.

b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see
no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip
back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind
you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better
than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still
get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.

Now now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine. I see enough
bmws and gasoline mercs for sale that have 100-150k miles on them and advertise 
rebuilt engines. If honda was to build an accord for 30k, I'd darn well
expect the sucker to last 300k miles.

Ever got caught behind a early 80's 300SDL at a stop light? It's not
pleasant. The newer MB's are a lot better though. The diesel Volvos
and VWs are probably the smelliest offenders.

As for economy, why should we care? Gas is cheap! I personally wouldn't
buy a diesel car for any reason - what does it buy me?

  I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that 
think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly 
sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing
danger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of ""distractions""
for me.

   Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault,
and I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber.
But the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I
was too stingy to put on my lights.

   The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to 
oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also
working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.

Not only the Sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc V-4 from Ford of Germany.  This particular
motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
ports.  This motor was later stretched into the V-6 commonly seen in the
Capri.

The V-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  But in the
Saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been
designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.

It depends on your priorities.  A lot of people put higher priorities
on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying ""unsafe"" econoboxes
instead of Volvos.  I personally take a middle ground -- the only
thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
I figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.

the transmission in my car contradicts both your assertions..  i get much
stronger acceleration if i let the convertor lockup.. which i can induce
by briefly lifting off,  then quickly (but not too quickly to trigger
a kickdown) applying throttle.  above 3000 rpms, the convertor will never
unlock;  it would kickdown first.

who says there's no skill involved in driving an automatic?  i think
of it as the throttle and shifter combined into a single pedal.  with
my car i can pretty much influence its shifting patterns with my
right foot, while having both hands to steer.

The question again:
Does anyone have any info on the 1994 Eagle Talon / Mitsubishi

I know that the old Talon was based on the Mitsubishi Galant,
and that in Japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo V6 1994 Galant has been

No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction

If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get

The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang
and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the 
suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.
After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided 
independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
a volume car.  

The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of
the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford
is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will
power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably
do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority. 

Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new
Camaro/Firebird, IMO.  

I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will 
achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation
to ""just get them out the door"" for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
great once demand really takes off.

	The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me
of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs
of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result,
which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the
end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go
wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.

	Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more
in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra
on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car
needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.
I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more
in repair costs.

""IF"" I were the vandal, and I really hated someone, maybe someone who knew
something about cars, of course I would look for ANY types of valves I could
undo.  Especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.

As well as putting bad things in the gas...

While I would never vandalize someone's car, IF I were to, it would probably
be the 'time bomb' approach, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks
that way...

You are sure that what you call a 200SX we call a 240?  Just curious..
We also have a nissan predacessor (sp) to the 240 called a 200, which
came in turbo and nonturbo.  But i don't think we've ever had a 240

i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.

This does sound good, but I heard it tends to leave more grit, etc in the

grit has much time to settle.

Any opinions?

Well, this isn't the right group for this, but I have to say that I don't
think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  How
can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  Do you think
our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged
back then, in fact.
I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here 
about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear 
about something like that, period.

I would guess the high price of gas in Europe (compared to the US) has
always favoured 4-cylinder manuals.

small engines with autos are a real bore...

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in
the US?

My guess is that when they tried to couple manuals to the torque-rich
V8's in the sixties the clutches turned out as real killers you had to 
use both feet to depress, and that this has just lived on.

And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Get an appraiser to look at the car. He will check serial numbers and look 
for origional equipe.  Depending on what mods have been done the car could 
be worth only 10K.  Problems like wrong engine / trans.  Wrong paint type (
vetts used lacquer)  An modification would reduce tthe value.  But your 
looking for a car to drive right?

This sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
/ no air car.  A 427 would put it closer to $30K.

Get it appraised!!!  For insurance purposes also.

A couple of months ago I went to a dealership to test drive a car.  Afterwards,
we sat down to discuss prices.  I explained that I wanted a car just like the
one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like
I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and
signed the deal.

Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected
to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred
over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would
have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the
price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for 
6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good
example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too
bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would
no longer be in business.  

The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the
salesman said was, ""Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out
how much profit I should make.""  The deal went through with no problems.

Two shots at it: (1) Check the tires again - if you can see the wear bars,
you're down to problem area (and some tires pass a penny test between the
bars - that's no guide at all). Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning.
You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the
tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.

(2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put
them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as
soft ones. Effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very
often, such as in competition, but it hits all tires.

The car I bought has good tires.

Is there anything in particular that I should do to
store the defunct car long-term?  I'd hate to have
parts of it go bad.  Someone has told me it's bad
for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.

     I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male
drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Here's a summary of
the replies I received.
 
 
 
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I'm not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).
 
1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model).
No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1,
airbag, abs, security alarm, single.
 
$1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100
for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base
policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.
 
After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.
 
I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had
and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.
 
Hope this helps.

    Kevin:
 
    (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...
 
    You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year
    I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the
    same inquiry as you.
 
    Age: 24 (then and now)
    Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD
    Driving Record: Clean
    State: Illinois
    Cost: $820/6 mos.
 
    I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.
    Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.
 
    I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more

I'm 23; live in Norman, Oklahoma; drive an '89 Thunderbird SC; have
never made a claim against my insurance (though I have been hit
several times by negligent drivers who couldn't see stop signs or
were fiddling with their radios); and I have had three moving violations
in the last 18 months (one for going 85 in a 55; one for ""failure to
clear an intersection"" (I still say the damn light was yellow); and
one for going 35 in a 25 (which didn't go on my record)). My rates
from State Farm (with a passive restraint deduction) on liability,
$500 deductible comprehensive, and $500 deductible collision are
roughly $1300/year. (I was paying just over $1100/year for a '92 Escort LX.)

I am beyond the ""under 25"" age group, but I have an experience a few
years ago that might be interesting to you.  I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica
GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners
included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).
I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling
(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less
money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury
car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.
I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i
decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked
about what would happen to my rate with either car.
 
""If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as
the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that
year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because
the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue
to handle your account.
 
""If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard
[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with
a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,
but cancel you after that.""
 
""But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually
faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.""
 
 That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For
some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -
as very traditional and conservative.""
 
I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche
dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure
guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken
a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I
concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto
theft.

I live in Idaho.  When I was <26 many years ago (10 years) I bought a Trans
Am (new).  Insurance was about $1300/year.  When I turned 26, it immediately
dropped to $460/year.  I had not had any accidents before or after, this was
strictly an age change.  That same rate stayed pretty much the same until I
sold the car 2 years ago.  My F-150 pickup is about $80/year less.
 
The real amazing thing is that when I woke up at age 25, I felt SO MUCH MORE
RESPONSIBLE than I was before...  :-)

	One thing that makes a HUGE difference in MASS is the town you live in.
I'm personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance
of Boston.  If I moved to the absolute best it would go down to about
$1150, if I moved to the worst it would be $2000+..

Unless you are under 20 or have been driving for less than 5
years, I think you are being seriously ripped off.  I don't have
one of the performance cars you listed, but if your record is
clean, then you should not be paying over $2K.
 
Did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find?
Although rates are supposed to be standardized, I've found that
most places I initially call, give me some ridiculously high
quote and *finaly*, I hit one that is much lower.
 
Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at
renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low
rate.  You always have to be careful when it comes to insurance
companies 8^).
 
Good luck,

He made no allegations, and specifically gave the seller the benefit of the

stolen, so watch out and ask questions when buying.  That's good advice to
follow when buying _anything_ from a third party, on the net or elsewhere.

One of the reasons I sold my '92 Civic VX was the chattery-grabby clutch
although I din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
its always humid around here.  I was told by Honda that it has to do with
changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
Someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
legal to manufacture them these days.  My feeling is that since many other
car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
problem on the part of Honda.  Three things to look out for on all Honda
products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.

Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of
those car hunters?  I'm selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted
by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.  

They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't
be talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything
about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if
they didn't sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since
I charged it, I'm protected by federal law which states that if I'm not satisfied,
I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork 
to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.

I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
good news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been
over week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of 
companies? Anybody care to share their experiences?

Here in Houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand.  She
found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle.  She quite
reasonably asked him to stop.  He refused, began taunting her, and
as the woman was quoted in the police report, ""He told me to go
ahead and shoot him, so I did.""  The moron survived, and no
charges were filed against the woman.

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its
directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later
called a ""gimmick"" -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the
detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's
significantly more expensive.  While the added capabilities may not
help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
there are a lot of false-alarms.

>Summary: Valentine-1 way too expensive and not a significantly better
>performer!

I certainly call it ""interesting"" but I'm another person who thinks
that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very
adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
one of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance
travelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider
getting the V-1 because it's additional information would be useful in
discriminating false alarms.

all of my HO's disagree with your HO's.  I LOVED Dallas rush hour in my stick..
detested it in the auto(like i did any other time in the auto...).  Of course,
Dalls rush hours are nothing, from what i hear..if i lived in LA, i might
be of a different persuasion.  And, just for the record, rarely do you shift
gears when merging into traffic..that is what 5 speeds are good for..4th is
good up through around 80-90, most of the time, so you can just wind it out..
it's not going to hurt anything, and keeps it in the powerband anyway..
only shift into top gear when you are exceeding redline in 4th(fairly rare,
unless you drive a ferrari or some such, i'd bet) or when you hit cruising 
speed where you feel comfortable(or when my mother is sitting in the 
passanger seat complaining about how you wind her ""poor little engine"" way
too hi :-)

Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through
Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it
was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.

Actually, I've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage

Anyways, don't tear up the quotes just yet...I sometimes use their

I can vouch for this method in my 1990 SHO.  This is the only sure way of 
putting in the reverse without any problem _every_ time.

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  Last month my brother bought 
a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  They came back with the 
final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  There happened to 
be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error 
and asked them to re-think their addition.  They came back with the right 
price the next time.

Being a satisfied Audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th Audi) I
get the free VAG magazine. The latest issue presented a new S4 Avant
(wagon) with a 4.2 litre V8. I'd like one of these ;-)

Btw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and I must say that
even in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in
road holding and balance that I hope I can afford them always.

Junk?  They've made the C&D lists for years due to their excellent handling and  
acceleration.  They have been around since about, oh, 85 or 86, so they're not  
the newest on the lot, and mileage is about five to eight MPG under the class  
leader.  You can get into a 3.0 L v-6 (141 hp) Shadow for $10~11K (the I-4  
turbo a bit more), and a droptop for $14~15K.

       I just had my rotors on my '92 Taurus GL changed less than 500 miles
   ago and...you guessed it, I'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor.
   :-(  I had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
   high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem.  This is a brand new
   rotor bought from a Ford Dealership.  Can't they even produce a brand new
   rotor that is not warped?  I'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
   out for a new rotor.

       This is my first American build car and I'm not overly impressed.

--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models
  is the ""300"", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the
  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0
  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared
  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new
  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look
  completely different.

According to _The Complete Guide To Specialty Cars_, 7th Edition, from

An excerpt from the blurb:

   ...This fine Kubel clone from Wolfkam is a very close copy of
   the original, and offers the same all-weather and cross-country
   capabilities as its WWII forebears.  The robust fiberglass body
   kit is very complete, and includes all the hardware you will

P.P.S., I'm looking for a used or partially completed Porsche 356

I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.

just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems
to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need
to calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little
more.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you
the car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should
let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about,
about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled
by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem,
though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault
for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been.
Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my
liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by
cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the
fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with
them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline
will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything
over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe
they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all
testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves
before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have
_heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and
the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under
which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way,
_not_ an arrest warrant.  In short, perhaps because the BATF is wildly
out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a
compound full of woman and children will not improve their position.
There is a real chance that Koresh will be able to prove self-defense
in court.  That will leave - what? - four officers dead and no one to
blame but the BATF.

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these ""real""

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too
shallow to use!

I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when
she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from
would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who
as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).

Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes
you rear look wide as a cows!

 Also, to have the habits that
work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater
what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)

A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside,
none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6
pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!

As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you,
women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!

When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and
my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent
than the pants pockets and looks better.

Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is
paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem.
A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e.
Image some red necks yelling at you ""We are going to FUCK YOU!""
and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight
on you!)

If you want to find out why a women does something, LIVE AS ONE!

Oh come on, Silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and 
put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.  What do you
think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?
They're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide
access to the oil-fill hole.

Well, over where we live, we have problems with vandals stealing 
people's wheels.  Those locking nuts didn't stop them.  So to be
safe and sure, I welded the lug nuts to my wheels together.  It
works, serious!  I haven't had my wheels stolen yet!

What do you mean by ""all models"", all models of cars, all Chrysler models,
all models that the fleet manager had bought? Because there is no way in

Save youself the cash.  Take it from a BMW mechanic.  Idiot lights are for just that.  Buy yourself a ballpoint pen and write it down yourself.  Change your oil every 3000 mi. and you will be just fine.

I just visited the NY Auto Show, and saw two LH cars on the floor: Eagle 
Vision and Dodge Intrepid. 

Really nice I must say. Very attractive styling, lots of features and room, 
at a competitive price.  

Unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars,
the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out
the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing
the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come
off easily.

I am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly
problems that will show up later.

I may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good
track record.

The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front.  They
still
run a straight axle, but with coils.  The 4Runner is the one with
independent
front.  The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system.

The 91-up Cruiser does have full time 4WD, but the center diff locks in
low range.  My brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all the 4+ trails in Moab without a tow.  The 93 and later is even
better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.

I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.
In consumer reports it is ranked high in many
catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.
Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).

A couple of things though:
1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this
   car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.
2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully
   loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match
   up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993
   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.

I guess my question is: Is this a good deal? 
Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?

Thanks,

Carl Hoffman

P.S.

The other cars that I have test driven and which are in the
running are:
Mitsubishi Galant, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camary

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.
 
 And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.

Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they
get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list.
Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.
And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on

Just great. Well built, handles beautifully, plenty of power. I've only
had if 'off tar' once. Did a trip over the mountains on a narrow, windy

I havent had so much fun driving a car for years!

In Des Moines, Iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an 
overpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  It put a dent in the roof, 
so I guess I was lucky it hit metal.

It's frustrating that we can't do much.  Bother the city government to put
covers on all overpasses?  Slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all
overpasses in the city?  I like the first better, but that will take time
and lots of people talking to the city governments.

Just another .02...

Oh, well... I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of
Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like
""Do you dare to risk your family in any car?"" attitude, which is quite
annoying in the long run.

But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive,
2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine
""CAR"" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And
the American magazine ""Road & Track"" said that ""This is not your uncle
Olof's car"", and in a positive sense.

But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like
chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)

BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar
drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)

What? You mean what I drive? A cheapo Japanese (a Toyota) of course,
I do not have money for a *car*. (like BMW, Merc, Jaguar, Saab 9000, 
Volvo 850 (or 960), etc)
If I had the money, I would have *bad* problems deciding which one
to buy :-) :-) :-).

I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national 
defense plan etc.  The  requirements were to move heavy army trucks at 
70mph.

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph 
on the same 3 to 4 lane road.  Around Washington DC they can't keep traffic

On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the ""electronic""
odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven
by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are 
converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.
No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to
change as any other mechanical odometer.

On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple
switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter,
which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)

I have been for a fairly hard run in an MX5, what they lack in power they
surely make up for in handling.  Great for back streets with heaps of corners.
They are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
revving DOHC engine, a fun car.  Have you driven a TURBO converted
MX5?  Now they are starting to perform!  I've often thought a Mazda rotary
would go well in the XM5 too....anyone done it?

Having driven both, and having owned an SC300 for 14 months now, all I can
say is ""it depends"".  They're both great cars.  In fact, my wife and I
are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300ZX convertible in a year.
The 300ZX handles like a dream, while the SC300 rides like a dream.
Fit and finish on both are excellent, but the Lexus gets the nod in
customer satisfaction.  They're both very attractive, and hideously
expensive.  The resale value of the SC is better than the ZX.  The
300ZX isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful
on slippery surfaces.

Difficult on front. Easy on rear. They are not expensive. about $75-$100
for front and less than $50 for the rear.

Its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
proper equipment.

actually, disabled persons have been known to drive in SCCA

Before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm,
let's go on the assumption that one is desired.  The question then remains,
which one?  I've owned a Hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get
another for my new car.  The Alpine has been highly recommended, but what about
Clifford and VSE's Derringer 2?  Any others?  I want all of the standard stuff;
door lock interface, starter kill, light flash, LED, valet mode, passive/active,

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't
'pass it on' (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or more
lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who
are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C.
area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until
the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos
won't make room.

We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin
John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up
yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point
where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic
which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other
side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up
the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-
stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be
real useful here.

Bob

PS: If you drive the beltway and want to merge, look for a brown Probe
with a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I don't read minds,
but I do try to be courteous. They told me courtesy was contagious, but
I guess the folks around here have had their shots :-/

Could be due to the rear-end ratio also.  

Usually automatics have different rear-ends than manuals, from

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it 
yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase
just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.

>i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825.

I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for
retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can 
get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage
and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself.
Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country
that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for
California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is
to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or
looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It 
might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for
6 months for the best price).

>an acquaintence
>has offered to give me blue book value for the car.

I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure
that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's
a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating
than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying
in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go
elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot
or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.  That's probably a safer approach
than selling to a private party.

I agree.  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me

GM, at least, is heading in that direction.  One of the post-sale
questions they asked me was if I'd like the choice of a cigarette
liter or an accessory plug, and another whether I'd like the choice of
an ashtray or a cup holder.

The '93 Geo Storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
(which did not exist in the '92 I bought) -- I'm not sure about the
ash tray vs cup holder.  It's a step in the right direction.

The ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not
completely useless.

the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles

which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat
six in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that
their engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out
that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to
nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than
this.

By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had
its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up
steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,
and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good
books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the
Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil
Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the
right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I
don't know why.

A ""fuel injector cleaning"" at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,
and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for $1.29.
 
Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.

Talk to Philip Greenspun. He took Ford to court recently and, despite much
manouvering and trickery on Ford's part, he won! Well, actually I think
Ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped

Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the
oil when the engine is cool, i.e. not when you are at a gas station.

Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also
browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun,
and 4WD magazines.  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently
graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips
to be a bedload.  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be 
used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad
approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your
information sources accordingly.

Of the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner, 
Pathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based 
on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably 
carlike.  Don't know much about the Pathfinder.

Good luck,

   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New

under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

NNTP-Posting-Host: phakt.usc.edu

Hi,
I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.
Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound.
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say 
this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?
And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse:
   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.
   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is
      fully depressed.
   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.
   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if
      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)
   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.
   6- The shifter acted normally after that.

When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the 
clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last
week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the
problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car.  
In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,
and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily
solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck. 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting 
from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi.  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to
bore you with the long post.

Thanks,
Rabih.

Ehhhh, maybe. The '93 Mustang Cobra does a good job for a lower price,
and it's just a taste of what's ahead in the 30th Anniversary of

I don't know about trains, but I've saw a sign on the back of a

It doesn't explain why, but it does set off my radar detector.

Your best bet is the Dodge Intrepid with the SOHC 24 valve 3.4? six.
it gets 214 hp, and has a hell of a lot of room, great styling, and
ABS, with four wheel disk breaks.  The LH cars won Automobile

The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed
per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually.  

This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT -- it took SOOOOOO
LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio.

The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an
electronically-shifted manual.  Might this mean that Saturn has
conquered the problem?  (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds)

INPUT, PLEASE!

Another question:  Any plans for a manual-trans Chrysler LH?
Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?

My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  
The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but 
lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but 
the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you.  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously.

I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for 
a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance.

Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton
HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 
this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission, 
heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They 
could not install a non-defective transmission in at 
least four attempts.

So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but 
you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you 
paid too much in the first place, or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.

You are not alone.  My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  
showing the same behavior.

I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  
about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  
rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  
have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.

The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  
engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  
part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  
rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   
Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  
the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.

This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  
manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  
cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.

Not to my knowledge; I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates (i.e. the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East) but 
things like that are always done by third parties, NOT the manufacturer.
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
perhaps the police cruiser package on the Caprice/Crown Vic and start from
there.

""And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out

for bulletproof cars. 

Check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. They'd

PR11 (power everything), and AR007 (Armor).

I have tested both vehicles (identically

Curiously (and consider these are test
vehicles), I found the Mercury higher
in build quality than the Nissan.

Either choice is good, but beware that
I did not experience reasonable mileage
with the V6.  Average city driving was
<15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.

Both were optioned to the hilt (the Nissan
had leather!).  The Villager was in the

As unfair as it may seem, the difference between Chrysler and Toyota is
that Chrysler needs to prove that it can build quality cars. Toyota can
afford make a few small mistakes without hurting the image.

After all, door seal failing on a 6-year old Stanza is not comparable to 
the same problem on a brand new Intreprid.

Now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but
I just ordered my first car with an auto trans. I wasn't planning on it; but
after driving a few I was convinced: Things have changed since the days of 
""Slip 'n' Slide Withe Powerglide"". They shift *better* than I do, there's no
clutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done
for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it
easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)

(Oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the 
Motor City- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on 
manual. Shift envy?)

Braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing 
out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. Call me a convert.

Japan is _much_ more open than Korea.

Yes.  A Pontiac Grand Am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price
when it is exported to Japan.

However, a Dodge vehicle (the one that Congressman Gephardt mentioned)
suffers a factor of _4_ increase in price when it is exported to Korea.
A Ford Taurus suffers the same problem.  A Honda Accord costs--I am
not making this up--$48,000 in Korea.

Just how many people would want to buy a Honda Accord for $48,000?

Solution:  All ships carrying Korean-made vehicles should be returned
           to Seoul.  Pronto.  Until as such time as Korea decides
           that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade
           with the USA and Japan.

I am sorry to report that in Southern California it was a sick sport
for a while to drop concrete blocks from the overpasses onto the
freeway.  Several persons were killed when said blocks came through
their windshields.  Many overpass bridges are now fenced, and they
have made it illegal to loiter on such bridges (as if that would stop
such people).  Yet many bridges are NOT fenced.  I always look up at a
bridge while I still have time to take evasive action even though this
*sport* has not reached us here in Fresno.

	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;


Toyota 4runner:

Nissan Pathfinder:
	
	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has

Isuzu Trooper:

	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,

	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10""
	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to

Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and

	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?

i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
that says so.

the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.

i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
recent hondas can approach.

The clutch on my '92 Honda Civic EX-V (EX in the U.S.) does this too.
It's annoying.  Now that I think about, it _is_ worse when the humidity is
high.  The dealer also claims there's nothing they can do since the clutch is 
a ""self-adjusting hydraulic design"".  Yeah, right.

The 91 and 92 Cruisers run the 4.0L straight 6 which only has about 150hp 
and 220lb-ft of torque.  Plenty off-highway, marginal on the highway.
The 93 has a much improved 4.2L straight 6 with >200hp and 275ft-lb torque.

If you take them on rough trails, you'll see the difference.  The Cruiser
is an order of magnitude better in off-highway ability.

That's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.  
The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume  
at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. It might be a funny munber but  
it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays  
sticker price is really being ripped off.

 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling
the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid
claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans.  Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?

I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon.  Third gear would
just disengage.  Engine would rev up.  Kind of disconcerting.

I sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny
sticks with me.  It also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer
could not fix.  If the lemon law had been in place then, that car
would have been covered.

I have had several Jap cars since then (figuring the Horizon was my
contribution to the American Auto Companies), and have never seen any
bad behavior with the exception of a Toyota Tercel with a bit of
clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.

Anyway, from that day forward, I have sworn that I would never
purchase another American car with a standard.  American manufacturers
don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and
have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars.
However, I hate automatics, so I am still buying Jap cars.

Not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.

>2door, so they will pay the extra 1.2k???

Ok, here's what I understand:

The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:

Honda Civic
Toyota Tercel (SL,SL1)
Toyota Corolla (SL1,SL2)
Nissan Sentra
Mazda 323/Protoge'
Subaru Loyale/Impreza
Isuzu Stylus
Geo Prizm
Ford Escort
Mercury Tracer
Mistubishi Mirage
Plymouth/Dodge Colt


Their core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other
models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.
I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese
technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small
cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I
think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese
roots.

The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:

Toyota Paseo
Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si
Nissan NX1600/NX2000
Mazda MX-3
Isuzu Impulse
Geo Storm
Ford Escort GT


If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're
4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and
trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan
platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher
prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:

Tercel -> Paseo
Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000
Civic -> del Sol
323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one)
Stylus -> Impulse/Storm

To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at
around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now,
you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors
offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable
powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the
Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a
1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.
Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more
fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more
money for this type of car.  


In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence ""less"" car, it's market
orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
sedan (SL1/SL2) version.

I hope this clears things up a bit......

In the past few years I have owned 3 Mustang GTs and now own a 91 T-Bird SC. 
They all have had this problem. There was a recall on the T-bird for the brake 
problem. The Ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
after about 10K miles. Between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
the T-Bird I'll never buy a Ford again.

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a
case of violence by teenagers...

For a little perspective:

How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local
agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?

Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring
breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of
volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess
after the Rodney King riots in LA?

Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the
school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer
to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have
tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How
many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for
good causes?

The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at
school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real
contribution to our society?

All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa
was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.

It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational
reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today!
It is a reflection of what is happening on the outer fringes of our
society and nothing more...

I am considering buying an new car, so I called three insurance
companies in California to get estimates. I asked for the same
coverage and same deductibles. Most of the companies charge you
according to your zip code. Others charge according to your city.
Anyhow, I gave the same zip code and city to all three places. Here's
what I found (for a '93 Integra GS):

AAA: ~$2000/yr.
State Farm: 2614.92/yr.
Allstate: 1220/yr.

AAA is non-profit, so they said I could also expect to receive about
$200-300 back at the end of the year.

Still, There is a huge gap between all of these companies. State Farm
wants MORE than TWICE as much as Allstate. I think I should be
suspicious, but I've never heard anybody else complain.

Any comments?

Greetings automobile enthusiasts.  Can anyone tell me if there is
a mail order company that sells BMW parts discounted... cheaper than
the dealerships.

Sorry if it's a FAQ. email replies very much appreciated.

Thanks,

I had the exactly same problem with my '70 Lesabre. It was also from Cal.     What I did was go to the local junkyard and pick up a diaphragm from a '68      Lesabre with the same heater set up.  It worked for me, but a little bit slow   to change from vents to defogger.  Better than nothing!

Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys
are _really_ paranoid!

You're actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil?

C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!

That's absolutely ridiculous!

Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil?

I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and
changed the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but
once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it
gets easier.

I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.

New Integra supposedly wedge shaped again.  175 hp and all-wheel drive
in top models.  Then a variant called the zx-r comes later. (roadster?).

i think it gets unveiled at end of summer.

    We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I
 think we really need all the info on this we can get).

    I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade
 details.  

   Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of
 certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding
 usefullness?

    I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure
 we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is
 that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what
 you should do instead.

     I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol
 which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of
 the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the
 Ozone Depletion Problem.)

     Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast
 to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other
 greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by
 infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem
 (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same
 thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's
 (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which
 are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.
 Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help
 the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.

Well, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.
I take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment.
My job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus
some in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.

Yes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535) 
most US freeways are just fine. The problem is other road users and

Wouldn't you rather have some type of standard ""electrical"" plug instead of

anyone else experiencing a similar problem?

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch
is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there
is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the
clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San 
Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated
that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to
non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!! Seems that moisture on clutch

If your Viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get
any sleep because of the damn thing waking every one in the neighborhood
up.

We all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
or a stray dog looked at the car.

Car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to
""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets
the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport""
mode entail?  several things:

1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)

2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the
	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching)

3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is
	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.

also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a
5 speed)?  

how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will
be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high
revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.

Sorry I can't help you with your question, but I do have a comment to
make concerning aftermarket A/C units.  I have a Frost-King or Frost-Temp
(forget which) aftermarket unit on my Cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
it.  The fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  I will never have
an aftermarket A/C installed in any of my vehicles again.  I just can't
trust the quality and performance after this experience.

We used to have a tax in Greece named after the Queen's Mother. The Queen

I am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. 
I take VERY serious offence in your statement. 
I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been
releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?
Where did you learn logic?

As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS
seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets
and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.

Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above.
It hurts.

This really bugs me.  The emissions of diesels are the cleanest of any vechicle,
but they are considered so polluting that they are banned in passenger cars
in California.  What a bunch of crap.  Diesel is the fuel of choice for 
enviromental benefit in Europe while here it's illegal for the same reason.

The particulates are nothing but carbon.  They are just an annoyance at worst.
Nothing beats the diesel cycle for efficiency and emissions, torque or engine
durability.  It's also cheaper.

[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly
asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions
of general consumer interest, and is broken out to facilitate
crossposting to misc.consumers -- rpw]

[last change: 8 February 1993; CT now permits radar detector usage,
    new tire-traction q&a -- rpw]

                Commonly Asked Questions

Radar Questions:

Q:  Where are radar detectors illegal?

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit
    all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in
    large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,
    Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They
    are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.
    Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other
    jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.

Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?

A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,
    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe
    to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.
    They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently
    available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate
    more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.
    New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected
    by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a
    detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned
    on.

Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?

A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance
    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target
    vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR
    system.

Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be
    able to handle it? 

A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US
    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a
    low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the
    direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the
    radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.
    Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low
    power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar
    detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,
    although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such
    capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use
    is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:
    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they
    are used (or else, don't speed.)

Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?

A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.
    Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.
    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the
    military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the
    Federal Communications Commission of the USA.

Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:

Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?

A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a
    car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)
    Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to
    be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they
    tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',
    or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)
    Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that
    untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into
    trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle
    in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance
    oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing
    throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle
    may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or
    spinning.

    Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car
    will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the
    angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling
    and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to
    travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle
    than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater
    slip angle than the front wheels.

Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?

A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear
   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally
   you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop
   rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle
   before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to
   the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.

Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?

A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while
   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot
   for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you
   use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to
   match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;
   often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side
   on the throttle.

   Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the
   left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing
   the same thing.

Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?

A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of
   three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for
   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the
   transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with
   rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch
   engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission
   speed up.

   The procedure is as follows:
   (0) declutch
   (1) move gearshift lever to neutral
   (2) engage clutch
   (3) match revs
   (4) declutch
   (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear
   (6) engage clutch

   This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.
   The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the
   synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or
   with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.
   Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at
   all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good
   condition.

Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and
   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?

A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and
   2) almost never.

   In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times
   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the
   same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine
   that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite
   pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from
   driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*
   major) part of the equation.

   Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really
   only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically
   when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the
   comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.
   This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads
   are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply
   of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.

   Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the
   automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced
   by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the
   car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making
   a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end
   of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car
   has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'
   setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of
   caveats could go on for page after page.

Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according
   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate
   or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?

A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.

   2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics
   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,
   none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a
   stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating
   temperature.

   Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser
   extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a
   substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been
   coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match
   the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire
   at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses
   inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling
   friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire
   is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will
   be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its
   proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some
   part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like
   to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.
   (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal
   street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of
   high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)

   Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,
   it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters
   accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than
   1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible
   for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of
   grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques
   such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.

Misc. Questions:

Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?

A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked
    about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names
    as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER
    ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.

    Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,
              or The Swedish Airplane Corporation

    Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,
              or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company

    Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,
              or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin

    BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,
              or Bavarian Motor Works

    MG:     Morris Garage


Q:  Does VW own Porsche?

A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and
    Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,
    which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some
    financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may
    be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this
    is only speculation at this time.

I agree with Jeff's reply.  I've never changed the brake fluid except when
having a brake job, which is usually at around 80,000 miles (alot of
freeway driving).  However, I will start to do this as preventative
maintenance on my new car.  Also, there are brake system flushing agents
that can be used but the problem is that if any of the agent is left in the
system, it can cause problems, so it's been recommended NOT to use them unless
you are 100% certain that you can remove all of the flushing agent.  Just for
your info, I was quoted a price of: labor=$29.95 and fluid=$9.95 for
flushing the brake system; this in conjunction with a break job so I don't
know if it was more without the brake job. This is in the S.F Bay Area.

Let me add my .02 in. I had a A/C installed by the Ford garage and it did not
work as well as the A/C that was installed by the factory in pickups 
identical to mine. I have talked to other people that have had the same

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason
they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we
actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions
which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
limits have been defined.  

Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates
are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit
signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence
is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.

And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is
awful and it can even burn the eyes.  

Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.

Perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights
are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of
letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse
and that they can also light up the area behind your car while
you're backing up so you can see?

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used
to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright
enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're 
MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s. 

Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93
model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see
red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the
car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors.

G'day people,
	
	Are there any MR2 owners or motor-head gurus out there, that know why
my MR2's engine sounds noisy? The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times, 
but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises. 
	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine
noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month
mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months
now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving,
but more so during idling. 
	What's its problem? 
	Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little
performance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to. 

	Any help/tips would be appreciated!!

Alright, beat this automobile sighting.

Driving along just a hair north of Atlanta, I noticed an old, run down
former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older
rare or exotic foreign sports cars. I saw:

Ford GT-40 (!), the famous model from Ford, that seemed to win most of 
its races in the late 60s, including Le-Mans 4 or 6 times.

Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?

Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)

THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model
that I couldn't identify.

And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.

Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly
sold in the U.S.

And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo
or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini.
The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator 
in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from
the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk
and go to the outside from here.
The taillights looked like they
would be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the
make of this one is?  

Certainly made my day...

re: extended Ka bands.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm
nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this
area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state
as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:

- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
  what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I
  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,
  ""Ka stands for K automatic""... duuhh.  He then went on to say that
  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
  tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.

- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
  even the real sneaky ones.

- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here
  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used
  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.

So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high
performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal
to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that
Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully
relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at
least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.

I'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons, but I would ask you if

  Well, before we start calling the Engineering folks in France a bunch of
braindeads for this... 
  My 1979 Mercury Capri had this lovely feature. This was not the earlier
German variant but the newer one that was identical to the Mustang of 
current fame. I can't tell you how many times this feature pissed me off.
Come to think of it my brothers Zepher had this as well.

Bzzt.
The manta was a two-door sedan in the US.
It had a 1900 engine.
Was sometimes referred to as an Opel 1900.
Manta's are also ve hot and fun cars too.

Geico has purchased radar guns in several states, I know they have done
it here in CT.

I have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by Geico
for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  And once
you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.

My suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but STAY AWAY from Geico!

assuming yours is a non turbo MR2, the gruffness is characteristic of
a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota
didn't care about ""little"" details like that when they can brag about
the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.

myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or
recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
ever want a halfway decent engine.  

if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do
except to sell it and get a V6.

Try another dealer.  Sometimes the sophistication of equipment etc is

Ford tried that also, back in 1983.  My 1983 Ranger Pickup had the horn at
the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
God intended it to be. :-)  I drove two different cars then (the other an
1984 Camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to
blow the horn.  The only time I got it right was when I was getting the
annual state-required safety inspection!
Not one of Ford's better ideas.

Just to clear things up (as to why I posted the question that way)...
I was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  I claimed they were
cleaner-burning than gas engines.  He said the extra ""junk"" put out by them
was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   I made all the SAME claims
you did.  But, one question of his was what about the carbon?  I said it
was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  I suggested
scrubbers.  (I figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
than ""cats"".)  Does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (I'd like
to know just to answer his final question.)  I convinced him that diesels
are cleaner otherwise.

BTW, (I named my subject ""Dirty Diesels"" because I knew it would get a reaction
out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
read it...)

   I sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
 motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but I think they are probably
 measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.

   I certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
 diesel truck and some diesel cars.  They stink!  And it's always
 roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
 of me when I am driving with my family.

   I don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
 control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  So the 
 invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  Yeah,
 well so what!?  Someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
 as far as I am concerned, those kind are just as bad.

    I am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  It'll keep the
 traffic signs cleaner, too.

I'll pick up that PM and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
the actual car, but a prototype?

I saw the Mach III and was not all that impressed -- it looked WAY too
Japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a Nissan NX...

Glad I didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  Maybe they'll work on
the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
'95 or '96.  It always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
e.g. the F-body Camaro/Firebirds (btw, the new Camaros look like shit too).

If your buying a compact pickup do yourself a favor and wait a few months
for the 1994 GMC sonoma.  Magazines are saying it is day and night over the
current truck.  It's georgeous, solid, and fast (200hp Vortec 4.3 V-6).
Should whip the Ranger in every area too (accept maybe payload).  And always
pick a GMC over a Chevy.  GMC's are always so much better looking.  Man, I 
miss the Comanche.

I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have
some comments to share.

The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to get
the safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has 
aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather
weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.

The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a
waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a
waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if
you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book
and said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...

Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the
tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the
library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't
get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering
a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.

So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station 
later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I
could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide
to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do
I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?

Any comments about it will be welcome!

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with
the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:

1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged.
2. All use an ""aftercooler"", which cools the air which was heated
   by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI).
3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air
   intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is
   low.

No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from
the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.

Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output 
and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket
turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power,
and these are approved by the CARB.

While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently  
when I bought a new truck.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we  
agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax
and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.  
When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could  
get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he  
started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had  
miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed  
another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was  
their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then  
brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I  
reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be  
treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole  
deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  
snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  
the turn of events.

Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  
to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  
asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him  
that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,  
that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs  
and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still  
pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to  
lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  
him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.

A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  
apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  
knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  
it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  
and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....

I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  
decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  
back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  
truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  
incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  
there in my new truck in about 30 mins.

So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  
have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  
person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  
sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  
mistake.

Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  
dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  
I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.

I can relate to this. I've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point,

Another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my
personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this
one, too).  

While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out
slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into
position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the
gears grind.... You will just glide back.

Many cars sold here in Finland are *small* and *cheap* cars (at least when

And you couldn't expect a good auto mated to a 1.3 L engine?

Most of the bigger cars are, however, sold with autos.

*nnnnnnnng* Thank you for playing, I cannot agree with this.  I believed
this and to put it nicely, it was a piece of junk!

I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just
couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the
problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the
ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any
chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to
reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe
it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,
just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)
salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,
and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.
Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but
they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of
work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care
of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took
it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.

1988 Dodge Shadow ES

These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.

Engine 
4 Alternators
Rear Suspension Torsion Bar
2 Water pumps
5 thermostats
Hall effect sensor
Main computer
4 Batteries

These were rebuilt/repaired

Radiator
Automatic Transmission
Power Steering


Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For
about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I
just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I
traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I
just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000
worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite
me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are
going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the
hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.

You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but
Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I
feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler
product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I
will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM
isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do
their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  

Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a
hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car
is really good, until it has proved itself to me.

But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because
I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good
thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were
they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend
always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.

And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I
will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink
with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the
shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the
chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just
average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You
can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched
the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal
of information about this company, just because it is a new american
company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for
good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of
any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I
think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in
Toyota said and I quote, ""We are watching them very closely.""  Come on,
everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been
kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make
a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to
set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They
are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the
ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,
but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called
competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the
consumer, well your out..

I'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.  Since I paid
cash for the last car I bought I did not have to worry about
whether or not I had a good amount of insurance on it because
of a bank loan.  I just put the amount that I wanted (not what
a bank would have wanted).  Friends are telling me that banks
require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it
is collateral on loans.  Is this true?  Can that insurance be
gotten as part of my other insurance?  I assume I don't have to
pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.
Am I correct?  I hear about accident/health type insurance at
the dealers and I am pretty sure these are just money makers
for them.  I just want to verify that I don't _have_ to buy
these at all.  Or any other types of extras.

What do I have to pay for?  Car, tax, license.  Anything else?

My 1983 VW has tach, water-temp, voltmeter

in general extended warranties are a ripoff.  this 6yr/60k is really only
3yr/24k because you get the 3yr/36k one *free* with the car.  also, is there
perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty?
also, are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty?
and if you use it at year 4 for some 60 buck job and pay a 50 deduct and then
you have used it so no refund ever!
again, extended warranties are ripoff, high profit items for the dealer.

Try Eagle GAs, wear better, cost less, lose little handling, and are

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in, even if you're
giving it enough gas to normally move it in 1st.  You might need a brake
adjustment.

Watch it closely, the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor, it
seems stronger in the drivers window then the others.

I've found the location (under the armrest in between the seats) to be a
pain, but like having them.  They moved it into the dash (pop out) in the
'91 model year, MUCH better.

I did the same thing.  Got a black '89 with 65.5k miles on it for $8k

Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.

************************************************************

The Event:

* The Joliet Mud Turtles, a Chicago land four wheel drive club, is
  sponsoring an On/Off Road Rally Sunday April 25th.

* For those who ask ""What is an on/off road rally?"", well...

  An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:

   1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
      directions and clues guiding participates around the 
      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course
      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will
      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the
      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately 
      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points
      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.

   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half
      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will
      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified
      4x4s can run the course.
     
  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring
  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.
  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.

* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles
  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be
  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section
  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
  from their vehicle :) .

The Particulars:

* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.
    (815)436-9382   (see map below)
* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.
* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine
* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.
* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)
* A valid drivers license is required
* Suggested equipment:
      CB Radio
      Compass
      Tow Strap and Clevis
      Clip Board and Pencil
* No alcohol during rally

while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/
targa thing as well.  I simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance,
nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do.  If i chose a convertible,
it'd be:

a) Mazda RX7 II.  I just like the way they look.  It'd have to be in black,
with color matched black top(they look good!)

b) VW cabriolet.  They do a suberb job of matching colors too.  Also, last year
for them!  {***COLLECTOR'S ITEM****}

c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too.

i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-)

good luck to your wife.(and you :-)

just out of curiosity, how is this ""dog clutch"" any different from a synchro
transmission.  What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little
i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs""
and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized
gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,
that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?

I just ordered a Saturn SL1 after considering a few imports. Frankly, the Saturn
way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new
car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by
most salespeople I met.

Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where
I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales
support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what
I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the
dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on
what he's seen and heard from his customers. 

Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles, 
fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or
so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more
like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
warranty work, without counting against the refund.

 A 68 Corvette but, I don't want to put Corvette seats in it.  The original
 seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  I'm going to
 store those and find a set to drive in.  I have all the Vette catalogs but
 I'm looking for a more generic type seat.  I can modify the brackets but 
 cushion height and overall width are a concern.  I've looked through some
 local boneyards without success.  I would just like to find a pair of 
 cheapo's to use this summer.

Nobody is using discrete IC's to do these functions anymore if at
all.  I doubt any of the Motor electronics had any to start with.

I can almost guarantee that it'll a fruitless attempt to figure out

i think that automatics have advanced far more than manuals.
especially in shift intelligence.  i say that a smart automatic is
better than the majority of drivers in terms of being in the right
gear at the right time, which to me is more important than torque
converter losses.

>I prefer the stick for fun and the auto for traffic.

who says you can't have your cake and eat it too?  a well designed
shifter will easily facilitate manual, clutchless shifts.  i am
referring to the much copied mercedes jagged gate.  the only
department where you lose out is in the number of ratios available,
and of course the converter losses..

if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
it can't be half bad..  :-)

These substitutes exist, and at this time are available. Its the future
availability that is in doubt.

1) GHG-12

Get it from People's Welding Supply 800-382-9006


2) butane/propane  

You can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away.
Just make sure you use good quality (dry) gases.

 I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw
the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition,
the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is 
all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years

I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automatics
should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise
would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.
More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery
instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive
always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should
be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.
	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster
that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.  For
normal driving go with the manual.

For an all out sports car, I'd go for the RX-7 without the sports
suspension (which is too stiff.)  For a little more practicality and more
comfort, the Nissan 300ZX Turbo is a good buy.  And for a good dose of
luxury, the Lexus SC300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) 
However, the Toyota Supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,
the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  I don't
particulary like the Mitsubishi 3000GT's or the Dodge Stealths as they are
too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.

You can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
doesn't see it right away...Valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
by Car and Driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
 It also gives the amount of ""threats"" it is picking up, so if you go through
 the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
 number of ""threats"" the Valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
  It's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.

All Toyotas have airbags with a real horn. Come on, how hard can it

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed

The only person I knew with a GTZ had it bought back by GM as a lemon. It
was a piecve of junk, but very quick for FWD.

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k
miles, a rare screw up by Honda.
Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

 Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
would be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,
wider and slightly banked. 

Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)
and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south
east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the
left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled
into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't 
a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.
Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and 
over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then
that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he 
had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and 
changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.
I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out 
of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to 
think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not 
left the time he needed to dodge me.

Rule: Just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,
don't assume it will stay that way.

With the popularity of minivans, the market room for station wagons is 
squeezed out. They are not as comfortable as sedan, and don't carry as 
much as the minivans. 

This is not to say nobody wants the wagon anymore. But the demand is certainly
hampered by the minivan, and may not be economical to build a product for.

Which Western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between

the full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in.

If you are a California resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other than
California without also paying California sales tax?  How does California

Hi there, maybe you can help me...

I have an '88 Corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  The gearbox
seems excessivly clunky.  I used to have an '85 Corolla, and it was also 
somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as
bad as this car!  Is there fluid in the 5speed case?  If there is, could it
just be low, or in need of a change?  As I recall, only the autos have fluid.
Or am I just mistaken?  Please no flames for owning an import.  I also have
an old Dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...

Of course it releases radiation! Thats why your car goes faster when
you punch the holes in it. All that radiation gets on your engine
and gives it ""pep"" (scientific term). You get more horsepower &
torque too! If you don't know what HP & torque are, you can read
mile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. Horsepower
is how much power a horse can make pulling a Subaru, and torque is
a name invented by Craftsman for a wrench.

It is actually simple in principle. Porous adsorbents like zeolite and
activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water
or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  Upon being heated, the 
gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
condensed.  This forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  The only problem
is that the COP is very low (0.2 -0.6).

I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. It's odometer turned 90k
and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said
it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He
said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it
had 77k, I don't know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He
quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30
outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor
is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it
malfunctions before I do anything.  If anyone out there owns a chevy
sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also,
did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealer's help. Also,
what are the results of the oxygen sensor malfunction.

For years you have assaulted others with offensive language, etc.  From

I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to 
hear your comments.

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this
product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.

The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is
half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor
is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against
the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. 
The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.

Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft
of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was 
added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of
torque. 

Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, 
you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.

They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz
bottle is $25.

I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was
so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't
believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against
my common sense.

Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?
If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the 
second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.

Kinda dull - I've always liked 'boxer' - Subarus can use this, as does
Porche 911 and BMW twins (that's a motorcycle for you with 2 too many

It isn't that bad.  At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves compared
to the slab sides on the Consulier.  And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12
(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  Also Ettore
Bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
development.  So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get in
today's world.  Much like Enzo Ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to
take over part of Ferrari as well...

That's funny.  I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. 
:-)

Most GP 500cc motorcycles are V-4s, and the VF line of Hondas were all V-4s
(from the VF-400F through the VF-1000F, including the RC30 race bike and
the present VFR-750F).  It should be noted that Lancia built a V-4 in
recent history in the Fulvia HF, a very pretty Italian coupe.

The federal government has mandated that all passenger cars by model year
'95 return to the floor mounted dimmer switch.

A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has
found that an unacceptable percentage of after dusk collisions were the
direct result of unskilled drivers getting their left foot stuck in the
steering wheel :-)

I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  
S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear, but some people I know have.   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul.

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers
had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K.

In my opinion it works.

	Probably the most famous V16 is the one Cadillac made from about 1925  
to 1935.  They had to scale down then because the Great Depression really put  
the crimp on luxury cars.  It had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
power.  ""They don't make them like they used to.""  
	There were others though.  Packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
sized to their legendary Twin-Six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   
Lincoln and Pierce Arrow might have also had one but I am not two sure.
	Most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
V16 if they did not actually produce them.  There was actually a ""cylinder war""  
among the Big Three to see who could produce the biggest engine.

Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim
=============================================

Background:

    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving
a 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been
interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing
the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a
remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.
As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still
have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.

    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was
already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as
having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.
However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I
can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the
car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum
plugs and valve adjustment.

    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.
The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,
although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small
scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the
highway.

    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit
concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To
my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems
just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)
Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of
the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and
in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit
more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.

    In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up
for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the
ride later in this review.


Engine:
    
    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very
interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was not
disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is
good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although
I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly
-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good
since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
(More on this later.)

    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be
unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit
higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can
literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve
more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and
you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.
The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!

    I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the
tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,
you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than
adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves
are used.


Transmission:

    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they
marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter
into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and
remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the
car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.

    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a
Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the
one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit
larger and more forgiving.

    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter
felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect
it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's
much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's
a clumsy shifter.

    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress
friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for
the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this
pretty amazing in a car like this.

    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest
shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my
Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.
Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line
because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.

    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more
reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works
smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter
upgrade would help at all.

    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears
smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to
match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took
several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems
were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad
shifts in higher gears.)

    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter
refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to 
get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple
of months.

    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500
rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the
engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can
definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,
as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHO
sound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"".
Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.


Exterior:

    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this
SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are
virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes
don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did
differently to the SHO bodies.

    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching
color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the
SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at
stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.
:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely
monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with
""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have
colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.

    I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel
almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and
distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)


Interior:

    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the
car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are
covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in
a black/grey/metallic scheme.  

    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo
and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a
large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest
that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin
holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding
cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small
glove compartment.

    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted
to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a
sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and
thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the
interior was upgraded!

    The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so
much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)

    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From
what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.
Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has
cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the
way.

    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal
hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that
you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to
it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.


Ride:

    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than
any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter
and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with
less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a
noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels
wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I
listened for that before I bought the car.

    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from
Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone
from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively
quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what
exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window
that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.

    Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the
suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way
too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would
advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with
the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason
to complain.  Let me explain...

    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the
wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer
making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I
avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.

    It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.

    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.
My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the
wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when
driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so
useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road
to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better
than the steering on my Celica ST.

    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?


Miscellaneous notes:

    GRIPES:

    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles
        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.

    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as
	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.
	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)

    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension
	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.

    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the
	side bolsters would close more tightly.  

    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I
	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500

    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it
	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't
	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!!
	Pretty ridiculous, though.

    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,
	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque
	down low.

    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It
	took me a couple of days before I could really shift
	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)

    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that
	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. 
	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make
	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever""
	for tips in this department.  :-)

    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once
	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch
	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off
	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car 
	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began 
	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of 
	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed 
	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)

    The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same
    	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the
	other windows work smoothly.


    LIKES:

    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The
    	cupholders are great.

    I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but
	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by
	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And
	you can never lock yourself out of the car.

    I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't
	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years 
	ahead of schedule.  :-)

    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to
	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I
	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines
	and ended up with this.  

    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have
	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this 
	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this
	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you
	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)

    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums
	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice
	the horsepower.  



Other Odds and Ends:

    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.
Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I
haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still
appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always
quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some
of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)

    I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as
well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be 
posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  

    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!
I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but 
maybe someone out there does.

Several company publish periodicals (3 or 4 times a year) which list the
sticker prices and the dealer invoice prices of all the cars and their
options.  Edmund's is the name of one such price guide.  You can find
these price guides at most places which sell magazines.

Having recently purchased a 93 Probe with clear-coat paint, I 
would like to give it a good wax job.  What is the Best type of
wax to use for this type of finish?  Is paste or liquid better?
I would be waxing it by hand, and buffing it by hand, I guess
using cheesecloth to buff it (anything better you would suggest?).

I've heard comments here before about things like Turtle Wax
and Raindance not being very good, so I'm wondering what is
recommended for a quality finish.

Thanks in advance.

Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars.  They have been known 
to be very picky.  No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland 
insurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos.

Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want 
you.  They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of 
my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. 
 ""We must insure all the cars"".  I think this rep didn't know what she was 
talking about.

Geico is cheap.  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped.  I 
think in most areas two tickets will do it.

Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.

State Farm.  Slighty higher than most but very good response.  Not as picky 
as Geico.

While previous Volvos have been essentially very fast tractors, the 3,4 and 8 series

Is this true?  I know that they had done joint ventures with Renault, but I haven't

Funny, I thought the numbering scheme for both Lexus and Infiniti was
related to sticker price more than anything else, i.e. Infiniti G20 (around
20K), Q45 (around 45K), Lexus ES250 (RIP) (around 25K), Lexus ES300 (around
30K), etc.

Is there a conspiracy theory there?

Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range).

The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay 
attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people
to the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples
license for stupidity.

Yo! Watch the attributions--I didn't say that!

Again, this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
should shoot someone for property damage/vandalism/theft, but every
responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits, and the punishment
must fit the crime. I mean, think about it--is a (really) harmless
prank worth killing over?

As I said, the situation described (punks setting off alarms and
taunting people to come out) could turn very ugly very quickly, and
it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line.

	I just went through this mess in New Jersey (I'm still waiting for a

in the lurch.  My recourse was through NJ's insurance dept. Office of Consumer
Protection.  You should have a similar office in your state.  Make use of it.

I would be concerned about how the car was driven and how well it was
maintained.  I own a turbocharged one, and I would never buy a
turbocharged vehicle unless I knew the owner and his/her
driving/maintenance habits.

>Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the

I have been wondering about that myself.  The '90 AWD models and the
'91s were identical (except for the ABS option).  

>In particular, the manual transmission,

Yes.  Some owners had problems with the transaxles.  Using
synthetic lubricants in the transaxles solved the problem in most
cases.  The problem was not unique to the AWDs, however.  It was
common to all models.  The Galant VR4 and GSX had the same transaxle,
but I didn't see those listed in CR.

>electrical system,

I don't know of any major complaints in this area, except that the
battery that was installed at the factory had a low current rating. 

>and brakes were below par (in both models).

The first FWD models (those built before May 1989) were recalled for
brake upgrades.  Some FWD and AWD owners had problems with warped
rotors.  Those of us who insist on using manual torque wrenches every
time the lug nuts are tightened have never had a problem.

>A friend of mine
>ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads),

I can refer you to someone who has gone through a set of pads in one
day!  It all depends on how you drive.  It seems that most owners have
been getting between 40-70k on a set of pads.

If your friend ""beats"" on the car, then his unit is not a

My suggestion is instead of listening to the useless Consumer Reports,
talk to several owners (the mailing list may be the best way to reach
a few of them).

They light the highways in Texas?  Funny, everywhere else I've been
they only light 'em at junctions.

I won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
essentially nonexistant.

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary
dramatically, particularly between states.  I can name a number of
interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
very optimistic in any car.

I'm not sure what you call ""quite severe"" in terms of road deviations
but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be
considered so.  They're hard to take at 85mph.  That's not the only
interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive
frequently.

Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere
has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such
wide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.

Because Greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their
RADAR collision-prevention system. They use RADAR to monitor how close
other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals
a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast
or are getting too close.

This is all I remember from the news reports a few months back; at
the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing
the system. (They didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper
traffic, or how it discriminated between a Camaro approaching at
120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached 
at 60mph on a curve.)

I do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from
flashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red ""Too
close"" light to hysterically screaming ""WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!""  :-)

Several years ago GM was having trouble with the rings sticking on the

not honor warranty work if 10W-40 was used (if my memory serves me).

Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.
As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good
car.

good point.  you would think by now that most car companies would just make
4 wheel disc standard and be done with it.  can it really cost that much more
for disc?  especially when you think of the economies of scale they would gain
by just making them all 4 wheel disc.  no seperate parts numbers and orders 
etc.  btw, the z28 and trans am and formula have 4wheel disc, but the bottom

I'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I've been
doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got
over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?

On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.
To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker & easier they where to shift.

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,
I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless
shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some
times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. It works great !
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles.
Works for me, I must say.

i agree, *never* have the dealer add anything to your car.  if you want a/c
make sure it is factory installed(honda's maybe excluded, many can't be 
bought with a/c installed at the factory, but i think, maybe, they actually
use all the needed parts for a true factory install when they put one in...as
in bigger radiator etc...or are designed properly for this in the 1st place),
anyway, my point is the dealer installed a/c won't be anywhere near as good
as factory *and* the service bums will mess up your car when installing it...
scratches, screwdriver holes in seats...parts not reinstalled correctly or 
with all the screws etc.  i know a guy who has been service manager at a gm
dealer for 18 years...he said never have a dealer add anything to your car...

On the subject of the V4,Ford in the UK used V4 engines exstensively in
their Ford Transit vans.This brings back a memory from the seventies.I
played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
us bought a 1967 ""tranny"" to cart the gear around in.It was in terrible
shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.We spent
days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.
    Back to the engine if I remember right it was a 1600cc V4 and that
thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls
on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.
    When the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
Morris Minor that worked great. Ah fond memories.

Here is a press release from the U.S. Department of Energy.

 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806

   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy
Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a ""driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.""
   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.
   ""I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen,"" O'Leary said.  ""As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country.""
   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation.
   ""The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,""
O'Leary said.  ""Increased use of domestically-produced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe
that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals.""
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical.
   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working
with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available.

	I'd hate to rehash an old thread, but...  Would someone kindly quote
a prices that a dealer quotes for a Civic EX, and Escort GT.  Also, I'm a

someone has one of those yearly buyers' guides that give a low quote price,
please quote them, too.  Then find the the SC1 base price.

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next
Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable
than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.  

The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality,
just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is
barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that
can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line
with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;
it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come
with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're
getting better and making the move in the right direction.

They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only
in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the
end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part
since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't
press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.
Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.

I do not put much stock in the mag rags' ""inside"" information, or even
Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
finally disclosed in it's entirety.  ""Inside"" information had the
Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look
for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself
if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new
car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been
brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those
modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and
competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.
And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,
who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.
Highly.

The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts
way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage
is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and
believe Ford will forfeit that.

I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit
defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,
intelligent, critical spews like, ""The Mustang bites, man!""  Some of
you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro
will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the
differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.
The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its
cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still
reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to
the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while
the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.
Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be
no clear winner.

Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe
that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?

QUESTION: what's your experience with car wash wax?

This is the liquid type of wax in bottles that you pour it in
water, sponge it on you car, hose it off, and dry it with cloth.
Many people have used it. It is very easy to work with and gives
seeminly the same visual results as that of paste type of wax.

But, does it last long? Does it have any negative effects to car
paint?

Can you forward your reply directly to my email id? Thanks.

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in
8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

I really must object to that last statement.  Having a lot of experience
with a '92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of
outstanding qualities.  Very reliable throughout.  Great layout of controls
and components.  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  They 
look sharp inside and out.  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and 
drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven.

All in all, it's a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle.
Please don't knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with
specific reasons why you feel that way.

Okay, okay, I know the Ford Probe is made in the US, in fact it's
made in Michigan, at a Mazda plant.  My question: are most of the parts
from American or Japanese sources?  I have been told that most of the US
assembly plants for Japanese automakers import almost all of the parts used in

I heard the diesels are considered cleaner-burning than
gas engines because the emit less of: Carbon Monoxide,
Hydrocarbons, and Oxides of Nitrogen.  (CO, HC, NOX).

But they can put out a lot of particulate matter.  I heard
something about legislation being discussed to ""clean up
diesel emissions"".  Is there anything in the works to
install ""scrubbers"" for diesels?  How about the feasibility
of installing them on trucks and cars?  Would it be any
different than a catylitic converter?  I'd assume easier,
since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting
gasses.  Let's hear people's opinions...

   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as
    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]

                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions


Tire Questions:

Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?

A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the
    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually
    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the
    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire
    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel
    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'
    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like
    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed
    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly
    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common
    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to
    150MPH.)

    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed
    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find
    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load
    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous
    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is
    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum
    per-tire loads:

    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157
    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125

    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.

    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire
    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation
    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application
    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters
    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of
    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For
    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference
    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at
    all.

    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.

    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating
    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)

    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,
    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded
    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is
    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they
    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are
    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.

Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put
    normal tires on the car?

A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.
    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible
    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them
    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that
    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)
    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your
    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly
    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,
    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard
    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear
    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.

Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side
    of my car?

A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many
    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a
    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others
    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping
    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before
    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the
    car should I put them on?

A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't
    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow
    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there
    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear
    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car
    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car
    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,
    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the
    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes
    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.

Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:

Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits
    in this Q&A posting?

A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between
    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless
    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please
    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.

Safety Equipment:

Q:  Do airbags really work?

A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much
    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than
    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than
    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend
    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the
    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but
    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention
    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.

Brake Questions:

Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas
    always wants to do this.

A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing
    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors
    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped
    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or
    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas
    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical
    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,
    or badly grooved.

Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is
    this really a good idea?

A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade
    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of
    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases
    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more
    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they
    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.

    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA
    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I
    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to
    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a
    car with an automatic to take the test.

Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?

A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to
    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake
    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type
    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The
    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry
    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling
    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest
    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better
    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling
    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see
    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that
    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific
    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly
    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_
    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for
    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out
    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid
    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.

Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?

A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks
    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone
    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and
    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound
    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in
    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any
    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend
    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where
    most of the corrosion occurs.

    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to
    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the
    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.

    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are
    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which
    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they
    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they
    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable
    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense
    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not
    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the
    economics are questionable for street use.

    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard
    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably
    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little
    information at this time.

Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs
    more.  Is it worth it?

A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will
    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer
    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally
    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does
    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),
    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques
    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.

    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the
    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able
    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several
    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is
    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence
    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed
    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and
    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original
    equipment or OE-equivalent components.

    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking
    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the
    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS
    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a
    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could
    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is
    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as
    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are
    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system
    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this
    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;
    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform
    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on
    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes
    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,
    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this
    eventuality.

    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves
    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are
    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release
    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off
    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.
    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.

    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical
    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on
    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.
    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an
    ABS system in your car.

    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential
    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the
    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder
    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master
    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for
    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5
    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of
    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system
    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid
    becomes very important.

Q:  What about this threshold braking business?

A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent
    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers
    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is
    needed here -- rpw]

    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high
    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab
    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much
    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate
    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but
    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold
    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn
    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake
    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the
    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.
    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're
    not very near the threshold.

    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just
    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on
    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very
    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better
    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS
    take over.

    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of
    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with
    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed
    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now
    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the
    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.
    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing
    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique
    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to
    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you
    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must
    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least
    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that
    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.
    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective
    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if
    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at
    the pedal will be sufficient.    

Gas Questions:

Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?

A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the
    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.
    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your
    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car
    needs.

Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?

A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,
    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase
    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded
    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,
    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not
    actually require leaded gasoline.

Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?

A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use
    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.
    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl
    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs
    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.

    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes
    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's
    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider
    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol
    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected
    cars.

    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with
    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that
    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain
    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything
    in your gas tank.

    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are
    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work
    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,
    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,
    once every six months, is highly recommended.

Q:  What about detergent gasolines?

A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW
    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this
    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test
    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such
    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.
    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean
    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.

Lubrication Questions:

Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?

A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter
    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	
    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are
    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine
    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels
    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,
    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.

    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either
    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by
    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly
    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile
    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the
    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;
    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity
    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually
    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What
    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity
    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast
    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the
    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.

    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not
    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all
    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the
    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has
    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils
    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,
    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.

Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?

A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out
    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure
    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on
    your wallet at all times.

Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?

A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have
    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based
    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the
    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,
    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET
    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight
    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term
    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are
    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the
    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes
    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners
    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of
    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50
    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as
    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are
    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.

    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.

Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?

A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,
    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by
    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to
    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your
    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change
    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty
    as conventional oils.

    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter
    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very
    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.

Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.
    How often should I change my oil?

A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)
    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs
    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,
    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you
    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up
    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,
    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are
    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car
    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change
    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,
    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out
    of storage.

Misc. Questions:

Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they
    break.  What's the story?

A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,
    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but
    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.
    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.

    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the
    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent
    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if
    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time
    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have
    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,
    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage
    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water
    pump can be a costly mistake.)

Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it
    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?

A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the
    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression
    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are
    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance
    oriented vehicles.

Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?

A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety
    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be
    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the
    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report
    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator
    is probably the cause.

 Stay away from GEICO.

 A recent CAR & DRIVER issue has an article about GEICO giving free
 laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit
 enforcement.  The article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
 your premium will increase dramatically based on how much ""over the
 limit"" you were.  If I remember correctly, at ""more than 20 over"",
 you'll get something like a 65% increase. 

 If you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped
 immediately. 

 One accident claim and you will be dropped.
 After many years with GEICO, my father who had 0 tickets and had made
 0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  He was dropped 
 immediately.  Since then he has been with State Farm for years with
 no complaints.

 I have been with State Farm for about 20 years - no complaints.

I've been in two _major_ auto accidents, both were multiple car.  The worst
was a head-on three car collision (T intersection and one person ran a stop
sign).  In both cases I was stopped and had no place to go (and I saw it
coming both times).

If you _really_ want to add safety to _any_ car, simply add a cage to the
car.  They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that
four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that
were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little
extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal
level of protection for everyone. 

One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some
training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single
investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have
to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about
autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving
ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two
driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very
worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-). 

Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you
with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at
that.

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed

it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in ""Hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

You guys are correct.  The Bricklin was produced in Canada.
The National Museum of Science and Technology here in Ottawa
has one, and sometimes they put it on display.  Most of the time,
it stays in storage because the museum doesn't have much room.
It's a big deal for a car to be Canadian and that's why they 
have it.  If anybody's a fan, they also have a nice green '73
Riviera that looks like it just came out of the showroom.

Reply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)
NNTP-Posting-Host: lanmola.engr.washington.edu

It's been a while since I've reviewed a car but today I paid a visit
to an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he
makes a not too sucessful living selling them.

Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:


1) Servotronic steering:

[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the
name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and
used in Audis and BMWs.]

I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past
couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of
the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to
report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I
suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been
loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that
I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much
happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no
longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is
ruined.

The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I
suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that
some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and
there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for
improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the
Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in
""feel"" and engineer it out completely.


2) Engine

Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did
not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be
putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific
punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it
encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so
supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2
liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a
fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm
redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which
translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A
chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.
The technical achievement is breadthtaking.

Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In
fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts
are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the ""overboost"" feature
than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features
up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like
lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the
right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a
few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,
maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb
ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to
develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite
a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado
VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding
in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one
is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the
turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very
refined but bland sounding 5 banger..

Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as
serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite
up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that
in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of
harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,
lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark
that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.
The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under
full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more
musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical,
with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can
match its grunt.

The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking
off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra
inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat
delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. 
Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price
to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should
offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in
extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The
characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,
in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the
slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...


3) Chassis

I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively
modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..
which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke
wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge
whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth
watering macho, yet subdued look. 

On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body
style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as
road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I
digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved
out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough
roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers
do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will
never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or
pony cars.

The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to
be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was
able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I
think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,
talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a
banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I
went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the
skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and
completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the
limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were
thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely
uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of
story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those
reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical
efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.

The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty
well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too
surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi
100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more
wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the
luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by
additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to
brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days
seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on
anti-lock capability.


4) Comfort

For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also
excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel
inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected
gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this
and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed
because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the
car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how
much the turbo dominates its performance.  

Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as
well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.

Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't
consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough
to sway a potential buyer.


5) Conclusion

Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price
of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to
offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if
it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker
offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is
worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also 
top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant 
automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series
Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my
thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being
all out exciting and intoxicating.

A friend had a Ford Taunus (era early 60's) that *did* have a V4 in it.

I lost a bet on it. I find it hard to believe there are no *recent* cars
with a V4 in them. Any *recent* ones?

That my be, but every Volvo I've ever owned has lasted far longer than most
other cars.....
1981 Volvo 245....125,000 Miles, still on the road.
1983 Volvo 242....195,000 Miles, still on the road.
1984 Volvo 244....175,000 Miles, still on the road.
And I'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. But with some mechanical
aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with
195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). 
And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has
a 120 MPH speedo...
What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized
by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?

That is absolutely correct.  They have a streak of meanness that runs much
deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height
of the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are
kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the
human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that
have ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity
decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral
humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their
own protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities
and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of
the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

Gee, I guess you touched my hot button.  I'd better go cool off somewhere.

Hmm.  The last time I checked, Villager/Quest does not have a Maxima

V4s? I don't know of any. I4s and flat4s are abundant.

>V6 - Legend, MR3? MR6?

A whole $h!tload. Minivans, pickups, just about any car above the
subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few
exceptions).

I6s are much more rare now; the only one I personally know of that's
still in production is the venerable Ford 300CID in the F-series pickups.
I think that Jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but I'm not a
big Jeep person.

Where are you to not know of V8s? There are Mustangs, Cadillacs,
Lincolns, Camaros, Corvettes, Thunderbirds, all real full-size
pickups, Crown Vics, Chevy Moby^H^H^H^HCaprice ;-), and even a few
Japanese and European vee-hickles with V8s.

Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6

[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]


Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite
automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article
will provide the essential information for doing so on standard
Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups
are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com
for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive
mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can
list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the
Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)

First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,
or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also
important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems
like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you
have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is
probably not good enough.

Listserv:

There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which
is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of
the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this
article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should
probably  look at listserv carefully.

The Alias file:

On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on
whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:

foo:   bar, baz, bletch


which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is
redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest
possible email list is 

my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address
my-favorite-car-request: my-address

this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that
you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can
do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:

my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list
my-favorite-car-request: my-address

Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated
addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,
owned by the list admin.

Bounced Mail:

this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the
members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.
Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up
is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,
by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)


school-request:   welty
school-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/list
school: ""|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school""
owner-school: school-request
owner-school-out: school-request


here's what is going on here:

the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail
coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point
of contact for administrative duties.

school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,
it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending
the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;
the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the

Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.

Good luck.

I went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light

If a manual transmission is a ""must have"", then the M-B 300TE is not in
the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North
America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the
distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.

The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp.
I have an '87 300E, with a ""mere"" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that
it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always
nice, but I can't complain.

I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:

1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.
2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel
   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously ""hook"" into
   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful
   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it
   does not have this problem.)
3) Huge interior and cargo space.
4) The most ""rubbery"" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It
   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.
   I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.
   From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed
   the car for an automatic.
5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does
   not exhibit these characteristics.)

You should also check out the new BMW 525 ""touring"".  This is a wagon version
of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.

W/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  The lockup only
occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve MPG.  Mind you,
a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving MPG, but the additional
mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked
converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.

nice theory.  too bad the MR2's never came with a four cylinder over 2.0
liters.  More like 1.6.  Or did they? were the nonturbo MR2II's  2.2 or
some such?

I also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision
(less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand
pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last
generation Suburban HIC numbers). 

As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that
seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be

saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
wearing no seat belt?

Yes, however, with the top off and the rear window down this car is more

I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40
registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made 
(fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough
to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it
was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65),
and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a
GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION
US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari
that it would blow the doors off of ;-).

I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although
I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify
for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think, 
and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They
also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the
original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was
rear-engine, rear-drive, with the ""bundle of snakes"" exhaust
headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I
can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby
Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

Then you shouldn't've done it. Try answering the damn question.
I am well aware of the fact that there was no mention of the SC
in there.

Well, my point was that the SC and the SHO both have very similar
characteristics (front and rear disks (ABS on the SHO?), high output
V6, 4-wheel independent suspension, very good aerodynamics, 3-point
harness, fat rubber, and 130mph+ top speed). If one of them is 
up to standard (and I think the SC is), but the other isn't, then
why is that? No flamage, just curiousity.

I hadn't heard of the Valentine-1 before. Car&Driver and other auto
magazines
recommend BEL detectors.  I was considering their latest - the 966STi -
which picks up Super Wideband Ka and Laser as well.  It also avoids 
radar detector detectors (although I really don't care about this since I
doubt I'll be driving in Virginia anytime soon - or have any other states
also made detectors iilegal?)

How does the Valentine-1 compare with the BEL products?

I remember this happening on the I-75 through Michigan and Ohio several
years back. A group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,
usually out of state or Canadians. You stop and they smack you with a BB
bat. At least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.
I think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.

I think this is getting a little overheated.  Highway robbers have been a
part of life since the Middle Ages at least.  It's human nature to look
at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have
been a ceaseless part of our heritage.  Overall, life is better now than it
ever was then.  It's just that random individual acts of violence have
never
been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never
good
enough to retain them all.

Organization: Express Access Online Communications, Greenbelt, MD USA

NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net
Summary: Why the repeated leaks?
Keywords: clutch master cyl problems

I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions.
The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout
a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was        
leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid
back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and
got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem
licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months
later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure
there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I
didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch
hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I
would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the
problem.

I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the
pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in
order to actuate the clutch.

My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal,
the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the
cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.

What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix
short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?

Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain
why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the
passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which
the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What
can you suggest here?

Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...

The last V8 in Mad Max is based on a Holden (Australia). Holden is

The Continental may have been the first ""modern era"" auto to mount the

Various mounting techniques for rear mounting the spare were quite common
in early automobiles, both US and Foreign.

Perhaps a nice used '88 Pontiac Fiero GT?  2.8 liters.

Does anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4
liter match?  The 3.4 is supposedly derived from the pushrod 3.1, which was
a punched out 2.8 liter.  Should be a drop-in replacement, eh?  205 horses in
a mid-engine the size of a Fiero?

I am currently in the car market and would like opinions on a VW
Passat GLX.  How does it compare to a Toyota Camry?  I thought the car
looked very solid, stable and European.  Only disappointment so far is
that that it doesn't offer an airbao my next question is, why isn't VW
offering automobiles with airbags?  Should I pay the extra three
thousand for a BMW 318 is even though it is smaller and less powerful
than than the Passat?

Anyone have any opinions on fairly recent model Alfa Spiders ( 86-> ) 

Reliablilty for what their class ( I'm not talking Alfa vs. Toyota corrola
which is more relaible ) 

As far as I can discern, in recent years, there are 3 levels with all
basically the same mechanical aspects.

Subject: New break pads & exhausts after 96K km (60K mi) on '90 Maxima?
Organization: CSRI, University of Toronto
Lines: 43


Hi, maybe someone can help me here...
I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.
The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.
A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me.)

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know
what this could mean...
Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?
Or is this an indication that the car was abused?
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,
I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept, it's currently out of warranty
(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km
worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for
any repair bills...
But, I also need a car for 5 people...  

When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?

I would very much appreciate your input in this.
Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.
Thanks!

Ryan

Dear Netters:

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.
Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the
April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!

In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,
and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine
ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one
stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something
about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem
too bad if one ""beats"" on his car.

I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any
problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.

Thanks for any responses!

Yep.  They are popular vehicles.  You don't see a lot of previous model year
ones sitting on dealer's lots for any lenghth of time after the new ones are
out.  The things sell, they are popular.

Because they are popular, and high-priced new, they are high price used, very
simple.

I knew they were overpriced when I bought it... I knew they had a terrible 
reliability record when I bought it.  But I didn't expect anything like I
got, especially with a dealer network unable to repair it.  Personal experience
has quickly cured me of my infatuation with the machine.

MK48T02 from thomsom.  It has a timekeeper (clock) and 512 bytes of NVRAM which
has a lithium battery backup.  The battery has a life of ~10 years of poweroff
operation.  Installed in a car it could be left powered on continuously and not
draw much current.  The battery would only be used when your auto battery was
dead or had been removed.

In California they have a line on the transfer of ownership form which states
that the odometer mileage is correct.  If incorrect you are required to 
fill in what you know (or guesstimate) to be the correct mileage.  If you
lie on this form and are caught you can be prosecuted and the buyer can
sue you for the value of the mileage differential.

about selling it.  I've said over and over that she should sell it
before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may
actually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability.

Which one of us is right?  Are there MGB affectionados out there who are

In many of our cities, there are traffic signals every 100 feet (unsynchronised,
of course (well here in Ottawa anyway)) and the roads are so congested that 
shifting manually is a real pain in the left foot.  Also, most Canadians are
too stupid to learn how to shift manually (gee, I gotta co-ordinate my two
feet on the clutch, brake _and_ accelerator, and I gotta steer, shift _and_
operate the signals (optional) and radio with my two hands... duh... it 
can't be done).  Also, most North American made cars come with the automatic 
as standard equipment, so why bother with a manual when the car can shift 
for you for no addition money.

Makes sense, since the new Mercedes Benz engines go from 2.2L-4 to a 2.8L-6.
Nothing in between.  BTW, I beleive the numbers on those MB engines are
156 and 225 hp respectively.  The one-upmanship in hp might induce BMW
to create a larger six.  Also, the 2.6 190E has lagged behind the 3-er
2.5 for some time wrt hp.   I am sure the Bavarians wouldn't want to be
""shown-up"" by the Schwabians.

PS- those MB engines haven't been released over here yet.

My Honda Accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now
all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. The latest problem
I am experiencing is with my brakes.  They still stop the
car fine, but once I am stopped completely, my brake pedal
will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  If feels really
strange, and I am worried my brakes will quit working one of
these days.

I checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the
fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).  I called
my mechanic and he told me I need a new brake master cylinder,
which will cost me a whopping $250-300.

I was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this
sort of thing.  If so, is my mechanic being honest? Or do I
simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?

Any help you could provide would be appreciated.  Please send
replies directly to me, as I rarely have a chance to read this

In fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in U.S.

Sunny California is a 1.6l wagon based on Sentra.
Avenil is a 2.0l 4WD/2WD wagon .(It looks like Infinity G20

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not
actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on
real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode
and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does
is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes
sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different
directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its
reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.

I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case
there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I
passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then
the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With
other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.
But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there
was another trap.  And there was!

On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from
a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator
changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where
the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the 
place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector
that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the
car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would
have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar
trap when there was none.

I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features
to be useful and not gimmicks.

Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
And a can of WD40 helped...

The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use
some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...

Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.

Flipped the bottom spring and then...

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 ...

A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  
Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go
to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.

One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block

break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD
been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must 
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move 
it back... hmmm...).

After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.

BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.
At least it now sits level..

I purchased a used 1988 Nissan 300ZX (non-turbo) last year.  I had a 
question on gear/rpm ratios.  Right now in 5th @65mph I'm at 
2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph I'm at about 2900rpms.  Is this about the
norm?  I'm an auto neophyte so I'm just wondering if these are
the proper ranges?  Somehow the rpm figures seem high.  A friend of mine
just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 Chevy Beretta (2.8l V6.)
Also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model Z?
(Not that I would try it but it would be an interesting factoid. :)

Hello again.

Anyone here done any tinting work.  What are the best brands out there?
How about applications...I heard there was a water based brand that s
you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.

Also I would consider having it professionally done, how much around
Wisconsin or Chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)

Thanks for all the info...

Ps.  What is the maximum legal tint limit.

In addition to restricted mileage, many classic insurance carriers also require

   Hi everybody,

   I will buy a Honda Civic EX Coupe.  The dealer ask $12,750 for it,
including A/C ( installed ), but not including stereo, tax, registration
fees.  I live in Mexico, so I don't have time to go to a lot of dealers
and compare their prices.  The dealer is in McAllen, Tx.  Is this a good
price for that car ?  If not, how much should I pay for it ?

   Please e-mail ASAP if you don't want to post.  Thanks a lot.

Are you serious?  The auto that had a lot to do with bringing the term
""boxer"" to the popular forefront was the Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer
or the 512BB. Had a 5 liter, opposed 12 cylinder engine.

Just an comment:  I don't like it when people decide what's good for me...
If you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun.  Who made you capable of determining if there
is ""no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere""?  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business?  If someone is minding their own business, I will give them
all the room they want, and I'll try to make things easy for them, even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).
On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that I'll make life as 
miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
who's minding their own business.  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you:
Self Appointed Traffic Police.
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.

Germans are just more organised; you can't blitz all of Europe in a
matter of , what, 9 months, unless you're pretty organised. If we tried
that, there'd just be a whole bunch of tanks backed up at the border,
waiting for some jerk in the right lane trying to get over to make a

I would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using
Geico.  Not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
to make radar detectors illegal.  They also ask if you have a detector
(probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you).

I know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that
was not their fault.

Well, the MGB is currently in production for the English market, built

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned
this fact.  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather.
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even.  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado.

Thanks,
Eric

It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM.
Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2
liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would
cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).
What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to
time, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,
but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast
as it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up
at a stop light.

Many thanks for any suggestions.

My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can
correct your statements about our Autobahn:

>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.

Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've
heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-
ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car
at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that
he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in
Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is
even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).
What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due
to fear': 
When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the
majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody
fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can
go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).
So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-
posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to
handle it - or you lose... 
That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - 
whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle
a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to
the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more
people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)
and each accident is one accident too much.

>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than

>   far more predictable than most US highways.

Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-
bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - 
a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);
those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals
can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is
that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very
timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.

>3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have

You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -
but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that
in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,
the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding
the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm
used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I
consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...

>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...

Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a
Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over
here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.

I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars
weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at
130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,
it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on
a bicycle: Your're dead.

I'd like to hear stories on experiences with the Hyundai Sonata.  I
know Consumer Reports has trashed them but the people I know that
have them swear by them.  They also haven't had the problems with
them that Consumer Reports claims.  I haven't driven one yet.  I
have driven a '93 Hyundai Elantra (which Consumer Reports also
trashed) and was very impressed with it.  The local Hyundai
dealership (""no-haggle"" policy) is offering an Elantra GLS w/ power
moonroof for $13163.  They also have a Sonata base, w/ Sunroof for
$13997.  I know my preference is for a Sonata GLS w/ sunroof and
4-spd automatic.  I'll decide which engine I prefer after test
driving both the 4-cyl and the V6.  The Sonata is also offering a
$1500 rebate.  Hmmm, that's another question.  Is the following
scenario the appropriate manner to handle ""negotiation""?

1.  make offer
2.  subtract rebate from offer
3.  talk trade
4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price

flat = 180 deg V = horizonatlly opposed

Usually, it also equals ""boxer,"" however, I think the term is
traditionally reserved for 8's and 12's (and firing order matters).
This was talked about here in r.a many months back; I can't remember
the consensus.

Examples:

Ferrari's 512TR is a flat 12 boxer.
Porsche's 911 is a flat 6.
Subaru's Impreza is a flat 4.

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.

>Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.

>And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
>Hello , this is the 90 's ?

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Something that happened in South AFrica about a year ago: A dealer sold a 
Mercedes with an odometer reading of 150K kilometers to a lady. Turned out 
that the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because
lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found 
quilty, fined and had to take back the car.

I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous
owner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.

Well people fortunatly or unfortunatly ,
only the US is experiencing the devaluation of human life (among 
developed nations).

I am an American but I was raised in Europe, where the worst thing that 
can happen to somebody is get his car broken into, or have his pocket
picked by Slaves or Russian refugees.

Of cource there will be some nutcases, but thats extremely rare.

I.e. in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during
the night without even worrying.

In Germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4.00 am and not even look 
behind your back, at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a 
sparkling cleen.

Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying.

I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism
we might get somewhere.

Of course these postings sould be in soc.culture.US but if we reduce
crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates ,thus we could spend
more money on modifing our cars. (Now my posting is rec.autos.tech 
revelant).

not sure about there in CA, but here in US, the manuals are quite often the
standard equipment.  Of course, FINDING a car with one might be hard, but
if you read the sticker on the window, there is usally an additional 2k or
so tacked on for that lousy  tranny.  So you actually ARE paying more, just

things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
I should watch out for?

How about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  These cars
look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato(sp?), which has to be one

Better still, years ago they demonstrated a cold air system which only used
""air"". It was called a Rovax. The unit worked very well, the short coming

1954 MG-TF with frame-up restoration in early '70's - a local show winner!
Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt &
dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise
ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent.
The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is
priced at $12,000.

1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work,
but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and
carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.

1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good
for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make
a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the
upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was
new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.

All three cars will be sold ""as they stand"" with no hassles or haggles.
Time has passed by and it is time to part company.  Prices are negotiable.

Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.

If that were not the case, everyone would be driving fleet rental re-solds...

And while you are considering things (factors in stat terms), how about
city vs. highway driving ratios, owner vs. dealer service, extreme weather
or environment, adherence (sp?) to maintenance schedules, whether the car
has ever been in an accident, number of different drivers of the same car
in a family, whether the car is garaged, warmed up, ...

Water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 Ford Probe.  Every
once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk.  I would guess this usually happens
after a good thunder storm.  A few Qs:

1) Is this a common problem?
2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?

about the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's

VW and Mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps.  Also, VW
uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps
reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the
mechanics of it.

Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being
equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.

It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in
passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
further ahead of gas engines in emissions.

I think you mean ARPA; AARP is the American Association of Retired Persons,
and I seriously doubt that they'd want young whippersnappers building
anything on their backbones, what with de-calcification and all :-)

>to identify the type of organisation.  Internet extended the convention for
>other countries, but the US retained the old conventions.

The general convention is that if it doesn't have a country tag on it, it's
a US site. That includes:
	.com	commercial 
	.edu	educational 
	.mil	US Military sites 
	.gov	US Gov't non-military sites (eg NASA sites)
	.org	anyone who is ""none of the above""
There are sites with such tags that are non-US sites, but they will have
the country extension (eg xxxx.edu.au is an extension I saw today).
US sites can also use the .us extension, but, as Mr. Smith pointed 
out, the Internet was built on the ARPANet backbone, and they default
to US sites if there's no country code.

I would suggest that anyone who didn't know this (or wants to know
more about it on a non-system-administrative level) check out
the book _The_Whole_Internet_User's_Guide_and_Catalog_ by Ed Krol.
(or is it Catalog and User's Guide? I can never remember, and my copy
is my desk at home...). It's a very good not-necessarily-technical
guide to the Internet and the various utilities that lurk on it (including
USENET). I don't think it's part of the Nutshell series, but it is
published by O'Reilly and Associates.

This should go to one of the news.* newsgroups, but damned if I
can figure out which one.... :-)

Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their
clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of
high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics!
Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-)
Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. 

>And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve ""fun."" :-)

I personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe,
with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side
my '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390
with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the
morning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American
Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO.

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For  
crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers  
this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to  
bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be  
abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to  
me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales  
cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue  
to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are  
easy to intimidate.

On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'  
approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed  
price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework  
before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable  
profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to  
it. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you  
after the deal is agreed on.

How about your two big toes?  And while you're at it, why bother with removing

I had a similar experience.  We had a written quote which had been mailed
to us from the salesman at one of these ""no-haggle"" Toyota dealers for
a Camry XLE w/ABS, leather, etc.  The price seemed fair, but when we
went in to take them up on their offer, they ""discovered"" that certain
extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.
It would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we
had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.

Bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
the Toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
don't have to deal.  We walked, went out and bought a new LH car
(Eagle Vision TSI) and I don't regret it one bit!

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.
It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself. 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed
the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.
After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.

Good luck!

Hi all,
I have available to me a set of Metric wheels (came off a Mustang or T-Bird)
which are wearing nearly-bald Michelin TRX 220-55R390 tires.  The only place
I have found these tires is the Tire Rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.
Is there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  Thanks

Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the
basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.
In the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg.
engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is
that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-
aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first
hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.

And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree
DOHC Colombo-designed V-12.  Period.

Ford aimed for 75% US content when they designed the new Probe. In actual
practice it came out to 77% US content. If my '89 is any example the 23%
that is imported may be the engine and brakes, at least the '89 had

You can go to the DMV and ask for their listing.  Although I
don't know where you may actually buy a copy, you can use theirs
for your perusal.  In California, the listing of personalized
license plates run 3 volumes, each about 1.5"" thick.  I hope this

Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds

I have the same problem with my '90 probe.  The water is definitely not comming
up from the rubber stoppered hole beneath the spare.  I have to remove the
rubber stopper to drain the water.  Seems like a common problem with probe.

Sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. It's a negotiation.
Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale
(ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops,
or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated
value controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer 
controls price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled
price, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build 
cars.

Hm... I find this hard to believe.  V16T weights about the same as

Sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your
shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. Don't get me wrong, I love to
drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more
than I've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
of road hereabouts.

While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most
SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds
0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
9-second range.

On the other hand, remember the old adage that a verbal agreement isn't worth
the paper it's printed on.  Once you sign, you are going to have one hell of a

sign ...

Being in the right is one thing, proving it is another.

	Oh, sure -- sorry, but the absence of a cupholder is not gonna
discourage anyone from eating/drinking in the car;  let's just put one
in anyway, so at least they don't have the further distraction of trying
not to spill it.
	Furthermore, you are obviously not a smoker; on a cold day, it
takes a certain skill to toss a butt out of a cracked window without having
it wind-deflect into the back seat.  Also, just 'cause some smokers use
the window, doesn't mean all of us do.
	This reminds me of *one* pleasant feature in the otherwise
ergonomically-hellish interior of the Alfa Romeo Milano:  you could ash
your cigarette without even removing your hand from the wheel; the 'tray
was *right*there*.

	These, I will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake
continental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies 
try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion
in the way.
	Most pitiful fake convertible top: on a ""Cadillac"" Cimarron, with
all the chrome door trim still visible -- not fooling *anyone*.
Of course, there was that Hyundai Excel I once saw...

That would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from '69 to '73.  It originally
had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based
on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear
and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was
limited as a performer.

There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other
models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that
were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer
1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,
and a ""sport coupe"", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there
were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900
engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also
available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,
but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.

In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last
year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations
and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing
to build the GTs.

The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the
Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with
Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and
wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century
low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.

From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by
the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them
Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.

Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the
70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.

Parts are still available from a number of sources.

(I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could
collect in 20 years).

Distribution: na

Lines: 51
Nntp-Posting-Host: ssc.sas.upenn.edu

My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached
the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be
able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
please e-mail or post!

1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,
   there is usually a loud ""thunk"" from the rear of
   of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.
   What could cause this?  Is the differential going
   bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,
   and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,
   the sound is NOT something rolling around in the
   trunk!)  

2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from
   the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves
   going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the
   valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?

3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable
   with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is
   relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to
   the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel
   spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes
   might help -- could anything else cause this?

4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
   3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
   recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
   Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
   through all the gears and then back to park, as per
   Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.

5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have
   4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
   in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are
   they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?

I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners
out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly,
these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted
into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a
junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be
junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of
the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and
Impalas (& Broughams).

Before the S4 became the S4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.
This model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon.  Very rare also.

        Check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have
    the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like
   piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop
   and the bolt. Is it there ? is it crushed and allowing metal to metal

Sounds a lot more like an Opel GT to me. I'd guess that this is on the same
chassis as the Kadett, rather than the bigger Manta - but I could easily
be wrong.  I think the later Kadett's were sold here as Buick Opels.

No one should EVER rely on just a magazine to determine what car they
buy, I don't care what magazine. Btw, I subscribe to three other 
auto rags, I just think CU is getting a bum rap by these macho men
from hell who think real men should read . . . .

Statements like what you said above have no meaning. People keep on
saying ""CU is only good for dishwashing detergent"" or as you
said:""Relying on Consumer Reports . . . . is like. . .""  and that is
all they say. 

If there were as critical of themsevles as they are of CU maybe there
would be some real content.

i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a
little loud, those with 2.2 MR2's i can't imagine any unbiased person
paying it any compliments.  sounded like my ex-dormmate's rusty chevy
chevette.  with the 1.6 i would want to redline it just for the music,
with the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up..  the new
camry 2.2 features balance shafts.  i guess since the mr2 is getting
the axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this..

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is ""only"" 2 liters.. the engineers
had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses.  also, in europe
the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also ""only"" 2 liters.. as usual, the
undiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good)
gets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans
did not.

In 1972, they lowered the engine compression so that it would run on
regular gas (not to mention the addition of emission controls).  The '72 
also added pop-out rear quarter windows...

Alot of parts are available for the GT from C & R Small Cars in CT and
used from Bill Daley's Opel Parts in MA....

One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT
on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
window saying the dealership bought the car back from
the previous owner because of ""Engine noises"", but that
the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those
noises were ""normal"".  I thought it was worth looking
into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this
to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story
about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,
ending with engine noises which she said ""was something
with the heads"", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said
they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of
yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not
the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension
with the Madza 626 and MX-6.

Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm
turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)
but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner
of a Lemon.

Hi Folks,

I recently bought a 1981 Mercury Capri (my first car ever!).
I have noticed a few problems with the car :

	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like
           11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of
           gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).

	2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something
           like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles, 
           it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. 

I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these
problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has
done about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/
recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it
unless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the
car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).

Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond
by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.

Thanks.

Regards,

A mileage chart should be available in the book.  It usually goes by
the class of car you own and year.  Usually you will end up adding a few
hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  Consumer
Reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.
A friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  I
believe it cost about $10.00.

justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for
the dealer.  and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you
bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this 
great 'warranty'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old,
are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?
btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that's right, only
20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.

Well the European Manta and US GT have entirely different bodies. There is
little or no chance that they are the same. The Manta went through several
generations as the coupe version of the Ascona and was OK in its time.

Not true. The Kadett has been in and out of the US market over the years.
The LeMans (old Kadett) is only the latest version.

investors may be hard to come by a second time.

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock
sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,
but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It
works great.

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false
alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm.

I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't
have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm
won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.

This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on.

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to
people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. 
The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.

> I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems

I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable
the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the
alarm is armed/disarmed.  

I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine
flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. 
The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)
than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. 
Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they
had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>

If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost.

If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the
payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this
turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car.

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car.

At least that's how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

But, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and
use less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available.
It would probably not be TTL but might be CMOS 
(wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make 
much difference.
Plus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy).
Good luck.

Whoa!  Watch your terminology.  ""Dealer invoice"" is *not* ""dealer cost"".
You'll hear lots of ads screaming ""two dollars over dealer invoice!!!""
Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the ""dealer invoice""
(also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers
on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers
signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the
salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere
on the ""invoice"" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and
most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,
low voice saying something like ""invoice may not reflect actual
dealer cost"".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual
dealer cost.

Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.
Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that
you want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of
""dealer prep"" and ""protection package"" (i.e. a few squirts of
paint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesman
to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  My 
wife and I got a joyride in a twin-turbo Mitsubishi 3000GT when
we bought our Mitsubishi mini-van.

Right. In the thirties both Buick and Packard had two spares mounted in
wells in the front fenders. Of course that was back when the front
fenders were long enough to provide room. There were a couple of other
marques that did this as well, but memory fades.

I'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  Before
I delve into its innards, I thought I'd check ""net.wisdom"" on the
subject. :)

It's a 1985 Buick Skyhawk (I know...I know)
2.0l EFI 4-banger
auto
35k miles

When I drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
getting ""stuck"" in 3rd gear.  As a result, when you stop for
a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting
for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
to ""reset"" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when
put in drive.  

My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least
likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).

My background is that my father owns a service station and
I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  Please
feel free to be as technical as you want. :)

Definitely!

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won't buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever.

Great = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me

I rented an Oldsmobile Achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a
Nissan Stanza.  They both had automatics.  I'm a manual transmission
bigot but I have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
better shifters than I am.  And yes, they responded very quickly to
kickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure
out which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I don't
remember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50
mph when my foot told it, ""No I really want to accelerate quickly.""

I would still prefer a manual, but I won't delude myself into thinking
that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And I'm very smooth at
shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.

Only if you want to stop. Seriously though, every 2 years you should
have this done. Brake fluid absorbs water over time, the water becomes
steam when the fluid gets hot, and steam compresses. You'll also have
better luck with the longevity of master cylinder, calipers and brake
lines.

 For under $30k you're stuck with (in no particular order):

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform
the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed
fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the
previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the 
dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed 
legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that
the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has
to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer,
and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that
the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo 
was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must 
be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage 
of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is 
affixed to the door frame of the vehicle. 

Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search
(which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Call your state's Department of Transportation/Public Safety/Motor
Vehicles--or your tag agent--to find out for certain what your
rights are. Your state's Attorney General will know for certain ;-)

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better
in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have
no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it
for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.

>than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your

It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway,
without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition
of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.

>drive quickly and they say my Probe will do 130, but that's 30 more

I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried
about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe
GT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.

Subject: Clear coat woes . . .
Summary: Any way to remove fine scratches in clear coat?
Keywords: clear coat paint
Organization: University of Denver, Dept. of Math & Comp. Sci.
Lines: 27

Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars
have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs
that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear
coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has
fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.

Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed.
When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember
from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car
to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my
car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof
(which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before
he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a
haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light
hits the roof at a particular angle.

I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any 
chance of getting the dealership to do something about this?
My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides
a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of
having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?
Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

If everything I've read is correct, Ford is doing nothing but ""re-
skinning"" the existing Mustang, with MINOR suspension modifications.
And the pictures I've seen indicate they didn't do a very good job
of it.  

The ""new"" mustang, is nothing but a re-cycle of a 20 year old car.

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

On the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed 
terms could be thrown out.  The question will be whether the 
agreement contains a merger clause.  See UCC @ 2-202 (parol 
evidence).  If we're talking about warranties, then, of course, 
UCC @ 2-316 should be looked at.

But we have so little information that none of us can say anything 
conclusive.

 It has some of the most impressive performance figures around, and automotive

Eve'.

I am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (R or HR). I don't
have much to spend, but I would like a tire that will LAST. Does
anyone have any experience with the following brands?

	Riken
	Falken	
	BFG	
	General	

There are others, but these I can find here for under $70.. Like
I said, I am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since I
hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. Also, is it true that
""noone will give you warranty on such tires"", according to
a tire dealer?

Finally, do HR tires last longer than R tires (threadwear again),
or is that strictly a speed factor?

Thanks for any replies..

Labour prices for car service are very expensive in Toronto compared to other
parts of Ontario.  For example, there are places in Ottawa that still charge

I've heard in Toronto is $70/hour.

I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just
take it to the delaer tell them ""It's that time"" and they work on it for 4 hou
and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)
I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for
service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have
never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.
Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have
something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only
MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced
if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and
Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  

What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light
bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light
will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't
find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little
and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?

I dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
assured that the street prices for the MX-3 and Escort and (maybe) even
the Honda will be lesser than that of the Saturn you're talking about.
All price comparisons I've seen are based on MSRP and of course the
saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
will do it way below sticker.

While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights,
I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99
didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition
to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another
set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who
don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic
growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out
of the front fender, which incorporated amber ""parking lights"", amber side
marker lights/reflectors, white ""cornering lamps"" (like American luxury
cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators
on, and white ""backup lights"" aimed towards the back of the car when you
have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front
mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's
toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the
wheels turned while backing up.

It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody
awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit
van.

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph.

Since the wheel/tire is balanced off the car i.e. the lugnuts are
not normally involved, how would they do that? I would think that
since the lugs are so close to the center of rotation any slight
difference in weight between a normal lugnut and a locking one would
not have any noticable effect on the balance. I could be wrong, it *is*

I like my power windows. I think they're worth it.

However, cruise control is a pretty dumb option. What's the point?
If you're on a long trip, you floor the gas and keep your eyes on
the rear-view mirror for cops, right?

Power seats are pretty dumb too, unless you're unlucky enough to have
to share your car. Otherwise, you'd just adjust it once and just leave
it like that.

	Wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver, so he
could see where he was backing up???  Although reverse lights on the sides
are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
path of the car, I don't think warnings were their original intents, since they
are colored white.

Well, you can just about set your watch by Honda releasing new models every
4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. The local acura
dealership tells me that the new Integra will be out very soon, i.e. May/June.

Its hard to find specific details as the Integra has been deleted from
most of the rest of the world - I have seen them in Canada and Australia
as well as the U.S. but it was discontinued after the first generation
in Europe. Normally you can see new Japanese models appear in Europe
or Japan first and extrapolate from there. C+D reported that the engine
would be a carryover I think.

Lack of build quality was the thing  I notced on the first 2 LH's I
saw months back. The panel gaps were large and non-uniform between
the 2 cars I saw - the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
Mustang - but not from Chrysler's savior.  I drove one of the low
end cars, and thought it was more than adequate. I'd prefer
an LH to a Taurus from my brief experience.

not a flame, just a point:  I'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel

drivers who are STUPID.  Like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so
they pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real
smart...  This scares me in cities at 50.  When i can't see enough of
the car to make it recognizable, they are following TOO CLOSE.  And 
when i see them doing this AND reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this
is why America has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are TOO DUMB to realise
that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their

This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my
1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)
with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through
4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed
(front wheel drive included).

Concentrate more on ""where the rubber meets the road"" rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions.

An aside: 
I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter.

I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all

should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right

The same place single men do, wallet in back pocket, comb in other

think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200
quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1
or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an
enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K if
you can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not
that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high
quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never
rust.

in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year
old and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one is
not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  then
there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...

if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about
everything too..

the price of parts is a different story though...

This is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering
controls in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible
pattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into
the 20th century, when, in America at least, left-hand wheels became the
pattern. The mule team (or horses, I imagine) explanation, however,
seems to have some merit.

The Bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by Malcolm
Bricklin, who, I believe, was Canadian.  He was the first one to import
Subarus, and later was responsible for importing Yugos, I believe. 
Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports
car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The
Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.
 If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to
design ""experimental"" safety cars, you will recognize the general
appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other
safety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right.

Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the
old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of
colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly
visible, I suppose.  

The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no
motor at all.

Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I 
would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer
""for their own good"" or for any reason other than I was prevented from 
doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a
passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances
of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could
imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your 
chances of being ""offed"" or involved in an accident, especially if 
this ""passer"" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person
riding your bumper is certainly NOT a ""wise driving practice"", it 
only causes the jam to become more congested. 
 
I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the 
road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a ""pack"" 
of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal 
with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their 
pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to 
pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and 
do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I 
feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the 
actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers 
on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  

If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they 
are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all 
else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the 
message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never 
safe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking 
traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty 
or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,
derision.       (Sorry this is soooooooo long.)

Yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.

all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip

But there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.

I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many
automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment)
than the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property
tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior
public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the
government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is 
significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will
argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to
mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot
be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they
are not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And 
Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions
of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back
to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,
from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't
their fault?  Where does one draw the line?

In my opinion, the limited tort option is the best thing Casey has ever
done. Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue
for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met:
1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is
some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)

2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver
was drunk)

3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal
to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever
happening).

You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can
still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited
tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who
treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In
exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save
$150/year.

Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse
people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort.
I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance
companies would be pushing harder for repeal.

Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm.
Wipers are slow.
That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator, 
rotors and calipers, exhaust.
The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange
stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how
often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that,
although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking 
it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it.
So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust.
I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers
what issue?

Although not in direct response to the referenced article, just to set the 
record straight, Beamers are BMW motorcycles. BMW cars are Bimmers. Please,
let's get our terms straight.

Actually, some purists would argue that the only true Bimmer is a round
tail light 2002 or 1600.

This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?

I don't understand the fascination with vent windows. They create a tremendous 
turbulence and noise that makes even a simple connversation impossible at 
speeds above 40mph. The current flow-throuh ventilation, if designed right, 
are far more superior.

  greetings:
  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one of
the kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled a
mould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetle
floorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about the
vw thing i used to own is that it had about 3"" more suspension
travel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-
market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  note
that the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thing
are the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external spare
mounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)
sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped 
hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for more
luggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine a
nut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom half
of it...).
  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stopping
at a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for the
two big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get the
number for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference to
norway before calling...).

later,
kc

  A while back I asked for help in defending a traffic ticket I received.
 In short:
     The ticket was for not stopping at a stop sign. Given the conditions
   I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the
   intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.
   A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left
   and gave me the ticket.
     The officer said ""The only reason that you even slowed down in the first
   place was that you saw me approaching, otherwise you would have bombed right
   through""


  I would like to thank all those who responded favorably to my request for
 help. To all of those who told me to bite the bullet and pay the fine:
 PHGHGHGHGH..

 The judge sided with me and decided that in this case ""Not stopping"" was the
 safest thing to do and found me NOT GUILTY.

  The officer's statement and my account of the conditions at the time (very
  slippery, backed by newpaper weather conditions) were the factors what made
  the judge decide on his verdict.


  Moral: If you have never been to court before and you think you have a case,
	 go for it. It is a very interesting process, and it is there for
	 your benefit. Exercise your rights.

	Yeah.  I don't use the clutch all the time either.  I've done it
with Fords, BMW, Datsun, and Chevy and it works fine.  I can't think of
any reason that it would damage the tranny.  Essentially you are just
doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the
tranny speed and slip it into gear.

	Sounds about right.  I usually slip it out during throttle-down
and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
(usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...

I recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new Camry (not mine,

factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing.  I
have seen them on quite a few cars, but I can't find anything more about
them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles.

I'd like to know all I can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.

No comparison. The BEL is just a hooped up wideband Escort like detector.

The VW ""Thing"" Kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in Mexico and 
possibly South America.  Good luck importing one--  They probably don't meet 
US safety and pollution requirements.  There are mechanics and junkyards 
which specialize in VW; they might be helpful for finding a ""Thing"" unless 
the WWII re-enacters have grabbed them all.

The WWII Kubelwagen was the German equivalent of the Jeep, but was not 4-
wheel drive.  One is on display at the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, Kentucky, 
also the rare ""Schwimwagen"" (sp?) amphibious version, in full-scale dioramas.
Highly recommended!

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is

There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of
engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired
of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year
old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.

But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow.
I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I
still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through
blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design
flaw in the BMW.

 My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I
think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru
dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer
told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.
At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any
SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is
true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car
looks great.

Actually the company, and the product was ROVAC - which stood for
ROTary Air Conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what
was effectively an air/air heat exchanger, and worked pretty well.
The negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than
using freon, and noise problems from the high velocity/pressure air,
all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt.  It
is still a legal entity in Florida, but I believe completely ""dead""..
and there's a heck of an opurtunity to buy up it's patents and restart
the operation...

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.
Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.

Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.
One of magazine writer called it ""Land Bruiser"".  

If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

    I don't remember the formula's off hand as it has been awhile since
I took aerodynamics and haven't used the stuff since. 
The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and
fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater
than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed.
(autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance)
Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that
by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather
complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or
using a numerical method.

anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:

            Cd = d/(q*2R)

       where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius
of the clyinder.
   To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's
width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that
the car would need to overcome.

Hi Javier, (how are things at Corp, my old stomping ground was c-level?)
Vibration when applying the brakes can be caused, on disc brakes at least,
by warped rotors. When the brakes are applied, there results uneven pressure
on the rotor.  Turning the rotors by a brake shop will remedy this problem
as long as there is enough rotor width left for turning (i.e. within spec).
There could be some possible front end suspension problem but a brake shop
should be able to confirm warped rotors by a visual inspection which is free.

My suggestion look at your current insurance card, there will be a name 
accross the top telling you which insurance company you are insured by.
Call information in Houston and get the number of a branch office in the 
Houston area, call the insurance company.

Your rates will vary depending on the amount of coverage you want,
do you want to carry comp and collision (probably not on an 82),
what your driving record is.  You mentioned none of these things in your
posting so how can anyone give you accurate information.

Like I said, pick up the phone and make a few calls, it won't kill you.

   So, how did you guys *learn* this? Is it something you were
born with, or did you make horrible grinding noises the first few
times? (how many times?)
 
   I would think you'd have to have a certain amount of ""feel""

Limited Tort Option will lower your rates. If you choose it, you can't
sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
So you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

I normally have an unloaded Colt Delta in my glove box with a loaded
magazine handy (which is perfectly legal in Oklahoma). For those
times that I'm travelling inter-state, I keep an unloaded 
S&W .44 Magnum revolver in the glove box, with a speed-loader
in my pocket (which is legal everywhere, under Federal law, Illinois
State Police be hanged).

As I've said before, this is stricly for defense; my insurance
will pay to replace my car, but I only have one life...

I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the
power as it is the power they lose (in the torque converter, etc).

However, if you encounter a '93 Formula with 5.7L & 6-Speed Manual,
You'll be SOL, I'm afraid. ;) BTW, I know of what I speak as a former
owner of a 5.7L Auto IROC (1989) and current owner of the
aforementioned car...

The Manta came out in the 1974 model year and was a 4 seat coupe.

I think you mean late '60s.  The biggest change that Porsche undertook to
alter the tailhappieness of their baby was way back in August 1968 (for the
'69 model year) when they stretched the wheelbase.  Besides, some people
actually _KNOW_ how to take advantage of oversteer, and enjoy it.

Yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's

the MR2s were no exception. Now, about large displacement 4s
with bad noise.. I have a 90 Grand Am H.O. quad 4, and it
sounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. Now, Toyota
is coming out with an all-new Celica next year and the Mr2...

""traction control"" as far as the optional feature that one buys with
cars is not the same thing at all as a torque sensing differential.

a torque sensing differential is a type of LSD, but not all LSD's
are torque sensing.  viscous coupled differentials (as opposed to
viscous couplings) are rotational sensing, not torque sensing.
for that matter, so are ""traction control"" systems that use ABS
sensors and pulse braking.

then there are the older posi-tracs and whatever which i am not

I find this method much better myself, too, although I do really
hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
hand both come crashing into my face.  After coming to, which is
about 15 minutes later, I change my clothes (because by this time
all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
down about 20 Tylenol to ease the pain.  Later in the day I then
proceed with refilling the engine oil.

It's just crazy how I try and change the oil on my cars in one
weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice.

I have to disagree with this.  I have a 92 Z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto
w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way.  Chevy autos are reknowned
for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power.  I live 
in the Dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
here.  Now if I still lived out in the sticks like I used to, a manual would be
more fun.  

Safety-wise, an auto is less distracting...I would hate to have to be    
shifting gears while I was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.
Performance-wise, I can hold my own against any stock 5.0 Mustang or 5.0
Camaro w/ a five speed.  

All of this IMHO... :)

This must vary from state to state, because our old company Kemper wanted
to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket.
Only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  Well i called Geico, and they
insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
Kemper.

Generally i hate the whole insurance game. I realize that it is necessary
but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.

One good thing about Geico is that everything can be handled over
the phone.

Hello netters!

I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. 
This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,
 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't
rent it from Alamo.

Does anyone have some info on this?

Is $225 a rip-off? 
Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?
Is the beretta a good rental car?

Thanx

Hello everyone,
   I have an insurance question.

Allstate insurance

SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is ""totalled"" because of 
exceeding repair costs.
Person says ""WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!"" and takes it to 
another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
dealer.
One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
in Pennsyvania.

QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, 
now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?

Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
thing.

One thing that everyone is forgetting in this argument
over the pricing of the SC1 vs. the Japanese cars is
the Saturns ""no-dicker sticker"".  This makes the Saturn's
price low in comparison to the inflated base prices of
the Japanese competition on paper, but in reality, one
could dicker several hundred dollars off the price of
the Japanese cars.

Admittedly, though, here in Canada, at least, the SC2 
is in the same price class as the Civic Si, not the
SC1.

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel.

You will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
(especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do
run it on premium.

For a reasonable sum, you can get a BMW with traction control:
a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.  Since no
FWD car, including the Saab, has this kind of front differential,
since it would exacerbate torque steer, a BMW with traction control
should have the theoretical advantage on snow.  Of course weight
distribution and skinny tires could affect this...

  I would suggest you take the car to the nearest Chevron dealer, with
your own oil and filter.  Ask for an oil change.  It will cost less
than $10.  Watch him/her do it.  Just from watching someone do a job,
you will be able to learn and remember the sequence, and do it right
when you do it yourself the next time.  Besides, when he/she loosens
the drain nut, the next time around it will be easier for you.

  If it is stuck, use an impact wrench.  Not too much force though.
Use a new washer each time you put the nut back.....

CAR just tested the S4 wagon with 5 banger and 6 speed manual.  Rave

development costs for the V8, and since the V8 is not selling well,
they are sticking it into the 100 series cars.. Neat marketing trick,

version to avoid conflicts with the v8 model.. then strip off all the
luxo-garbage.  let the S4 remain with the flared arches and fat tires

know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. And how much
less than book value can you usually get them for. In other words how

Unfortunately, I've got another story to add to this.  My girlfriend
and I were driving through west L.A., and got pelted by a rock just as
we were pulling away from a stoplight.  The scary thing was that the
rock was heavy enough to put a decent-sized dent in the door of my '72
Riviera which is pretty much solid ""Detriot Iron.""  Couple of inches
higher and it would have gone through the window.

A dealer will make money off you in three ways, if you let him:

	1)  New car markup over his cost (remember his hold-back),
	2)  Arranging financing through the dealership, and
	3)  Screwing you on the trade.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at 
""dealer's cost"" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a 
kickback from the bank.

Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average 
retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself, 
try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.

Be careful selling to acquaintances if you ever want them to become friends.

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key.
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release.

I remember my mothers '86 Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door, which was ALWAYS active.  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
dis-able the hatch release unnecessary.

	As a stong self-defense advocate, you're 'statement', does littel
but irk me.  Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your
car is out of the question, but what if they disabled your car with their
rock and then wanted to come kill/rape/rob/beat/ or otherwise harm you,
your wife, kids?  
	I think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation,
wouldn't you?  Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers
more than your own or those of your family?  
	Don't think it couldn't happen to you.  From the sounds of it here
it has happened to a few people.  

	Please do not misunderstand.  The only justification for using
deadly force on someone, is that if you don't, it will mean your own 
death or grave bodily harm.  I am far far away from supporting
vilante justice or anything like that..

	Oh, and if you mean to be funny, please add the appropriate :-)

You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money
do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a
Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other
luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's
out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.

Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can
have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US,
you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an
added safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look
for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.

My $.02, of course.

Hello Netters,

I would like to find out information about a device that is used on vans and

	Checker Motors went out of business in 1982.  It's hard to get
old Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was
a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  If you can get a 
body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - 
Checker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy
straight six and a GMC Truck radiator and a Ford rear in mine.

Yes, I saw a 200 Turbo Quattro wagon on I-287 in NJ on Monday.  I thought
Audi stopped selling wagons in the US after the 5000.  This is exactly the

Rich,
	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq
	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about 
	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may
	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver
	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette
	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it.
	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a
	few hours in reading the ""Corvette Buyer's Guide"" and purchase Noland
	Adams' tape ""How to Buy a Corvette.""  The tape shows you how to check
	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the
	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The
	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where
	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage
	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above
	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several
	other Corvette parts sources.  Good luck!!!

I've had this problem and read about it.  (or at least I assume the one

weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it (ok, so I'm not a mechanic)

I second this.  There seems to be some things that slipped through but the

	Hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  Hm, I'm not sure whether the above
was just a silly remark or a serious remark.  But in case there are
some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data
file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer
a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do
have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is
that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and
buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is
no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration
wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.

	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only
car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and
I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as
Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still
quite expensive.

	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics
and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed.

	- wheelbase 3.15m

Looking at the picture (slightly disguised) it looks like the Ford

If I hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and
taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite
will also be coming with me. It's not the screwing with the car that'd
get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. If they're
taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob
me and/or do other physically harmful things.

If they're just screwing around, no harm done. If they're bent on
mayhem, they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency; a
180gr. injection @1200 fps...there's no telling what today's violent
criminals will do. Death may be the most pleasant outcome...

  The funny thing about the digital dash (87 T-bird) with the 85mph speedo 
limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
read all the way up to 187kph.  At this point the stock anemic 302 would get 
short of breath.  This of course was equivalent to about 116mph (hehe).I bet 
I really coulda confused this thing if I'd toyed with the engine and rolled
the stupid thing (the digits were limited to 199). 

  I've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock w/digital dash though.  My
girlfriend had a '85 TurboCoupe with a digital clock and analog gauges/radio.
Go figure...

	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just
a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650
front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable
and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000)
2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out
of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were 
free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers
i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask,
but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear
axels, ford 9"" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i 
busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and 
haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to 
rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones
that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly
TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were
as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective
wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few
dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were
discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top
for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you
have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over
400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad,
i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over
3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too.
One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a
Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have
a hard time getting up into it.

Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.
If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
the same car.  So isn't that saving money?

Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was
already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:

1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.
 
2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.

Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

Isn't that saving money?

Yeah, People act really shocked about violence, as though it were new
to our species...

What about the holocaust? The crusades? The Salem witch trials? The
religious persecutions of the middle-ages? 

What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
the world? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans?
The Jews persecuted by Christians?

There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. I do not
know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there
were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! The per capita acts of violence are
probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
thousand years ago!

There is nothing new about violence.

Here in Australia most cars are manual (privately owned anyway).  Why?
Not sure, I think it has something to do with the fact that our car industry
in the past was more closely aligned with Europe than the US in the past.
Now it's aligned with Asia.

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never 
seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it.  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things
that don't get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.

Shaz,

Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:
  There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
  initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
  your car. The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and
  as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
  then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
  on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
  
  After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
  computer starts counting again.

So I expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.

I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
indicator.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). But I wonder how that could happen
since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, I thought it's the oil and
not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.

Any BMW owner on the net? Response welcomed.

PS.  my initial question is ""how do you seset the service indicator of a BMW""

i have a grand am with auto and quad4.  around the gear selector there is a

the cover off and cut the end of this long strip to a specific length, the 
strip curls up into a cirlce at one end inside.  anyway, by doing this the 
strip can't feed into the lip that circles it,,,,so...i can push button, pull
down and the gear shifter will only go back to 2 from drive,,,no accidental
hitting first.  i drive around town in 2 to keep the revs up.  shift to drive
above 50 and pull down to 2 when coming up to lights..if i want.  if i am

that will accomplish the same thing.  porsche's tip-tronic automatic can be

downshift.  of course there is an override so you don't redline the engine.

I still can't understand all the hype about the Impalla SS, it STILL has
the ugly Caprice body (Orca on wheels).  The Caprice was the worst new

and a few suspension tweeks are being added.

Its STILL UGLY, its STILL a BARGE.  GM's answer to everything is ""throw in
a V8 and someone will buy it.""  Or ""add some plastic ground affects
and a few stickers and call it a GT, GTZ or SS, and someone will buy it.""

IMHO GM needs to scrap the Caprice body COMPLETELY and start over with a

	I think the Manta is the European name for the ""GT.""  I'm pretty sure
that the only Kadett's sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans.  I think the
GT is just an early '70s to mid '70s Manta.

Subject: ""Production Hold"" on '93 Firebird/Camaro w/ 6-Speed

After a tip from Gary Crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) I got on the Phone
with ""Pontiac Systems"" or ""Pontaic Customer Service"" or whatever, and
inquired about a rumoured Production Hold on the Formula Firebird and
Trans Am.  BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me
nowhere.  After being routed to a ""Firebird Specialist"", I was able
to confirm that this is in fact the case.

At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.
She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some
shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they
simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she
was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,
feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.

Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is
a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was
not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore
having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive
that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.

Can anyone else shed some light on this?
