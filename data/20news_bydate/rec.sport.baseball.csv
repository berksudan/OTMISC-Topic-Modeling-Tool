Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game
with California was cancelled.

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?

Keep in mind this was in Massachussetts.  Today was Patriots Day, a state
holiday.  I think it might be a floating holiday, but given that the
Marathon also happens the same day, most people don't go in.

And Michael Jackson, Jack Nicholson, and Bill Cosby wouldn't be

Will they?  You can't usually take away one of the team's best
players and still expect them to win.  Or do you think the 
Pirates will continue to win without Barry Bonds.

So. Again, Jack Nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens (and much more than Rickey Henderson for that
matter).

The reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they
are on the decline. (There are exceptions, of course. Dave Parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose.)

Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at
least 10 at-bats.

It is early in the season so there are some high numbers.  Barry Bonds
finished last season at 0.795.

I welcome comments and suggestions.

Avery was the #2 overall pick by the Braves, behind Mark Lewis (I think) in
1988.  John Smoltz came over to the Braves from the Tigers, but was developed
by the Braves.  Jeff Blauser isn't a bad player.

Yes, Ivan Rodriguez, last year.  Batted .260 and threw out 51% of the
baserunners.  Not too shabby for a rookie from AA.  20 years old last
year.

Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.

Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!

Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back
in a couple of weeks.  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello.

The regular season of the 1992-93 Davis Tabletop Baseball League has
just come to an end.  To help us with next year's league, I would
appreciate it if you would take a couple of minutes and vote for
our league MVP and CY winners.  These awards, and players' standings
in them, will inflate their salaries for next year's league.
 
Please vote for 5 in each category, in order.  For example...
 
1.  Barry Bonds
2.  Frank Thomas
3.  Biff Pocoroba
4.  Shooty Babitt
5.  ""Lips"" Lundy.
 
Please do NOT vote for pitchers in MVP voting for this league.  Each team
in the league gets one candidate for MVP, and one for CY.  Defensive
position is listed where applicable, along with an abbreviation of
their performance there (E=Excellent, V=Very Good, A=Average, 
P=Poor, B=Very Poor) Thanks... please reply by April 10.
For the record - the season was 144 games long.  Thanks for your help.

Some players missed time due to injuries, others were sat down at the end
to avoid the possibility of injury.  There are better players than those 
on this list, but each team gets one and only one candidate.  Some players
played more than 144 games due to being traded to teams with more games
left in the same time span.  Now, on to the pitchers...

There you have it.  Curt Schilling threw a perfect game during the year,
and Ken Hill threw a no-hitter.  Rob Dibble had pitched 32 scoreless

I've been saying this for quite some time, but being absent from the
net for a while I figured I'd stick my neck out a bit...

The Royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an AL
team since the inception of the DH rule.  (p.s. any ideas what this is?)

They will fall easily short of 600 runs, that's for damn sure.  I can't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division (like our
Tom Gage of the Detroit News claiming Herk Robinson is some kind of
genius for the trades/aquisitions he's made)

I'd be willing to make two wagers:
1) Snow doesn't win ROY.
2) Mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

I'm skeptical of the first, because I don't think Snow is that good a
player, and he is on a losing team.

I'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  Mattingly is 32 this
year, and how many players play until they are 40?  Not too many, and
most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

Could be wrong on either or both, but I think that's the smart way to
bet...

Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting.  Their average
seasons, using their combined average 656 (AB + BB) per 162 games:

         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830
Robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726

Fielding, we have, per 162 games at third,

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954
Robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971

Even if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
total bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about
.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.
The Thorn & Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total
           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating
Santo         123          284        -14       137      41.7
Robinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)
Usual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding
percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,
dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great
career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.
That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

I nominate this last bit for ""Anti-Stathead Quote of the Week"".

Alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive
category, while Baerga, who studied in the Joe Carter School of Out-Burning,
has more impressive mediot stats, largely due to opportunities rather
than quality.

The lines are fairly close in value, but edge to Alomar.

Now Baerga ain't chopped liver, but Alomar is still the man to beat among
AL second basemen...

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is

OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""

Hey Valentine, I don't see Boston with any world series rings on their

I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the
examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that, normally, they would not have had there not been expansion.

Make sense?

I don't personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which I didn't have access to).

The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.

The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a ""this is how
well he hit *last* year, in major league terms"" rating.  So, in essence, he
has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.

If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put

done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training

So what does that have to do with RBI's?  The team with the most RBI's
doesn't necessarily win the game.

Yes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (So why does
every newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)

But for an individual player, runs and RBIs are context-dependent, and tell
us very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and
position in the batting order.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably

Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.

>The facts are that Morris

>Clemens hasn't.

Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.

>You can go on about what Clemens has done in the

>the facts are that Morris has shown us that he can win and Clemens

What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of

great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower
this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and
Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the 
Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  
Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching 
staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the
difference.

On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some

You're right: Thomas, Gonzalez, Sheffield, and Griffey don't even begin
to compare with Ripken, Boggs, and Gwynn, so no wonder Alomar gets so
much attention.

Sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
terrible.  So was his sophomore year.

National League pitchers are ""much better pitchers""?  That certainly explains
Sheffield's 1993, hm?  Are you confusing ""have ERA's that are 0.40 lower
because they don't face DH's"" with ""much better""?

I think he just wanted to get Henneman some work, because the

Your speculation that the two proven veterans will produce better

is cranking in the nl, he may not - ESPECIALLY if it's a pitchers' duel,

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, ""I'm Polish, not Jewish.""

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).

IMO, the Royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if McRae
suddenly began channeling for John McGraw.  OK, they have some decent
pitchers.  But when your offense consists of bums like Gagne and Lind
and McReynolds and McRae and an over-the-hill Brett, you're not going
to finish .500 unless McGraw brings Christy Mathewson back with him.

I'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.

	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong.  
	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here.  
comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.
Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games?
score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer

  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

The Chicago Tribune pitching form has Perez pitching today (4/16).  But

  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you

difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something).

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. 

>Gary's list of ""I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that.""

  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean
Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. 

>That's all for now.  I'm looking at Derrick May's tapes tonight, along

  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month.

This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.

3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
pitching.

>One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the

I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,
Gordon).

  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.

That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond
Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home
last year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the
""Diamond"" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.
If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.  

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too many
expectations I guess.

Perhaps so. I was only responding to the ""Yankees of the 20's and 30's"" 
part of the comment. If those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost, 
then it's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another 
team (not that I did).

Hi all,

I've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or
two without access to really important information.  I saw the 3.5 million
shoulder back on the DL--How long is he out for (i.e. How many millions/inning
will he get this year?)  Nothing personal against Higuera mind you, just
wondering how Bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current
big producers go over a relative pittance. (Please realize the term 
""relative pittance"" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball
salaries.)

Additional questions:  I did'nt get to see Bones pitch this spring--how is
he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?

How is Surhoff shaping up defensively at third?

Are they going to build a new stadium?  When?

my understanding was that ted turner (owner of the braves) started running
his tv station nationwide, and started running all of his team's games on
his nationwide tv station, he dubbed his team ''america's team'' - that is,
the only team (at least, at the time) all of whose games could be seen

now, wor is nationwide out of beautiful secaucus, but not all mets games
are on wor.  wgn chicago and wsbk boston are two other superstations

Subject: Jose Canseco's Swing - 1992 vs. 1986.
Organization: Julio Machado Candlelight Vigil Society
Distribution: na
Lines: 50

Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.

If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was
""Pitching and defense win championships"", and later ""Pitching is the essence
of baseball"".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was ""your 
point"", and neither of which is true.

And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?

It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-
scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

>They should have many 
>low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
>On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,

I thought you said ""pitching and defense win championships"" and ""pitching is
the essence of baseball"".

This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.
His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of
that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the
Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and
judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know

1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988

Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder
at third.

>Zeile, Todd          ----  ----  ----  .614  .593   0.605
Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about

No....Hal McRae is the worst manager in baseball.  I've never seen a guy who

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

The other Jewish HOF'er is Rod Carew (who converted).  

Lowenstein is Jewish, as well as Montana's only representative to the
major leagues.

Undeserving Cy Young award winner Steve Stone is Jewish.  Between Stone,
Koufax, Ken Holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, I'm thinking of the
one who threw a no-hitter in both the AL and NL), and Big Ed Reulbach,
that's quite a starting rotation.  Moe Berg can catch.  Harry Steinfeldt,
the 3b in the Tinkers-Evers-Chance infield.

Is Stanky Jewish?  Or is that just a ""Dave Cohen"" kinda misinterpretation?
Whatever, doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long.

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a

Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two

(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the

       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  
all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  
while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  
give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
of Yankee domination.

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?

I hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).

Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on
the Cards.

	Amazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are
not machines.  Cy Young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum, unaware
of how their offenses are doing.

	The Braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of
cracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many
(if any) runs.  Unfortunately, the Braves' pitchers were so bad for so
long that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*)
on pitching that they completely ignored hitting.

	The Braves right now are looking woefully similar to the Braves of
the mid-seventies.  Heaven help us.

This leads me to believe that it's not really a rabbitball year, and that

Interesting, because the other day, all but three games had ten or more

You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,
and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's
away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,
then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two
seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!

Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I
want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly
sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite
AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:

	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike
	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
	  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20
	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
	  being reported on WIP.

	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss
	  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.

Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it

I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".

In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib

Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.

I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the
East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

Currently, he's all over.  He played 2nd when Deshields was out.  He was
shifted to third when Delino came back.  And today, he played SS for a cold
Wil Cordero.  

His natural positions seem to be in the middle infield, but they will seemingly
find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot.

Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured. Be that as it may....

>1. Roger and Frank are in vintage form, and the Sox are rresponding to them.
Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.

>2. Greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.
This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown
much power yet, though.

>3. Dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.
How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's
Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe
it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as
well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.

>4. Russell is finishing well.
In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?

>5. Fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.
A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of
small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.

>6. Cooper is hitting well (I think he'll be better then Boggs in the field
>and just as good at the plate)
Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the ""in the field"" part, and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll
be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little
luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,
Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).

>If the sox Pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff, now)

See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like ""could run away with
the division"" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If
Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could
be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

I was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch.  Clutch?  Baerga?  The
two words simply do not go together.  With runners in scoring
position, Baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year.  This doesn't quite
*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.

Alomar?  He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!

The difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81
RBIs in 182 such AB.  Baerga got 25% more chances, yet succeeded only
20% more times.

Frankly, I don't believe in clutch.  But if I did, my vote would
go to Alomar for MVP (let alone ""best 2B in the AL"").

Why not? Horner played 130 games in 1985 and hit 27 HR.
Murphy played 162 and hit 37.
In 1986 Horner hit 27 in 141 games and Murphy hit 29 in 160 games.

	Oh, lighten up.  What depresses me is that they might actually 
finish last, which I believe hasn't happened since their second season in 
1970.  Never mind that Gubizca is 0-2 with a 16.50 ERA, Gardner at 7.50,

David Cone is 0-2 (about how he was doing in KC before joining the Mets 
several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed, 
and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten
games than last year, and Brian McRae is actually batting over the 
Mendoza line!

I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I have
for Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could he
start Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year and
the way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Not
to mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top when
Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that
just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is
twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one
of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all
day, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even Arnie
Harris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout while
Vizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in
baseball.

While we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget Shea, which
was designed to accommodate both the Mets & Jets.  It was the first
stadium (I think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.

Of course, with the Jets gone to Jersey (and a truly good football
stadium), the Mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,
because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the
action.  The Mets announcers--Kiner & Murphy in particular--have
always hyped it as ""beautiful Shea
Stadium,"" a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they

WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,

Philly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  


I will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an
Eagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are in
control right now.


About the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like a

the Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-

most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.

>The fact is that Morris didn't ""win"" any ballgames, Toronto did, in
>spite of Morris' ""contribution"".   This has been explained to you

Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.

>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.

You don't have to be rude.

>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.

For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

I have lived in the Boston area for 15 years now.  They have been talking
about a new Boston Garden (hockey/basketball) since I've lived here.  One
day the ""last hurdle"" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new
hurdle.  Fans have been grumbling about Foxboro Stadium (or whatever it's
called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary
proposals for a new stadium.  Local politics prevents anything from being
done in a timely fashion.  There will not be a new ballpark in my
lifetime.

There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like
Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch
of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is 
$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
of the best teams in the majors.

Tom Prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  Think of him as a young Dann
Bilardello.  I can't begin to fathom why the Pirates have been so afraid of
losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates
released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then
eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep.
He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't
clear waivers now?  Why would they care?

the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year

You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense.

That's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively.)

Not the first.  RFK, olim DC Stadium, was built 2 years earlier.
Nowadays they don't move the seats back for the few exhibition
games; but the 3rd-base/LF lower deck used to move.  It was all 
metal, which was pretty noisy on Bat Day.

It's vastly better than it was before they fixed it, though.  Back in

    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:
Morning show:
  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, 
and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of
sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 AM to 12 Noon:
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 Noon to 2 PM:
  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia 
spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0
score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2PM to 4PM:
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided
in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which
are often hilarious.  

4 PM to 7 PM:
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  
I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he
was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there
is a game on that night, but you will see later for the 
reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.

7 PM to Midnight:
  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)
On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets
Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the
west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.
(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))
During the summer, it
is all talk on WIP.


Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with
the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and
12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

Finally, an objective source.  Alomar's a great player, but so is Baerga.

Am I supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down? Just wondering.
I do this as a service to the entire baseball world on USENET, especially
for those in the East Coast who can't get final scores for West Coast games
in their newspapers or late TV newscasts. This is helpful to fans in other
countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. Also,
many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
available through BBS's or some pay news services. By the way, mine is free
of charge and has no copyright restrictions.

>if you want to send updates and scores, set up a private mailing list
>and use that.

Remember I only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. Other than that, everything is done through
private e-mail. Currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. And the list
grows by an average of 35 people a day.

If people on USENET really don't want to see the postings I do to
rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. If the response
is overwhelming against the posts, I won't do it anymore. 

Thanks for your time.

Don't you GUYS think so?  I mean, c'mon!  What the heck are women doing
even THINKING of getting into baseball.  They cause so many problems.  Just
look at Lisa Olson.  Remember that feisty reporter that entered the New
England Patriots locker room?  She started crying like a LITTLE GIRL!  I
just don't think women belong in a man's sport.  Before you smart guys
flame me for this, I know the given example was about football.  Who cares?
 It still applies to other MALE sports.  How can we have women umpires? 
Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on the
face of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to
ump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef, you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.
Besides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a
foul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat. Or Jose Oquendo's bat. Either way, there
are too many complications.

These people were very silly.  Any team that gets to the World Series
can win the World Series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy.  If you put the best team in baseball in the Series against
the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the Series, though the odds
would certainly be against them.

I Love it how all of these people are ""blaming"" the Phillies success 
on a weak division.  Why don't we look at the record of the teams in 
each division (READ: Inter-Divisional Play), we'll see that the East 
is really kicking the shit out of the West.  I know it is early, but 
that is all we have to go on.  Atlanta is just so strong with their 
.188 BA, Cincinnati is 2-7 coming off a sweep at Veteran's Stadium in 
Philadelphia, and Houston was swept in it's first three games by the 
Phillies in the Astrodome.  That, my Western Division friends, shows 
that the three best teams in your division may not be as strong as you

Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. 
These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing
money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce.  Could you imagine
IBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League
Baseball does?  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
that they are too far from it now :-).  What would happen at GM?  Where
would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game.

Forget it.  Word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
a done deal.  It has to be decided soon since negotiations with the

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

I haven't been following the previous HR's.  But there are two, that I saw
live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).  
1) Rick Monday's HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981.
It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter.
Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so
far.
and
3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!

Actually, I could care less what his salary is.  It has something to do
with the fact that we live in America, and everyone is entitled to
whatever he can legally obtain.  If Sandy Alderson and the Haas family
willingly negotiate a salary of $35 million per year with Rickey, I couldn't
care less.

But what REALLY GETS MY GOAT is the bullshit he spouted in spring training,
about `Well... sometimes I may not play as hard, or might be hurt more
often, in a place where I'm not appreciated'.  This quote was in the Chronicle
about the second week of camp, and strongly suggests that he was going to 
dog it all year if the ownership didn't kiss his butt and ante up some
more money.  For God's sake, Rickey, you signed a contract 4 years ago,
now honor it and play!  

Say all you want to about Steve Garvey, and believe
me, I hated him too, but at least when he put his signature on a piece
of paper he shut his mouth and played hard until the contract was up.

I don't know if you could call him rushed, but ""Big"" Ben McDonald didn't
much time at all in the minors. Of course that was because the balls used
in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go
on the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors.
Of course Gregg ""Wild Thing"" Olson and Mike ""Deserved a Cy Young"" Mussina
didn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers
are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;
it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did
keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

There was an article on Jewish major leaguers in a recent issue of ""Elysian

it had an amazing amount of research, with a long list of players and a

Do you mean Juan Berenguer?  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season.  Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.

Anyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  I don't know much
about McMichael (was he the Mexican League guy?), but
everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
Mercker.

He's got the talent to be the 4th starter now, and evetually the ace.
He was a higher ranked (and generally better) prospect than Arthur

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as
far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the N.L. standings:

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    -
Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2
St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2
San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2

This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies'
season:

Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser)
9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4)
9/2   2-1   Houston         5 1/2     Short (15-7)
9/3   0-6   Houston         5 1/2     Bennett (9-12)

      1-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise (5-3)
9/8   2-3   Los Angeles     6         Mahaffey (12-7)

            (Cardinals take over 2nd place from Cincinnati)
9/10  5-1   St. Louis       6         Short (16-7)

            (Giants move into a tie for 2nd with St. Louis)
9/13 4-1/10 San Francisco   6         Bunning (17-4)
            (Cardinals back in sole possesion of 2nd place)
9/14  4-1   Houston         6 1/2     Short (17-7)
9/15  1-0   Houston         6         Bennett (12-12)
9/16  5-6   Houston         6         Bunning (17-5)
9/17  4-3   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Wise; Schantz (2-4)
9/18  3-4   Los Angeles     6         Short; Baldschun (6-8)
9/19 3-4/16 Los Angeles     5 1/2     Bennett; Baldschun (6-9)
9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)
            (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)

Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ...

9/21  0-1   Cincinnati      5 1/2     Mahaffey (12-9)
            (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place)
9/22  2-9   Cincinnati      4 1/2     Short (17-8)
9/23  4-6   Cincinnati      3 1/2     Bennett (12-13)
9/24  3-5   Milwaukee       3         Bunning (18-6)
9/25 5-7/12 Milwaukee       1 1/2     Short; Boozer (3-4)
            (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th)
9/26  4-6   Milwaukee         1/2     Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5)
9/27  8-14  Milwaukee      -1         Bunning (18-7)
            (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st,
             Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd)
9/28  1-5   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Short(17-9)
            (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd)
9/29  2-4   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Bennett (12-14)
            (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st)
9/30  5-8   St. Louis      -2 1/2     Bunning (18-8)
            (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds)
10/1  4-3   Cincinnati     -1 1/2     Short; Roebuck (5-3)
            (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game)
10/2  Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back
10/3  10-0  Cincinnati     -1         Bunning (19-8)
            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)

Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:

                 W     L    GB
St. Louis       93    69    -
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

This talk about the Phillies winning the NL East is scary.  VERY
scary!  Don't get me wrong, Im a Phillies fan but as late as last
year they looked helpless.  The funny thing was they did have a lot
of injuries in '92 spring training that basically killed their
chances.  Of course, don't forget the Dykstra wrist injury in the
first or second game?

I wish I hadn't sold my copy of Jewish Baseball Stars.  It's a Short Shelf

a lot of batters lean in when pitches come.  rickey's crouch tends

Well Sherri, I'd agree with you except that most 'kiddies' have more sense than
to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults..

I try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools,
they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
computers, but I'm telling you, it's gotten to the point that I don't even edit
the files anymore, just read them and throw out the trash...  And thanks to all
you people that think it's wonderful to include a swear word or two in your
signature files, that's really nice...  I have to read the whole article and
then toss it out because of the .sig.  Don't get me wrong, I know all the words you
do, (and I've even made up some of my own!) or I wouldn't be able to edit them out ;^)
but this just doesn't seem to be the place, a public forum, to spew foul language,
sorry..

Thanks to all you people that keep in mind, there might be some decent, young
people, interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup..  They enjoy
your articles.

Maybe I'm just a child of the 80's, but I really liked the Marlins' uniforms.
The helmets shine nicely in the sun.  It's enough to make me a fan.

        Remember - it's still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his
defense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either
last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and
Tony (I'm not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree
though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.

All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder
after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold
night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than
let him pitch.  He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation
(expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants).

I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained
about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,
and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.
Or so I thought.

I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was 
a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but 
everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are
CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. 

The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence
are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top
of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the
bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic 
old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.

These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real 
businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just 
like he used to tell his checkers, ""If the customers don't come back, I don't
need as many checkers"". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent
businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.

I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion 
dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for
the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned
the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there
was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say ""Go to
the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help"".

All in all, it was a fun day

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly

>Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  

""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.

One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis.  That may be ""good business"", but that doesn't mean I don't
loathe them for it.

     Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced
Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to
win.
     ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this
division.""
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't
afford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked and said: ""Well, maybe
Davis will get decked once.""
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.
     ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.""
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I

Stankiewicz?  I doubt it.

Koufax was one of two Jewish HOFs: the other is Hank Greenberg.

Other good players: Buddy Myer, Johnny Kling, Norm and Larry Sherry,
Ken Holtzman, Saul Rogovin, Ed Reulbach.  

There have been over 150 Jewish major leaguers.  A few years ago there
was an article about someone who keeps track of this in Spy magazine;
the article was entitled ""Jews on First,"" of course.

There have also been at least two books on the subject.

You obviously did not watch the Twins in Chicago.

No cold spell?  It's been snowing most of the week in Minnesota.

I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about
1993, you know.

If that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting 
acclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant?

For a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or
are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?

Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith
Mitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?

Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now
his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your 
point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
Duh.

Well, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how 
good Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one
of us runs a baseball team.

	No, no no. The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much
like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the
ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on
many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned
above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and
Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed
up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact
the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can
keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though. I enjoy watching Toronto fans
suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)

Scot.

Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is
ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them, at AAA.

Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play
second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.

Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put
in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he
would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please
let me know.)

But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-
of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. 

Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for
Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was
awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.

Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps.
It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.""
You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.

Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,
Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,
IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.

""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.
Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player
has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH
are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace
Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.
(Got that, Mike?)

And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?

>goodness.  Do you believe the other poster who thinks Lopez
>is being held down because of his future earning potential?
>Why on earth do you people thinkthe Braves made this decision?
>Are they idiots who have built this ballclub?  Jeeeesh...

Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted 
collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,
Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

>And *I'm* the treasure...

You're mostly polite; make defensible, if flawed cases; have wit and
have, in the past, admitted being wrong. That does qualify you on r.s.b.
We'll make an SDCN out of you, yet :-)

Blue Jays? No way hell, but the yankees probably do. Remember, the Yankees  
had the best record of any team in the 80's, and probably take the 20's  
through 60's as well.

Summary: Marlin fans

I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me.  

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field
in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans.  

The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the
AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.  

Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement.  We'll find out Friday how Denver
Bronco fans respond. 

Phillies are 2-0! (I better say it now before my opportunity passes
by)

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first

my scorecard at home).  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome

promising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the

Dunno about Miller.

If you mean Scott Erickson, currently the reigning Twins Least Consistent
Good Player, he pulled a muscle in the neighborhood of the rib cage that
made it essentially impossible for him to pitch temporarily, and is

I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team""
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

Since I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964.  That year,
the Dodgers were several games out of first and I think finished sixth in the
league.  This was kind of odd because they won the World Series both the
previous year and the following year.

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year.

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way

Realizing the taterific importance of this work, John Palmer and I
concluded that we might be able to pool some resources. I have not yet
gone through the archives that Jonathan sent to me; when I do, I will
send out an ""official"" introduction to the Deep Drive Derby.

However, I wonder if we need to rename the project, now that the
principal investigator and research archive have changed. Send your
suggestions for a rename of the study to me, at the address given
above.

And, just think:  it's opening day.  Soon, the balls will be flying
out (no, get your minds out of the gutter) of the ball parks, and
helpless bystanders will be injured by balls reentering the
atmosphere. (and you thought that meteorite showers were made of
rocks!)

Who will be the stars this year? Can anyone hope to combat Brad
Arnsberg's record start to last year?

The season is young, the balls newly rubbed in mud, the hot dogs
starting to boil for the rest of the year. Play ball (and take cover).

And may all your sliders hang.

I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,
Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)

I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to

so gloomy?

No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when
the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.

Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
six-year free agent before the 1992 season.

Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.

But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life
of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.

>11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.

But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him.

He certainly wasn't last year.

Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.

If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.

It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future.

Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I

this?

I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to
blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I
*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is

Clemens is going on his normal four days' rest (last pitched Saturday). 
Hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing
since an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty
rested to go in his expected turn this Saturday, as the 5th starter.  Not
that this is a good thing, of course.  I'd like to see a well-managed
four-man rotation with this team...

Well, no problem!  But I get pretty annoyed when they swing at non-strikes

Subject: Hits Stolen -- Second Base 1992
Summary: Stolen Hits for all second basemen
Keywords: second defense
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 117

Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

More discussion --

DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)
Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Sorry, but this is the biggest load of bunk I've seen in a while. 
a) The Pirates have been trying to trade LaValliere for some time now.
Nobody was even vaguely interested.
b) Several other teams had made it known that they would grab Prince,
who was out of options.
c) LaValliere's release had nothing to do with him being through. He
was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught,
LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday
catcher.

Since Slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties,
the offense should actually improve with this move.

Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching
staff?  Why not make it easier for them?  

In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate
for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the 
wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot 
yourself are insurance against the ""Shit happens"" aspect of baseball.

Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of
the 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench-
Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.

Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.

Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.

Incaviglia which was literally at Inky's neck, and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, Clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or
even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard,
some 70 or so feet about the Green Monster (over 100 feet above the
ground total!)

truly an amazing shot.

Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right, moved to second on ""Bob"" Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.

Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by ""drawing the line"" (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:

Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.

The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,
was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie
year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.

Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had
good numbers immediately.

I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and
Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it
didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching
well initially, though I don't have stats handy.

Hrm. Sandy Alomar, 24 year old rookie: 132 games, .290/.326/.418. Threw
out a few baserunners. Benito Santiago, 22 year old rookie: 146 games,
.300/.324/.467. He threw out a few baserunners, too. Ivan Rodriguez,

True. Which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the
few. Lopez' season last year, adjusted to major league equivalencies, was
.306/.330/.472, 15 HRs. How bad does he have to be behind the plate for that
to not be better than Olson's .238/.316/.328?

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which
is not noted for its sports coverage, but occasionally the print some
interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of ""Like a Rolling Stone"")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said ""Beware Cone, he's bound to roam""
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of ""Highway 61"")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of ""The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter"")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He's sit in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have the Tampian of the world!

     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.  For the last
couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms,
or at least very similar.  The home jerseys had the team nick name
(Blue Jays or Pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city
(Toronto or Pittsburgh).  I believe this is the way most teams design
their uniforms.

While I enjoy the trend towards the more classic style of uniform - 
and I disagree with the person who wants a return to the non-gray road 
uniforms - it should be remembered that one of the, if not THE reason 
for the redesigning of uniforms, especially hats (re: the new road all 
green A's caps and the cardinal navy blue road cap), is the marketing 
money to be made in sales of new merchandise.

Rogers is the ""one-batter lefty"" in the bullpen.  Dusty has also said he
trusts Rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where Beck is
unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for Kevin.  Then again, if
any of the regular rotation falters, Rogers is a possible candidate to
start, though this would appear less likely now that Dave Burba did well
in an emergency start.

I'm no Kingman fan.  Just thought I'd point out that he's the
only player in history to have five three-HR games.  Joe Carter

Ruth, Mays, Foxx and Dawson two each.

I am fortunate enough to have tickets for an Orioles-Red Sox game in  
Baltimore on Saturday, July 31st.  I haven't been to the new park,
and I was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips  
or anything helpful about the place so that I can enjoy every moment spent
there.
For instance, what time do the gates open?  Do we see the Orioles take BP?
When will the Red Sox take BP?  Anything you can tell me would be 
appreciated.  Thank you in advance. 
Please respond to my e-mail address.
I know it's still three-and-a-half months away, but I'm psyched!

Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put
down Braves fans.  I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive
world series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to
all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that
infernal cheer that they have.  

However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The
way I see it, either I'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation
was just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)

Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs
would finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)  
These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective
division.  Well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little
less vocal now.  I wonder why.

Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is
going to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have
good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just
have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, they'll do it without the
benefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the
pennant is going to go to the West.

Just had to get that off my chest.

I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff
Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame.

I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.

I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back
problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're
cold, its a hitch.

The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses
track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he's changed his stance so much.

I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits.

OK, the Mets and O's are good examples, but what about the '90 Reds?  Do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the A's?  I know people who
didn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the Series.  We proved 
them wrong, though, didn't we?

As for this year, ignore their record now.  They've had a rocky start, and
that has nothing to do with Colorado.  They shall rise again.  The hunt for
a Reds' October continues. (with all due respect to WLW)  Bye.

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?

who cares? he had two of them before he came to Toronto; and if the

your logic is curious, and spurious.

there is no reason to believe that Viola wouldn't have won as many games
had *he* signed with Toronto. when you compare their stupid W-L records,
be sure to compare their team's offensive averages too.


now, looking at anything like the Morris-Viola sweepstakes a year later
is basically hindsight. but there were plenty of reasons why it
should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher, based
on previous recent years and also based on age (Frank is almost 5
years younger! how many knew that?). people got caught up in the '91
World Series, and then on Morris' 21 wins last year. wins are the stupidest,
most misleading statistic in baseball, far worse than RBI or R. that he
won 21 just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs.

the only really valid retort to Valentine is: weren't the Red Sox trying
to get Morris too? oh, sure, they *said* Viola was their first choice
afterwards, but what should we have expected they would say?

} And don't tell me Boston will win this year.  They won't

if this is true, it won't be for lack of contribution by Viola, so who cares?

  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of
Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked 
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 

  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. 

  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.

I would assume that the words (I saw the picture) indicated that those

of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked ""NOT FOR 
BASEBALL"", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.   Now, if 
they should happen to reach the post-season, I would imagine that they 
would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry 
of the future.

But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  If you believe in
clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with RISP.  If you want to
see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  

In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But
why use them when so many better stats are out there?

If nobody will sign him for his asking price, he will be the one hurting.
The A's will still win without him.

Remeber, many of these athletes have NOTHING if not for their athletic 
ability.  NOTHING.  They are getting paid MUCH more than most hard working
citizens, and they are complaining of not enough pay.

I don't have a problem with them making millions.  My problem is when the
say they aren't being paid enough, when they already get 3 million--also,
their numbers get worse.

I'm from Dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that WFAN has a bunch of 
Hoodlum Mets fans.  During the football season, the local cowboy station here 
had the WIP on several times for simultanious broadcasts.  I have never heard  
a bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial

be in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

 the person is on the list longer than the specificed time

  I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't

It's always possible, but if this is the case, I think that there is some

Judging by the way the Reds' pitchers have performed thus far, it

Greg,

    The story goes like this:

       Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.
But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely!

      Don't feel too bad for him.  He's still gonna get theat $4,000,000
over the next two years -- he'll be able to do most of what he wants to
do.

using Earl Weaver Baseball II with the Comm. Disk II and we need the stats
for the 1992 season. (Preferably the 1992 Major League Stat Disk) We have
the '92 total stats but EWB2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200
inning games because the Comm. Disk turns total stats into vs. L's stats
unless you know both right and left -handed stats.

	So, if anyone has the EWB2 '92 Stat Disk please e-mail me!

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did 
Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,
Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the 
numbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.

  Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,
I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this
weekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, 
but I thought ""Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?""  

  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believe
that's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down to
Wrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone
(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on: 

  1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the 
     best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or  
     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. 

  2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or
     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and 
     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's 
     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office
     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  

  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? 

  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the 
     bleachers? :-)

Interesting article, Craig.  It's amazing how hard it is to get baseball
teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
customers.  No other business could ever get away with the 19th century 
attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  I guess the
owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary
to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't
realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game
and its fans.

This is what Jackson looked like in 88-91, with everything converted
to a neutral park, on the basis of run production. His equivalent
average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So
let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level
of play.

That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave
Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,
an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what
Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;
just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan
Klesko's MLEs. 

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a
good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.

Tigers' manager Sparky Anderson gets his 2,000th career win as moments ago,
the Tigers completed a two game sweep over the Oakland A's at Tiger Stadium
by beating the A's 3-2. Here are the highlights:


				R    H   E    
             Oakland		2    9   0
	     Detroit            3    7   1

Chad Krueter scored Skeeter Barnes from 1st with an RBI double in the 
bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the
Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo
homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the
7th for the other Tiger run.

John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting
through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas
in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was
replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and
finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while
Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.

In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It
was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

Considering the circumstances, I think it might be appropriate to say:

                WOOF!      Go Tigers!

Yeah, if the Tigers can keep scoring 20 runs a game.  If I'm reading all this  
woofing correctly, one midseason slump is going to pull this team out of  
contention.  Like Yogi says, I'll believe when I believe it.

Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the 
fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no ""kncukle""
to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.  I wonder if 
Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the

	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's

He was picked up by the Jays, but had to be offered back to the Braves
before they were able to send him to the Syracuse Chiefs.

	One report says that the Braves took him back and assigned him
to Richmond. The other says that he is on the Chiefs' roster. Which one is

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.

Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.

I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

							April 1, 1993


I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

Your comments will be appreciated.

As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox
fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives, or both.  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a 
team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  

Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The
fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,
remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far, let alone beat Baltimore.

Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.

Mr. Hernandez Ñ-
  
   I apologize for the misunderstanding.  I explained that I know that it
is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them
elsewhere.  I have no problem with what you do, posting scores AFTER the
games have been completed.  However, like I said earlier, I don't think it
is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others
have come to practice.

KC(?) news was doing a report on that.  They said that McRae is
really a batting coach and not a manager.  But for some reason
he took the job.  Whatever the reason, the Royals need a new

In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?

The O's just lost to the Rangers a few minutes ago I was not too happy about
the pitching of Rick Sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) This puts
me in remembering the 1990 O's season. After '89 we didn't do much over
winter and we wound up in 5th. Now I know that Mussina, McDonald, and Rhodes
are better pitching prospects than Ballard and Milacki but are any other
Oriole fans scared out there?

Admiral Steve C. Liu

P.S. Other scores as of now.
Cincy over Montreal, 2-1 I think
FLORIDA IS LEADING LA 6-3 IN THE 8TH!
Braves vs. Cubs, 1-0 in the 8th. Futility of Cubs batting haunting them.
Yanks beat the Tribe I believe.

Summary: OPCY is just too small...

Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history
if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a
definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.
Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's
could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like '89). 
	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching
staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.
	Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.

Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East
is back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O's
and the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best
team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The
Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf
teams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As
for the Rockies, who knows?
   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to
free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have
the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never
forget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't
hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a
lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam
Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team
intact.

My predicted finish:
1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)
2. NY Yankees
3. Toronto
4. Milwaukee
5. Detroit
6. Boston
7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)

Just a little something I found while reading the Village Voice, which

interesting features.  This year, the predictions/team analyses for
the 1993 season were presented in the form of Bob Dylan lyrics.  I
don't have the article in front of me, so I'll only give the memorable
ones here that I remember and know the melody to.  I could dig up more
if there is interest.

Yankess (to the tune of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of ""Like a Rolling Stone"")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said ""Beware Cone, he's bound to roam""
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of ""Highway 61"")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of ""The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter"")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees
all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive
calculation, I thought this did pretty well.

Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians
""led"" with 76 wins, the Red Sox ""trailed"" with 73 wins.  None were
horrible, but four were five or more games below .500.

Not clear to me at all.  I'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
4-1 games than 2-1 games.  In the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 4-1 game.

Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.

>2.  Who is playing short and third?

Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but 
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is 
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry 
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags.

Back in September I was listening to WIP, and I remember the morning
guys were talking with Mayor Ed Rendell.  The topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the Phillies.  The location for this new park
was suggested to be near 30th St Station.  At the time, the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  Has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?
I know the city of Philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the
new convention center and the upcoming Spectrum II.  But it would be
nice to see this a reality.  It is planned that the Phillies leave
the VET and leave it solely to the Eagles (and if that's the case,
the Eagles should make the VET a grass stadium, but that's another
story).  I want to see that day!

Me, too... RBI are a worthless stat. Of course, so is stolen bases because 
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. And of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,
so batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  Hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then, either.
My point? RBI might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. And no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. Maybe no stat CAN tell me,
either, but some people are... I just know it!!! 8)

Street Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street,
I think.  I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be
build practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used,
according to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble,
because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
accomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting
everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.
Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because
nobody wants to pay for it :-)

	Is this the book by Bob Klapisch (spelling?), ""The
Worst Team Money Can Buy""?  If it is, I wouldn't give the book,
or anything in it any value whatsoever.  Klapisch wrote the
book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is
going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the
papers.  I'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof
that a Met player had raped a little girl before a game (let
alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not
Shea.
	For those people who do not know what the press is like
in New York, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about
any other part of the U.S.  Keith Hernandez said it very well on
ESPN a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a
clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a
game.  I do not read Klapisch's news columns regularly, but I
do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator
that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb
up a news story, even if there isn't one there.  Now as far as
the confrontation with Bobby Bonilla a few days ago, I almost
totally blame Bonilla.  No matter what a member of the press
does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might
be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a
journalist.  
	Personally, I always thought that a beat writer that
always follows a club around should report the news, but not be
looking to degrade a team.  I don't know whether to blame
Klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in New
York.

	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung
around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman
get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do

Organization: Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973

A lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster,
but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used.  He is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher
is injured during a game.     So to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not
invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:

If the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game, the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game.   

Given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster
catchers.  The 3rd catcher could be playing
in AAA or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.

  Alomar fans left RBI fans and Runs off this list because they are dependant
on the team. (To a large extent). If Frank Thomas hit first, he'd lose a LOT
of RBI's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
in 100 runs? Doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with Devon White's

I meant to comment on this at the time.

There's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,
runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  

Runs Created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and
there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent.

Williams B in CF.
  I also believe they kept Wickman and Millitello in their rotation, which is
much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their ""experience"". Granted, Witt
""might"" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has
experience.
  The Yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the

And thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along
with many others will never be separated. Almost *everything* in baseball is
situational and interdependent. This is what allows us to carry on all the
arguments that we have. If everything could be explained and balanced on a
statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. Why we might
have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.

Just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the

would have to rank up there. Luis Gonzalez and Derrick May are among
the early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the
Phils' expense. Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater
prowess in the past. 

How have the Rockies been early? I know Mile High has produced a ton of

Keywords: last chance for foolishness
Article-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 95

Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest.

AL East -- 1993

1.  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.
  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
  -- Milwaukee was a fluke
  -- Indians aren't ready to contend
  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better
  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""
""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter
of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-
body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn
Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:
STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.
WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3
  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.
ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing.

2. New York Yankees.
STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American
  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.
WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner 
  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to
  win a division.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.
ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.

3.  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.
  Guzman.  Alomar.
WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in
  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.
ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And
  have a losing record.

4.  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.
WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.
ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.

5.  Cleveland Indians
STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy
WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix
  Fermin.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.
ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.

6.  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens
WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre
  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how
  you will :->

7.  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker
WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
  This year could be *very* ugly.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.
ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.

One more division to go....

The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their
quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.
Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays, or at least been among the leaders.
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just
one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
 
Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great
on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.
 
Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers
some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.
I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw
seem to have come out of theirs.

George will do the only logical thing he can do when the Yanks' bullpen isn't

A little delayed, but in the interests of fairness (stats from Elias);
        BA    OBP   SLG  R  HR RBI RNI  %   outs
Alomar .310  .405  .427 105  8  76 264 20.5 419
Baerga .312  .354  .455  92 20 105 316 21.2 480

So we see that Baerga has a large advantage in RBI (runs batted in), RNI  
(runners not driven in) and outs.

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
yet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this
situation:

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.

However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early?  When the
ball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground?

Enlightenment would be appreciated.

Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,
with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.
My opinion, FWIW, to all:

Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays
better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent
minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las
Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have
the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.

That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to
start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league
season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very
poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill
are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,
they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around
.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on
the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at
any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

On a similar note, I don't understand why more people are not
supportive of Neon Deion. Granted, I thought his behavior with
McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time
he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he
has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more
valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),
had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,
EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF
(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching
his ""prime"" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate
prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--

Born 31 July 1962
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
1988    195    .282    .320    .328
1990    220    .277    .373    .321
1991    459    .264    .351    .317
1992    485    .249    .359    .290 

No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
a rosy picture.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was
a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.

I agree.

The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to

might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in New York
feel ""obligated"" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks.  610
WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia.  If I'm not
mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?

p.s the only nice thing about the FAN is that they talk sports all
night.  hopefully 610 will begin to do that somewhat soon

Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the
29 Philidelphia A's.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to
a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the
Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig
couldn't play every position simultaneously.

IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,
that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds
have slightly passed their peak.

Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.  
After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,
 both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team.

Are you for real?  How many Gold Gloves does Ozzie Smith have?  If a
guy hung around and hit 30 homers a year for 15 years, wouldn't he
be a given for the Hall?  Is defense not just as important?  And if
Robin Yount couldn't hit, why would he have stuck around long enough
to get 3,000 hits?  Are you saying 3,000 hits is a fluke?  3,000
hits is no big deal?

Well, based on your argument, Nolan Ryan doesn't deserve the Hall of
Fame.  He is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time
and could throw hard.  Very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of
losing seasons, lots of walks.  No Cy Young awards.  How does Nolan
Ryan compare to a guy like Steve Carlton who dominated 5 or 6 Major
League seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 World Series, and won half of his
teams games in 1972?  He doesn't compare.  Not even close.

Kirby Puckett hasn't done it long enough for me.  Give me 5 more
seasons like he's been having, then I'll think about it.

  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when
everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella.

  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.
Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they
play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.

  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard
plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. 
I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

briefly, since i'm off to sleep.

mle's work pretty well for AA nd AAA players.

players who are 22 and younger will tend to have explosions
 in their numbers, whether mMLE's or not, in the next 2 years...

players who are 26 and OLDER, at those levels, generally have
 inflated MLE's.

they're about as reliable as having major league stats for a player.

	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had
negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,
now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent
hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,
he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,
he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)
was a absolute-primo-dick.  
	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  
	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s
solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been 
a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.
	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like
Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.

>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,

	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?

>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.
>Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so
>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something

	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early
80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's
offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his
career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer
:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.
	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real
stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as
SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.

>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential 
>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a ""mediot"" 
candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one
at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of
a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.
	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris' ""ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned 
close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but
not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF
""consideration"".  
	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...
(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)
	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most
likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the
end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it 
or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably
left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these
are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]

Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)
Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)
Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)
Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)
New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)
Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)

Kansas City: George Brett (lock)
Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)
Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)
Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]

Cubs: Sandberg (lock)
St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)
New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain
				  	      past form)
[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]

Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.
San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)
Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)

	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include
Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,
McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985)]

	E-mail or post, I almost fear what I may have started here...

Only if you persist in believing that Peter Gammons is more knowledgable about
baseball than the average mailbox.  Okay, I'm overstating.  Still, the man 
actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the NL this
year did not pitch in the majors last year.

Huh?

IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.
In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some
increase will be seen.  He also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump
in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  He's still
full of it...

Why?  Do you expect him to remain the best shortstop in the game until
he reaches his seventy-third birthday, or something?  Why is it such a
strange concept that a forty-one-year-old Ozzie Smith might be a defensive
liability in 1996?

Something else to consider:

Alomar's H-R splits were .500-.363 SLG, .444-.369 OBP! Baerga's was .486-.424
and .392-.318. Pretty clearly, Alomar got a HUGE boost from his home park.

I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
rated Baerga higher, actually.

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although
Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is 
unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.

  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West.

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually
      starts the season very strong.

     On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey, with the word ""HOUSTON"" written across the
chest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...
     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  They
may not have been pretty, but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and I liked it.

Why?  Do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  He's 37.  
In a few years he'll be 40.  He doesn't get to as many grounders as
he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do
on every human so far.

Remember: Willie Mays was a defensive liability at he end of his

Summary: Root, root, root for the Orioles...

I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would
help so that the O's could make some real free agent signings in the 
offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent
although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming
up faster in the O's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike
Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This
may be Ben's year. 
	I feel that while this may not be Mussina's Cy Young year, he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the O's need.
Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in '91. The O's right now don't have many
left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cal's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The 
rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an
interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs? You never know.
The way I see the AL East this year (with personal biases mixed in)
Baltimore
New York
Toronto
Milwaukee
Cleveland
Boston
Detroit
(The top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. One of these 4 will
definitely win the division unless it snows in Hell/Maryland :). I feel
that this Baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)

Actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players

Uh, so?

You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players.
Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.
Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's
where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.

Thank you for making our case.  Have a nice day.

 Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and
beat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors,
a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with
a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you
could come up with any convincing argument the other way.
 People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know  
their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that
Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,
Alomar was drawing walks and being on base for Carter, Winfield et.al.

Mel is alive and well and playing in Japan. (The Yanks let him go because

Buck Showalter just can't win. 

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks
lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,
and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.
So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.

Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks
lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, ""I don't want a repeat of that
near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work."" Steve Howe,
whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't
do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the
Royals win it, 6-5.

What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,
Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the
deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our
bullpen turns to shit!

What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?

So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) Zane Smith should learn how to ""switchpitch"" and return from the DL. I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.

5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.

6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.

8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.

9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.

11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.

14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.

On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>

I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,
notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.

Actually, Gaetti's first year with California was 1991.  His .632 DA wasn't
out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average
in 1988.  But check out the last three years at the Metrodome.

1990
Gaetti  .655
AL Avg  .604
1991
Pags    .744
Leius   .653
Al Avg  .620
1992
Leius   .680
AL Avg  .603

For the last three years, the highest DAs in either league have been posted
by Minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (Pags) who was
mediocre to horrible elsewhere.  That doesn't *prove* a park effect is at
work, any more than San Diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect
is at work.  But it looks like a strong possibility to me.

Pags and Terry Jorgenson will platoon at third, with Reboulet as the
backup infielder.  Pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who
lead the league in DA in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders
(heck, muffing a grounder *I* would probably have gotten to).  Jorgenson
did nothing exceptional that I noticed.  Leius missed a ball I *think*
Gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss Gag's glove this season.

He looked pretty good there.  Contrary to what the mediots have been saying,
he looked reasonable at first.  He isn't mid-80s Hrbek, but then neither is
the Pretty Big Guy himself any more (note:  I'm used to seeing the Twins
1B looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  If he hits vaguely
like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.

Note:  Much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game
where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  Winfield may
have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to
pick any bad throws, for example), but I'll take what I saw so far.

Beware.  The original poster looks to be from Louisville, and chances are  
Louisville gets the edition of the NYTimes that is printed in Chicago for the

Well, with players, certainly.  However, it is quite possible to win
it all with no managerial talent.  Cf. Blue Jays, 1992.

A month?  Well, he did have a short career--compared to what one might
have expected for such a highly touted prospect--due to being injury prone,
overweight, and having no work ethic.  But he certainly did not
suffer from being rushed to the bigs.

     Hi, baseball fans! So what do you say? Don't you think he deserves it?

mean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it,
as

is Lee Smith (ha), then why don't we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell

Eddie

Murray and Jeff Reardon.

     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving

Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,
marginal.

Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.

     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors
so

liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if
something

isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When

certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential

candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to

the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  Unusual

Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.
Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting
him.

As far as the Whitten/Gilkey controversy.  Whitten adds some more
needed power, and if Jordan continues to hit the way he has been,
Gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open
stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.

Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.

The A's also objected about this.

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled
'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  How do
they determine that?  Beats me -- it's been a long, long time since I
read it.

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the
split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%.

Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0.
Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get
ready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to
the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural 
power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy
which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should
get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.

In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating the
Dodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wish
them and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would be
funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.

Subject: RBI, RISP, and SLG
Organization: Bill's Safety Cab and Record Bar, Chickasha, OK
Lines: 49

Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)
that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This 
completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 
could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.

I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that
I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and
b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.
That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't 
have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is
significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the
fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,
Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.

It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie.  The results:

                           RBI-HR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6
Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6
Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8
Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6

I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

More later,
Harold

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.
My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.
There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most 
runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.

Probably because everyone (that is, everyone who has cable) can watch
every Braves game. They are the only team that has all of its games
broadcast nationwide. And if you don't like your local team, or you don't
have a local team, the Braves can kind of become your local team because
you can watch them every day.

As long as the Yankees are in the same division the Red Sox will
play better than .500 baseball.

Or the Red Sox can hire former East German swimming coaches to
""train"" them at the fine art of body ""building"". The Red Sox
can use Chinese women swimmers as a reference.

With the ""HAWK"", the Red Sox definitely have a chance for the

Let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.
As I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under
Roger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
out.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.
I am not a big fan of Manwaring.

I read this morning that Sid Fernandez left last nights' game with stiffness
in his shoulder. Does anyone have any information as to the extent of the
injury (if indeed there is one), or weather the cold air in Colorado just got
his joints a little stiff?

Thanks for the help...

Wetteland comes off the DL on April 23rd, and will be evaluated on the 24th.
He is throwing well, and without pain on the side.

DeShields is not on the DL.  He suffered from the chicken pox and lost
(this is the official total) 12 pounds.  He will be back, hopefully,
next week.

Walker will be back this tonight or tomorrow...

The New York talk shows are just awful in this regard.  People are constantly
calling WFAN and WABC with (stuff like) ""I was thinking, why don't the Yankees
trade Kaminicki and Silvestri to Seattle for Ken Griffey Jr and Randy Johnson,
that would really help the team""  or ""Do you think the Yankees can get Roger 
Clemens?"".  The show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's
still annoying.

The best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with ""I was 
thinking, why don't the Yankees trade for..."" and then the host hung up on
him.  I cheered!

    My guess is Jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low

    and great defense in rightfield.  But don't worry, Gilkey will be
starting

Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players.  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.

On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players
of all time.

And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.

We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably
aren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.

Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't
belong near Cooperstown.

 Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer)

To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

Robin Yount 43.0 (41)
Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45)
Dave Winfield 40.3 (53)
Eddie Murray 37.5 (68)
Darrel Evans 35.2 (80)
Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180)
Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219)
Jack Morris 11.8 (478)
Dave Kingman 0.4 
Steve Garvey -5.8

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:
Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall
of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby
Grich, and Bob Johnson.

Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of
those eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in.

This is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. Selig needs to do
is to suspend Bobby Cox.  You *cannot* allow a team to come out at
the ump as the Braves did.  I usually rip umps, but in this case,
the players were dead wrong.  Cox should go for 5 games.  If I
had ever umped a game where that happened, I'd have ejected every
player that came out.  Only Cox and Gant would have been spared, and
then Cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.

Both protests would be denied, of course.  The umpire's judgement
determines the garbage thing, although I think the game should be
called (but that's my personal opinion...doesn't matter).  There
is time only when the ump says, so the second argument is baseless.

Someone in SABR actually looked at these games a few years ago 
and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one 
of the games - even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly 
(allowing 4 or 5 runs).

  The event that had the most impact on Gaetti's career was his leg injury
in 1988.  His performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989.  He was 
still with the Twins in 1989 and 1990, but if you look at his stats (both
offensive and defensive), he never has come back to his pre-injury level.

Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is
a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom
of the 13th.  Who won the game?

-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.
-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him to do so.
-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and
 got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of
 the inning.

Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for
the win.

How about the offense?
-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either
 one, the Sox would have lost in nine.
-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.
-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first
 to third when...
-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.
-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of
 a help, but it was something.
-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the
 way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)

Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were
credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit
that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as
much as Richardson?

Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than
runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the
game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out!

Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You
can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the
clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't
*claim* to try to tell you that.

Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.
All 20 of them!

Does anyone know where Billy Taylor is?  Richmond or Syracuse?  He was taken
by the Jays in the Rule V draft, but not kept on the roster.  Baseball Weekly
said that he was demoted to Syracuse, but a Toronto paper indicated that
the Braves took him back.  Is there an Atlanta fan, or anyone reading this,
who knows?   

Thanks

Despite walks and loses, Ryan deserves to be in the Hall of Fame (IMHO)
based only on his ho-hitters.  The strike-out records are an extra.

What do people think about Andre ""400 HR"" Dawson for the HOF?

Depends on what you mean by ""for a living"".  1974 was the year he led the
league in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of PH ABs
earlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 PH ABs early in
his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the Dodgers, and 30-50 in the
peak years.

We're talking about a guy with a 20-year career as an outfielder, a .300+
career batting average, and 1130 or so career hits.

Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our

I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet

Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.

As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good
season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.

The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down ""until he gets warmed up"".

>OK.  Most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 

Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do
with Javy Lopez?

See above.

But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most

either.

And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.

Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're
being charitable.

>The Braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the

>at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  

Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year
in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a
big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.


>The center

Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.

>The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, 

Just like Keith Mitchell did?

>I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.  My

That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last. 
The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).
The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).
The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a `good thing'

This may be an appropriate comparison.
The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 
18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. 
In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
7, 7 and 3 games out).
Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season.
(on the other hand... I'm still picking the Braves to go all the way)

Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off
if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame!

1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though
Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still
recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.

I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez
can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was
the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was
the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson
and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box, and don't walk enough to be useful.

But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went
with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.

2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.
After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher
(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to
move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.
Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't
tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill
at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).

3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to
play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players
aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,
but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business
standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the
first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.

4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.
I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,
and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,
which, IMO, includes Lopez.

Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)

As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went
like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)
(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)

Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a
little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding
is better than it used to be.

Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion
just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count
on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the
defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on
Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,
we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995.

Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.
OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having
Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about
Klesko?

Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil
for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money
or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,
but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First
Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he
gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he
and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!

Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading
deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few
extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...
if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.
And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees
could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  There's always the
15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?

Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts
in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be
arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.

Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.

Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson
would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into
running into him again?

Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get
$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one
extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little
bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed
hitter.  You know how rare that is?

Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,
if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in
the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!

Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez
into the lineup.

Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff
Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used
to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with
them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?

Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep
will be hurt by May.

Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely
one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I
can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!
THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey
Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,
but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally
get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those
""happy pills"" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you
ever hire that guy anyhow?

Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.

I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is
generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.
Am I wrong?

And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank
you.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.
Easley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up.
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.

Personally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a 
winning team.

Up to this point, I really thought this had been written by a 
pro-SDCN, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
sarcasm and biting remarks.  Somebody like me, for instance.
The lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
original poster.

But then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  Looks like Robert is
really being serious.  Oh, well.

I compare the performance of the 1992 Phillies with the 1987 edition,
which had outstanding run producers at every position except SS, yet
finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  The 1987 folks didn't 
ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, IMHO.

Any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
editions (in the style of 1993 Braves = 1971 Orioles)?

Summary: Earl Weaver Commandments

	The Orioles' pitching staff again is having a fine exhibition season.
Four shutouts, low team ERA, (Well, I haven't gotten any baseball news since
March 14 but anyways) Could they contend, yes. Could they win it all?  Maybe.

But for all those fans of teams with bad spring records, remember Earl
Weaver's first law of baseball (From his book on managing)

No one gives a damn in July if you lost a game in March. :)

BTW, anyone have any idea on the contenders for the O's fifth starter?
It's pretty much set that Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald and Rhodes are the
first four in the rotation.

Here at Johns Hopkins University where the mascot is the Blue Jay :(,
their baseball team logo was the Toronto club's logo. Now it's a 
anatomically correct blue jay. God, can't they think of an original idea?
It's even in the same pose as the baltimore oriole on the O's hats.
How many people realize that the bird is really called a baltimore oriole?

Organization: University of Denver, Dept. of Math & Comp. Sci.
Lines: 74

I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?

First Base:

Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,
then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs

Second Base:

Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge
to Cubs...a big edge.

Shortstop:

Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an
automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.

Third Base:

Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to
Florida.

Catcher: 

Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to
Marlins

Left Field:

Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves
himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position
where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.

Center:

Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May
isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time.

Right:

Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does
Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs

Starters:

Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't
remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard
is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief:

Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.
Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.

Closer:

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but
no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.
Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with
a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Overall, an edge to Chicago.
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt's home run against the
Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high
48th. 

Another home run that I thought was totally incredible was in the
1986 ALCS.  The CA Angles had the Boston Red Sox *1* strike away from
the pennant until Don Baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
That was the most incredible turn of events I have EVER seen in
baseball.  The Sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the WS against the Mets.  Speaking of the METS,
isn't it strange how the NLCS that year with the Astros ALMOST
mirrored the 1980 NLCS with the Phillies??  The Astros have been
painfully close twice I must admit.

Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him.

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know
I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)

Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.

FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)
   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65
   = just over $1,000,000.

Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.

FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65
   = almost 2,000,000.

(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t 
think I'm off by much.

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-
time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results
I would love to see that.

Subject: Torre: The worst manager?
Organization: Georgia Institute of Technology
Lines: 31

Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home, 

I can't take this anymore

Did anyone notice the words ""NOT FOR BASEBALL"" printed on the picture
of Joe Robbie Stadium in the Opening Day season preview section in USA
Today? Any reason given for this?

Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.
On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan
pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are
both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing
and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.

Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA

Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.
 
Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.
In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then
a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the
throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.
 
Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza
batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder
and Webster.
 
Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.
The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by Offerman.
 
By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but
the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive
plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner
trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base, etc.
 
Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into
the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw
to third and EASILY got the runner at third.
 
My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.
 
Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game
with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.
 
Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3
innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning
game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh
given his light work out Tuesday.
 
Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit
to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted
in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next
thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had
scored long before that.
 
Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.
Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros
and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).
Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but
that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his
third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my
free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this
up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year.
 
The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.
Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM
gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but 
doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team
more than A and C?  Think hard, now.

>history?  225 hits in 1930, consistantly over .300.  A great, great second baseman.

Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in his
nine years in the majors.

As for his ""consistently over .300,"" make that ""three years in a row, 
preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston.""  Hodapp
only qualified for the batting title five times.  

Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.

Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up
flashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; 
his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
to draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, which
does not describe a feared hitter.  

On the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous Cleveland 2B:
Wambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.

     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux
did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight
fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the
first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,
when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally
walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.

     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning
about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he
has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.

     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba
has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher
from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With
Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed
reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that
Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.
I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it.

I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because, 
after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.

I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the
AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.

>Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on the

I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her
either.

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the
players from trying to kill each other. 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most
of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires
need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember 
a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length 
is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.

Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.

>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don't belong there. They're both

>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.

Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.

>     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors
>so

>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if

Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you're running down.

>something
>isn't done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When

That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.

>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.

There's a strong possibility that the Bucs have absolutely no other catching  
prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious  
AAA/majors duty.  The main reason they might have stayed with Prince could be  
just age, especially if Spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.
 
All things considered, though, I'd be a lot more comfortable with Spanky behind  
the plate than Prince.  Isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  
for work?

Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the
pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player
is on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
game than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their
part of the offense, but that's another issue.)

That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  They
hit pretty well in addition to their defense.

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?

No, currently there's no room for him in the rotation.  Key is having
a Most Impressive April.  Abbott is pitching well.  Perez is back.
Wickman has pitched his way into the rotation, and is holding his spot
with an outstanding performance his last time out.  And Kamieniecki
isn't doing too poorly himself.

If the Yankees find themselves in need of a starter, Militello will
get another chance.  Until then, he'll have to wait in line.

There is NO TEAM, repeat, NO TEAM, that is America's team.  This is a diverse
country with 26 MLB teams (+2 up north) and there is no one team that is
America's.  Who would the other teams belong to?

And how does it happen?  Well, teams receive this monicker through success
(Cowboys), national exposure (Cubs), or both (Braves).  It spreas aby
successful advertising campaigns.  Harry Caray, Ted Turner, amd other dupe
people into thinking that their representative teams are ""hip"" so that people
will watch them on TV and buy their products.  Arrogant local fans adapt the

	The term ""stopper"" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one
who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going
on a losing streak.

	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,
although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.

	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.
There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure
hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster
has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.	

	Oh, and another thing that worries me.  Ron Gant seems to have
slowed down a step.  That's scary.  A slow Ron Gant doesn't have much going
for him.

Lou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $40 million

I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had
73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.

Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than
the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year
at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so
far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they
shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3
blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.

*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.
But I think third or fourth place is more likely.

It depends.  If you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform

develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.
If the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.

Not really, though I wouldn't personally say ""the most deserving

I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of
the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think
they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This
year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.
Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.

And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their
offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.
(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR
potential.)

I saw the replay several times too.  No question about it.  Daryl missed
the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  Daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball.  Daryl's just whining again.  I think it shows a
lack of class when Tommy, Daryl and the Dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game.  What about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
What about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  Sorry, Tommy.
If it were a 2-1 game and Daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -
just maybe - you'd have an argument.

I like Alomar.  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about ""a city
which is likely to pour in the votes..."".

I attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a
great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left
them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets
no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.

Unfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games
during the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The
apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.

No argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year.  On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into
an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at
least at some point).  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess
that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years

I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the

Well, we'll see.  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the ""Astros stripes""
across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i
can see why they might want that to change.  Gee, if they eliminate the

the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of
position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the
game.

The Phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday against the Padres.

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought
it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY
looking at it first.  What tripe.

The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James
claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre
statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he
probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
on it. 

To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.

	The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend.  The '69 Mets and '89 Orioles are prime examples,
not the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but 
basically they are dogs.  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog.
If the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  The North Stars
trip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey. 
The Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much
less than America's Team.

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much
as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the
field.

Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.

I'm pretty sure that Sandberg has done this at least once.  (I know someone

RBIs and Runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics.  You

Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine
fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't
reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!

This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.

Cheers,

	The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,
he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at
all.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scored
a run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,
thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.

How many runs will be scored in Denver?
I don't know.

but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in 
Mile High Stadium during the last few years of the Bears/Zephyrs 
tenure in the American Association.

Here's the total runs scored per game in Zephyrs games, 
all league games and the ratio. I found the same ratios for HR.

Year  rpg   lea  ratio  hrpg lea ratio   
1992 10.22  9.10 1.12   1.65 1.58 1.04
1991  9.53  8.87 1.07   1.41 1.26 1.12
1990 10.71  8.72 1.23   1.49 1.24 1.20
1989  9.07  8.34 1.09   1.27 1.11 1.14
1988  9.90  8.37 1.18   1.29 1.08 1.19
1987 12.55 10.70 1.17   2.39 1.92 1.24
1986  9.45  9.33 1.01   1.35 1.38  .98
1985  9.50  8.54 1.11   1.53 1.34 1.14
1984  9.99  9.10 1.10   1.55 1.59  .97
1983 10.60  9.99 1.06   2.03 1.74 1.17
1982 11.29 10.35 1.09   2.24 1.91 1.17
1981 10.29  9.25 1.11   1.43 1.49  .96
1980 10.59  9.43 1.12   1.63 1.46 1.12
      1446/13-->1.11     1444/13-->1.11

It seems pretty clear that Denver will have a large effect 
on runs scored (I'll stick with my prediction from last year 
that it'll be one of the top 3 in the NL this year) 
and a fairly large effect on Homeruns - though apparently not as large as 
Atlanta, Wrigley, Cincinnati and San Diego.
Still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.

I would e-mail this to you, but my mailserver doesn't recognize you or
something.

Anyway, the worst pitcher on the Yanks. If you mean currently on the team,
then I have to go with Scott ""I'm a schizophrenic...No, I'm NOT!""
Kamienicki. Sure, occasionally the guy can pitch well for 5 or 6 innings,
but then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he's losing his stuff
(and his mind) is when he starts to stalk around the mound between batters
and yell at himself.

The worst all-time Yanks pitcher?  Gotta go with Ed ""New York? I have to
pitch in [gulp] New York?"" Whitson. 'Nuff said!

As a Philly fan as as a Penna. baseball fan, I'm anxious to see the

This is (I think) always good baseball (to me); and the Pirates are
also off to a good start.

Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his. And ""six or seven home runs""? Hmm.

So, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take 
Alomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.

The tribe will be in town from April 16 to the 19th.
There are ALWAYS tickets available! (Though they are playing Toronto,
and many Toronto fans make the trip to Cleveland as it is easier to
get tickets in Cleveland than in Toronto.  Either way, I seriously
doubt they will sell out until the end of the season.)

Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate 
and also for Baseball America.

Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was ""projected"" 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

Stark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good 
collections of strange things that happened during the previous week. He 
also regularly prints Kinerisms.

     But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.
Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and
an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract.)
     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in
1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season.

     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the
2nd half of last year.  
     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds
up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have
his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.

>His $5 million contract is an awful lot to eat!

     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like
a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.
Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)
     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.
He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.

Didn't Mike Schmidt also do this at least three times?  I can

Kong did it in a 23-22 shootout, and he swatted four there one
day in April '76 (the month he set the April record with 11 HR's.

I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result
in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%
does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in
each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning
by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,
before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is.

The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a
player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases.
Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,
they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,
the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that
pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.

No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would
think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The
offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If
I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.

No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,
if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,
fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team
would win.
 
From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really
does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except
for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to
player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for
instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.
I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.

How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the
exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,
etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched
in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more
valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better 
pitcher?  They were probably about the same.

I tell you, Steve Stone is like a prophet.
He must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because
I can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself.

The other day he called Sosa's homerun against the Sox and
claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
score was 8-3 in the 5th.

So yesterday he notices that Sosa's ahead in the count against
Maddux and says, ""This is a fastball situation and Sosa will be
looking for it.  But this is also the spot where Maddux throws
the straight change.""   Sure enough. Sosa gets ahead on it and pops
it up to the infield.

Stoney for Cubs manager!

See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.





>Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)

Let's see... April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he 
hasn't done too much so far!

Cut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. It's scary to think
just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good
bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank
Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far. 

If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This 
is the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since ""78!

>>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?

I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
up near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even
if you count the expansion teams.

The Red Sox usually have 2 catchers.  I don't think they have a backup now,
but they used to use Randy Kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder.  You don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.

>I'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. T&P
>rated Baerga higher, actually.

Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

>Is it just me, or does Bichette look totally lost in the outfield?

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)

Also, if you have a home schedule available - can you tell me the dates
for all home games between July26-Aug6 and between Aug30-Sept10 and if
any of these games are promotion nights or special discount nights?

Thanks !!!  Ron

Sorry Len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.
Being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with
nothing to loose, might have been corrected in Richmond.  (Did you intend a 
smiley after your comment?)

This brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop Braves fans who
kept being promised the Bob Horner - Dale Murphy back to back power slam.  Who
could stop that?  Guess we'll never know.

P.S. - Rocky fans (are there any yet?)  Is Dale getting any playing time out
there?  I plan to be at the game on June 28th, they'll have to play him then.
