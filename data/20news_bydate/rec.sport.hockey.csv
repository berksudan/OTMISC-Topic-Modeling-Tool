I am sure some bashers of Pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent Pens massacre of the Devils. Actually,
I am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. However, I am going to put an end
to non-PIttsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the Pens. Man, they
are killing those Devils worse than I thought. Jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. He is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs. Bowman should let JAgr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the Pens are going to beat the pulp out of Jersey anyway. I was very disappointed not to see the Islanders lose the final
regular season game.          PENS RULE!!!

[stuff deleted]

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able
to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT at 1:00 on ABC, LA-CAL at 3:00 (CBC), 
BUFF-BOS at 7:00 (TSN and FOX), and MON-QUE at 7:30 (CBC).  I think that if
each series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
consecutive nights (I haven't counted so that's a pure guess).

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE
and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two
afternoon games.

Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed
to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job.  They were quite impartial also, IMO.

Yeah, it's the second one.  And I believe that price too.  I've been trying
to get a good look at it on the Bruin-Sabre telecasts, and wow! does it ever
look good.  Whoever did that paint job knew what they were doing.  And given
Fuhr's play since he got it, I bet the Bruins are wishing he didn't have it:)

I don't know the exact coverage in the states.  In Canada it is covered
by TSN, so maybe ESPN will grab their coverage!  I don't know!

As for the picks
Ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that Alexander Daigle will 
go #1. He'll either stay or be traded in Montreal or Quebec.  IMO I would
take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in
the World Championships.  Daigle didn't show this for his junior team.

San Jose will then get Kariya.

Tampa Bay will either go for a russian Kozlov (I think that's it) or a 
    defenseman Rob Niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

Because of expansion I won't go further but I will name other of the
blue chip prospects

   - Chris Gratton
   - Chris Pridham
   - a swedish player who I can't remember his name

Draft Order
-----------
1) Ottawa
2) San Jose
3) Tampa Bay
4) South Florida or Anahiem
5) South Florida or Anahiem
6) Hartford
7) Edmonton
8) Dallas
9) NY Rangers
10) Philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - I don't have the standings here
and am guessing 

(In my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with Kariya 
 leading the way but not going #1)

Shawn - GO CAPS (two first round picks for the next three years - THANKS
                 ST.LOUIS or should I say RON CARON and SCOTT STEVENS)

Well, Dave, I would have to disagree with you there.  Satan himself could
own the team, and I'd be happy as long as the Oilers stayed in Edmonton.
Selfish, but true.  I don't want to see the Oilers move, no matter who
their owner is.

Why not? I believe both the Devils and Islanders got 87 points.
Say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47;
they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total.
(The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.

It is simple arithmetics and involve no Calculus.

  Well I think whenever ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job. But
   what I don't understand is that they cut the OT just show some stupid
   baseball news which is not important at all. Then I waited for the scores
   to comeon Sportscenter, but they talk about Baseball, basketball and 
   football. Then they showed Penguine highlight and went back to stupid
   basketball. Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that
   was like 30 sec. I think they should give more attention to NHl during
   the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..

   I guess it is NHL's fault too for leaving ESPN. Hope things improve
   by next season...

Hey man! -

Having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a
couple of sessions of mock hockey, I'm ready to invest in hockey
equipment (particularly since I will be taking summer 'hockey
lessons').  However, I am completely and profoundly ignorant when it
comes to hockey equipment.  I've checked out local stores and looked
at catalogs, but I was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before
actually plunking down any money.  Having played football in high
school and college I at least have that equipment as a basis for
comparison.  But for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to
different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  Are there any
notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  So any suggestions
or comments would be greatly appreciated.

Hey, it's better than nothing!

How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they 
lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for
the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

Not necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely

That only makes common sense, since they didn't lose many games.

Unfortunately, you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to

Let's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it. (like I'm doing now,
excuse me!)

  Listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs.  I'm here in a
small town in southern Illinois at school.  I'm from Canada and I know
that cbc and tsn have games on every night,  all you have to do is go to
a bar with a satellite.  I have watched both games between Mon Que and
toronto and detroit,  not to mention Van vs Winn and with cbc.  They
show all goals from every game that evening so I haven't missed a goal
all playoffs.  Well have to go boy leafs are on Ciao.

Obviously some reporter for the Ottawa Sun got taken by an April
Fools joke...probably started by someone with the Nordiques or the
Bruins.  

Like for example...who is going to reimburse the Flyers for the
$15 million they paid to the Nordiques...like the Senators are
going to get Lindros and $15 million.  The Flyers sent the
equivalent of 6 or 7 players (when you include the draft choices)
to Quebec, and they are going to get only four back.

Some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a

     Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about
him, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was
that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay
by comparison.  Read the book ""Net Worth"" for one view of what Smythe
(and Norris and Adams and Campbell) were like.

     Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I said
it previously too) is that these are NOT the people who made the
league great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after
them instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DID
make it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who
got rich off of the men who made the game great.

It may have been passed to Toronto, but I've even seen an octopus at

	I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although
they were not great players themselves.  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize
what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.  
 
>The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.  All of the aforemen-

	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say
that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy
individual (from what I have heard). 

	Also, isn't the point of ""professional"" hockey to make money
for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

The rumour was basically everywhere in Toronto based on reports
that Keenan has told both San Jose and Philadelphia that he
was no longer interested in pursuing further negotiations with
either team. 

The Ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly.

The Rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coach

Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who
live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the
city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals
play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The
Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in
North America.
As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a
franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown
County Arena.
Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of
Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen
crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e.
the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.
Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without
the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount
of hockey interest exists in the city.

Sincerely,

Martin Hill, Rt. 2, Box 155B, Sault Ste. Marie, MI (Home of LSSU:  Go Lakers!)

P.S.  Anybody know what the attendance figures are for the IHL and how
Milwaukee stacks up against other IHL cities such as Atlanta, Phoenix, San
Diego, Cleveland, and Cincinnati?  If so, please reply.

Soderstrom plays with Philly, but he doesn't have a moulded mask.
He's got the helmet and cage variety, in white.  Or at least that's

That was Clint Malarchuk.  That was a very dangerous accident.  He could he
died right there on the ice.  However, he has played since  
but I don't know where he is now.  I think he is still playing but I'm
not positive.  He was a Sabre at the time.
I don't know who skated into him though.

Bowman tended to overplay Francis at times because he is a Bowman-style
player.  He plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader.  Bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time.

Jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a ""me first"" attitude.
This rubbed Bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.

Throughout the year, Francis consistently recieved more ice time than
Jagr.  Althouhg I have never seen stats on this subject, I am pretty
sure that Jagr had more points per minute played that Francis.  When
you add to that Jagr's better +/- rating, I think it becomes evident
that Jagr had a better season- not that Francis had a bad one.

How about Kevin Hatcher? Scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.

That's really sad when two second-rate goalies (Barasso and Belfour)
are the main contenders for the Vezina. Call me crazy, but how about
Tommy Soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't
really play defense. It's really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league (McLean, Essensa, Vernon) had unspectacular years. BTW,
if you are going to award the Norris on the basis of the last 30 days,
why not give the Vezina to Moog? He has been the best goalie over the
past month.

Arbour or King. Burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken
into consideration - he's OK in the regular season, but I'm not sure
if he's beaten anyone other than Hartford in the playoffs.

Yes and No. ESPN2 will be launched as early in September. Cap Cities
are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up
base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.

The problem ESPN2 faces is the TCI-Cablevision connection in the
merger of their Prime and SportsChannel networks. Prime SportsChannel
will try to wrestle away NHL from ESPN in the off-season. Also,TCI
and Cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers. TCI-Cablevision will
do their best that ESPN2 never gets off the ground successfully. And the
NHL's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between Prime SC
and ESPN. NHL is more vital to the survival of a regionalized Prime
SportsChannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local NHL/NBA/MLB sports teams.

I was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive

fairly conclusively that the puck did _not_ cross the goal line at any

I have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  I don't like to see stickwork,
but you have to clear players away from in front.  My personal favorite move
(I'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  Makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (I'm 
talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  It also makes the 
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty.  Unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 
position for a short time...I don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side.  Hmm....maybe I should mail Potvin this method (in French and with
helpful diagrams, of course).  It sure would be nice to see Ciccerelli (who
I have a great deal of respect for, BTW, he's not a big guy, but he plays
huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)

Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on ""normal"" hockey
revenues and expenses.  That he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or
via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

on left wing with Eric Lindros and Mark Recchi at the world
championships.

    I have some advice for you, and some thoughts about
your hatred of the Minnesota North Stars:

1. A real team like Toronto would not be moved, you are right,
   just eliminated from the playoffs first round!
2. Why stay in Minnesota when you can go to a college in
   Western Ontario and actually take classes on map-reading
   and the Artistry of BSing specifically set up for just you.
3. Why should anyone love the Stars, when hating the Leafs
   is so much better?
4. Oh, I'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my
   big words.. next time I'll limit my vocabulary to words
   like ""get real team now"" and ""do not waste our time""
5. Respond to this article. I love to laugh at your humor,
   even though it it unintentional. I got a BIG kick out of

I didn't mean to imply that Gund's offer wasn't enough.  Gund's offer
was the right $, but too late in the season.  $2M offered in November
lets Sather buy a replacement for Murphy *this* season and make the
playoffs *this* year. $2M in March doesn't help Sather with his
immediate objectives, doesn't help with long term objectives (only a
prospect or draft pick does, and no way should the Sharks do that).
However, getting back to what-if games, had Kisio been traded to
Chicago last year, then the Sharks go 0 for October, and maybe Gund
panicks sooner in November. And here's another what-if twist: Chicago
would have had Kisio this season; they *never* go after Murphy in the
first place because Kelly is having his *best* season (bigger guys in
Chicago). So Gund has no competition. So Ferriera, Sather, and Keenan
all look like geniuses.

A broken fax machine, and Ferriera, Keenan, and maybe Kingston
(and maybe even Green) lose their jobs. Kind of makes you
shiver doesn't it. :-)

Bottomline, for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
Kisio leaving, I can concoct an equally bright one.

I've been a loyal ticket holder, since day 1 (literally) in spring of
'90 when the team was announced.  and I'm not getting that loyalty

Pocklington with his cheap tix is the best owner of all.

What sadist brought up this vein about Malarchuk?  When I saw what
happened I wanted to throw up, and at the same time I was devastated,
since I thought that Malarchuk wouldn't survive.  BTW, I believe he picked
up an alcohol problem after (before?) the incident.

To radically change the subject, the Caps must be having nightmares about
the Isles in overtime in the playoffs.  Have they *ever* beaten the
Islanders in a playoff OT game?  This is lunacy.  The Caps are such a
sorry team in the playoffs, they consistently choke against opponents who
they should be beating.  Losing two OT games in a row is not coincidence,
it's evidence of the choke factor.

One reason that the WHA abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it
crumbled very quickly during play.  The blue dye that was used somehow
affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck, decreasing its cohesiveness.

I agree that Keenan is an excellent choice.  Did you see Mike

I'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
quiet (you know, doing the ""lurking"" thing).  I don't have a
sense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I 
am a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the
Garden throughout the Penguins' - led by Mario's 5 goals - decimation 
of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this

Hurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I'm not sure, but I

I believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation 
factor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for 
that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any REAL physical intimidation (I'd like to have a nickel 
for every time J.D. said 'They've got to take the body more'), 
you've got to at least have some illusions ;-(

I agree and I don't know.

Sorry, I don't agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good
job filling in when he was asked to.  I can't imagine that it's
easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don't
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at
least didn't make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an
interview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.

Absolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the

Islanders.

The man is awesome.  In a way, I'm enjoying the playoffs more,
now that the Rangers aren't in them.  I can really appreciate
all the glory Mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's
on the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I'm
concerned.

Yes, he does.  BUT, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  When
I played roller hockey (boy do I miss those days) as a goalie, I would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  I don't care if he's
in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so I can see the ball!
(Yes, roller hockey, remember)  And if there was nobody around to clear
the slot, then I'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. 
I *hate* people in my way when I'm the goalie, and I am sure Felix does
too.  I should say that I didn't see the incident, so if Potvin really
swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people
out of the way.  He's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)

Golly, I love stupid people. :-)
Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,
there exist these things called ""ties"".  A tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. 
There also exits these things called ""wins"".  A win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other
at a time, so I can say ""the opponent"".)  A team gets two points for a
win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10
ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The
first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86
points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number
of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,
Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then
that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the ""better"" record, even though both teams
had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,
maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.

Absolute nonsense.  The decision that was made was Pocklington's.  He chose 
20 mill over Gretzky.  If Gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win
a cup in LA then I submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.

How do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  The only ""thought"" that I

Big deal.

The real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  What
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref won't be fooled.  I can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
Lemieux to change his game.  Why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated
type like Hull and Salami.

I think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 
Conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional 
names.  Although I still do not think the move will draw fans to the
game; IMO it's a cosmetic change that Bettman and the owners _hope_ 
will have an effect.  And it doesn't say much for the mentality of 
anybody it works on, either.

Surprise, I agree totally.  The points system is fine, if everybody at all
times has played the same number of games.  Since this is almost never the
case, winning percentage is the way to go.  I don't particularly care if it 
is an ""American"" thing either, if it works.

Oh to be back in the good old days when I lived in Florida (Florida for
Petes sake!!) and could watch hockey every night as ESPN and USA alternated
coverage nights. Oh well I guess it would be too simple for the home office
to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present...

Of course I shouldn't complain. At least I'm getting to watch the playoffs
for a change. (Hooray!!) Now if the ESPN schedulers will realise there are
other teams except Pittsberg in the Patrick. (Sounds like a Dr Suess Book

OK. I know I look pretty desperate on this bboard. I think I have posted
3 or 4 messages already on the issue of NHL telecats over the last few weeks.
But, hey. I am pretty desperate. What I am interested is not just a
sportsbar with multiple screens so thast I can watch the game on one
of those silent screens. Are there any hockey oriented bars in this area.
Or does some Patrick division or Adams division fan have a satellite dish?
I don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.

It was great to hear that UMass is bringing back hockey!  It reminded me that a
couple of years ago there was talk that both Bimidgi (sp?) and Mankato State
trying to upgrade their programs to Div. 1 status.  I also seem to remember
that they had some trouble with new NCAA rule about just who was allowed to
compete at the Div. 1 level.  Was that ever resolved?  Also, I was just
wondering if there is ANY college hockey east of Colorado (Alaska excepted).
With the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, I would expect there to
be some interest building at the collegiate levels too. Anyone heard anything?

Obviously, it is ultimately the teams choice...the NHL would obviously
prefer not to annoy the European hockey federations, but the NHL right
now cannot force NHL teams to free their players...the Whalers probably
did it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate.

I don't ""notice"" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and
yes I have to agree that Stewart called the *two* worst games I've seen
so far (Mtl-Quebec game 1, and last nights Toronto-Detroit game).

What's the scoop on this guy? Is he the latest incarnation of
KERRY FRASER??? Just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesn't
make you a good ref!!! Making the right call does...

Best Ref: Van Hellemond

Hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and
Pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals.  If they make it again, 
they will probably keep the Cup.  If they don't, it's the Hawks' turn!

Fedorov, Primeau, Kozlov, Lidstrom, Sillinger, Konstantinov, Drake,

Devellano...Murray inherited these guys...in addition to Yzerman,
Probert, Carson, Chiasson, etc.

No...Quinn had far less...Murray took over Detroit at a time to

Subject: Too Many Europeans in NHL
Organization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 50



   Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:

Canadians: 400
Americans: 100
Europeans: 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.

   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the
Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and
""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,
and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well. 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the
Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with ;-). 

    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and
some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,
but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

    I just don't want them on mine.

So this year you had a game on SCNY, a game on SCA, a game on ESPN,
and if the Rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a
game on MSG.  What are you complaining about?

I seem to recall last year everyone complaining about SC coverage.  I
even remember Orioles' games being shown in the DC area instead of
hockey.  And what about when SC failed to show the conclusion of other
games because its feature game was over?  Sound familiar?

This year I'm getting twice the coverage.  I can see all the Caps
games *plus* the games ESPN shows.  I think it's great that hockey is
back on ESPN.  IMHO, they're doing a great job especially considering
the baseball contract they have to work around.

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell

Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. 
Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, 
the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large
piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains.

We must have been watching two different games.   The Devil had one hand on
Mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused Mario to fall so the call was
appropriate.

Using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of
confidence in your call either.  Next time consider getting a second opinion
from a clueful observer.  Or maybe all those available disagreed.

This clip was shown on local news in Pittsburgh last night (KDKA), complete

times he was blasting Lemieux.

What a surprise.  As long as the pool of talent is not accessible to all
teams, MLB won't let a few teams sign it.  Seems perfectly reasonable to
me.

They _finally_ started going to the net!  See what happens when you 
create some traffic?  Muller deserves full marks (what a player!),
and Damphousse finally started skating.  Roy (thankyouthankyouthankyou)
was excellent.  Did you see that third period save on Young?  And the 
defense was taking out Quebec players in the zone.

Anybody else wonder if Hextall will feel like a dweeb when he finds

I'd like to add that I think Canadian hockey fans like Don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his TV appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team NHL. So there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the Soviet series, Gretzky and even Bobby Orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. Who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in Canada and all the European in



fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.

Personally, I'd like to add before I get flamed, I love the fast-paced ""European"" game and think Don Cherry is a bit of an idiot. I have to say that I missed him when I was living in the States, though. He is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.

Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen.  For
most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity, 
it was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game...

Unfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits.  At first, I
immediately thought ""5 and a game"" because the hit _looked_ much more severe
from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay,
I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you 
slice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten
5 and the game.

>In the second period, behind Potvin, Probert had the puck, and was
>going to get out front, and was _tackled!_  I couldn't believe the no-call.

This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but
Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never
seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).  Now, if Probie
decides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?

This was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. I'm
really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s.
when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  

>But, when it all comes down to it, [Wings played like shit.....]

Yes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit
loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the
Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.

The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his
stick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I
have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an
asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. 
Murray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out
of him.

I agree. It was great for the ESPN people to show the Detroit game. (My
roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (Thanks
for explaining the significance of that BTW)) The only problem I had was
when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and
music. Especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. Other
then that, hats off to ESPN. Now if they'll only make a habit of this. Yeah

Just some thoughts:

I don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player,
but this time I couldn't resist.  During the Pens-Devils game
last night, second period, I think Kevin Stevens was in the
penalty box, Nicholls punched Kjell Samuellson in the face,
then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend
himself!  All Kjell could do, at 8'7"" and 355 pounds, was laugh!

And speaking of Swedish Penguins defensemen, Ulf is getting a
little out of hand lately.  His cheap shots are getting more
frequent and more violent.  As everybody in the Meadowlands
except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the
butt of his stick down one of the Devil's throat.  I've always
supported the argument ""he does his job by being irritating,""
but he's starting to push it over the edge IMHO.  Of course,
Holik's chop to Barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either.
It seems that he was following the ""The only way to beat the
Penguins is to injure them"" philosophy.

As my Modern Drama professor pointed out to me the other day,
Jagr was stoned pretty well Tuesday night, and last night as
well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the Devils end
was pretty exciting.

Roger,
Your responses might just exclude you from sharing your opinions,
then.  You see, the same rights Ali has to mail her letter to the NHL
are the same ones that let you post replies that mow her down like
wheat at harvest-time.  She never said she represented the entire
internet or the entire group rec.sport.hockey.  She has every right to
state her opinion along with those of the fifty or sixty or
hundred-odd folk who've agreed to allow her to list their names on the
bottom of it.  You may not agree with it.  Fine.  I really don't care
enough about the name change to care.  Your name isn't attached to it,
so why moan and complain?  If you felt her words were leading, well,
you're free to feel that way and take exception, but manners never
hurt.  I personally disagree and feel her generalizations were fine
(I have the right to think and say that, too).  Ali's under no
compunction to change a single word.  Now, while you're free to
disagree with every word she wrote, to tear apart her character is
uncalled for.  I'm posting this as a form of public reprimand.  If you
tear down Ali's integrity and character publicly, you'll get chastised
publicly in return.  Would it have been so hard to say, ""Ali, please
be a bit more specific in your description, the way I've read it
indicates you're stating my view also, and that's simply not true.
I'd really like to see a disclaimer noting that you don't mean the
entire internet or the entire r.s.h. group attached to it, despite
your intent to list names at the bottom.  Thanks.  Cordially as
always,"" &c.  Calling her a moron and an asshole just reduces the
weight of your words and the opinions of their author in the eyes of
myself, and possibly others.  

Oh, and Ali, nice to see someone standing up for something, even if
it's not something I personally advocate.  :-)

Hello Hockey fans.
Bonjour tout le monde!

Well, in Salt Lake City this past Sunday, the local ABC station decided not
to televise the hockey games.  La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!
Anyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can
not find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing
everything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.

I am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now
that ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to
pull in
three games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am
not sure.

IF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to
telent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.

Thanks in advance

(Detroit, April 19)

In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. 

The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior
Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of
Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior 
visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the league's best 
team.

Messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries.  While the press
made an issue of it, and attempted to link it to the Rangers' internal
political woes, Mike Keenan repeated that to Messier personally during
the MSG press conference.  It makes sense ... Messier would probably
have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity ...

It's pretty obvious that Holik's hitting Barrasso was an accident. He

Yeh,but :

1.Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.L wasn't very
impressive. His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs.
It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins.

2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their
entire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose
their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on
his head.

Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.
Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after
an incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major
leagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins'
flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about
15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics
and about 5% are on the Bruins.
Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding

Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is
custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a
plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  
John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.

Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I
would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome!

Have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? It seems that e.g. glove
has become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are
wearing ""over size"" jerseys. Am I dreaming? If you watch old photos or
films let say about ten years back, I think the difference is quite obvious.
Who is an expert on this, please let me know. (Or have the goalies become
bigger?)

It looks like the Edmonton Oilers just decided to take a European
vacation this spring...

Ranford, Tugnutt, Benning, Manson, Smith, Buchberger, and Corson
are playing for Canada.

Podein and Weight are playing for the US.

Is Kravchuk playing for the Russians...I know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

Podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in Cape Breton in the AHL playoffs like Kovalev, Zubov,
and Andersson...obviously Sather and Pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
in this case they've massively outclassed Paramount and the
New York Rangers.

Being a a BLUES fan I don't get to see much else from around the league
with the exception of Hockey Night on ESPN.  I can't get the BLUES games
where I go to school, thus I don't get to see a whole lot of other teams
play except for the Hawks.  But last night I got to catch a glimpse of
the Caps/Isles game.  It occurred to me that Turgeon is a stud on skates.
His moves are quick and brilliant.  You NY fans should be proud.
P.S. Who won the game (Caps/Isles)?

Well, I don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist 
who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression
came from _him_ (Steve Simmons?).  Besides, to my knowledge Alex has a pretty
fair grasp of the English language...and his recent comment after the Detroit

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might have
to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the
street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,
or even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick them
up earlier now, though.

Well that's really great Pat.  I guess since you've played a little you thereby 
qualify as an expert.  Especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  All 
that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato

Pat Walker

Again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  Truly a 
stupid statement.  Mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.
I'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to
mind when that question is asked.  Let's face it, he just returns from 
radiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes Lafontaine for the
scoring lead and then buries him!!!!  No, I guess he just got lucky.
Speaking of Lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the
Hart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this
year.

It was not just those penalties. Most of all it was the penalty the referee didn't

Don't you think it's quite silly to call it a Nazi attitude, when some people 
throw coins on the ice? Hey, I don't approve the behavior of these guys,
especially not in a WC game, but I can't see any reason for using the word 'Nazi'
in this connection.

Soccer hooligans are not just a German problem (remember the world cup in Italy).
Again: there's a big difference between throwing coins and smashing shop-windows
or fighting with other so-called 'fans', who come to a WC just to see if the
Dutch or the English or the Germans are the best bruisers.
Which other sports are you talking about? I don't think soccer is 'every possible
sport'.

How many Germans do you know? Do you think 200 out of 10000 is 'most of them'? 
If you hear about some white policemen beating a black man in the US, what do you
think about the Americans? 'Most of them' like beating blacks?

Bryan Murray has done very little as GM...Yzerman, Fedorov, Cheveldae,
Chaisson, the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous
GM...Murray has made a couple of decent trades...that's about it...
that would hardly rank him as the best GM.

Wasn't Primeau, Murray's first decision as GM...

 I agree with Rick that Ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. It was the kind
 of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos
 sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.
 Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.

 Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league
 team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years
 here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship
 game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,
 but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to
 have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)
 As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in
 division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,
 and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is
 considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is
 Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play
 in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.
 I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
 watch in Swedish hockey this season.

Over 84 games, Gretzky's total projected 226 points.

The 76-77 Canadiens had .825 percentage, 132 pts in 80 games. (60-8-12).
The 29-30 Bruins had a .875 winning percentage.
Also the 77-78 Canadiens had a .806 percentage with a 59-10-11 record.

Here is a press release from the White House.

 Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team
April 19; Q&A Following
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript
of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""Black
Bears"" NCAA Division I hockey champions:

                           The Rose Garden

 9:58 A.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's
an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the
winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the
Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell
that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win
a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.

     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory.

     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can
understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.
In our state people are still talking about the time we won the
Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was
back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine
will as proud of this team as they are today.

     You know, in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)
But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I
can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came
here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does
have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish
we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)

     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In
the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority
Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior
Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm
actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger
than me.

     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done
a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship
game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I
know a little bit about.

     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and
Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine
must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from
behind.

     I think it's important, as I ask young people from
around America who have achieved outstanding things in working
together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and
appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives.

     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have
them here today.  (Applause.)

     (The President is presented with team jersey.)
(Applause.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.
(Applause.)

     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)

                             * * * * * *

     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco
this morning, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney
General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions
to her and to the FBI.

     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.
That was their judgment, the FBI.

     Q  Is this a raid?

     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --
talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be
done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical
decisions.

     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this
morning?

     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my
quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).

     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator
Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.

     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen
this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to
have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to
talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and
talk some more.

     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise.

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator
Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for
the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28
emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan
and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people
back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you


can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position
they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year
deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time
and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their
position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to
work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.
We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good
about it.

     THE PRESS:  Thank you

                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT

* The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated $5M
in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket-holders (!), plus
Paramount chief Stan Jaffe's chip against the Flyers over l'Affaire
Lindros last autumn.  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an
assistant coach [Gerald, what'd I say earlier today??], and Roger
conferred with Jaffe on the hiring.  This hiring by Jaffe went over

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
that the NHL could expand in Europe.

Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing
to play for a team in Europe?

I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)

When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:

- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)
- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.
- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.
- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.

I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:

- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french
  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One
  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.

Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved
to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league
(2 years ago?)

I wonder what the players association thinks about going to Europe.

Myself I would like to see some European teams, but what would be 
the best way to do it?

Funny you should mention this; one time on HNIC Don Cherry pointed out
Vanbiesbrouck's mask.  He _hated_ it.  I think he said something to the effect
of:
""You see?  He was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask

You may or may not take Cherry seriously at all, but I cracked up when I heard
it.

I think Ed Belfour has the current best mask in the NHL btw.  I also like
Moog's, and I'll give Fuhr's new one an honourable mention, although I haven't
seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  What's also neat is
Chevaldae's in Detroit; they call him ""Chevy"" so he has two checkered flags
painted at the top as in an auto race.

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.
The ""whole Russian strategy"" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,
who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most
notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).

Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the 
league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.

1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.
--------------------------------
Playoffs:
---------
*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme
by Rick Sadowski, Daily News

Barry Melrose's decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
fun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I
think I have worked hard enough for that.""

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
6-3 opening victory.

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick
Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.

Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.

Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn.

""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I
dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd be
happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.""

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,
according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday.

""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""

""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've
got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect
more from him than he does.""

Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.

""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,
a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""

""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry 
doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm
a perfectionist.""

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But 
even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's 
a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game 
you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 
and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain 
to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I 
do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.""

Melrose's ""goalie of the future"" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. ""Before
you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,"" he said.

I've heard that this is because most of their market is East Coast and hence
would prefer the Wales stuff.  Also, don't expect Canadian teams on ESPN.

In summary, if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage, 
watch CBC from Canada.  They may be biased toward Canadian teams, but they
don't treat the viewers like idiots, they provide nice updates, and Don Cherry
will always provide a few laughs.

I am sorry to tell you this, but

There was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams
no matter ow bad they are. That's bullshit. Anyone who would follow the
Pens or the Pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are
losers. It's OK to follow and be concerned about your home team. But
to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck
should not be required of a true fan.A  true fan would follow the team in
troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.

When I visit PIttsburgh, I'll refuse to go to a Pirates game since I think
the management has given PIttsburgh a team which could have been much better
even if they couldn't sign Barry Bonds. Lert's say the Pens start doing to
their own team what the Oilers have done this year and what the Whalers have
done in recent years, I would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the
team. I'll still follow it and bitch about it. But I won't waste my
money on mediocre teams.

NESN owns the rights to Bruin telecasts.  I suspect that NESN was only
going to sell one telecast to ESPN (remember, ESPN only owns exclusive
rights to the FINALS, not the entire playoffs).  Since ESPN bought the
SCA contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the Devils
and Penguins.

I think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it.  Plus they
have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule
unless the NHL was willing to make a western club move up their game.
I think the NHL got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for ABC.

I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.
In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person
is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably
be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.

He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad
stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took
that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived
in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't
and wouldn't play a lick of defense.

It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought
all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has
certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up
permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it
wouldn't matter.

If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would

What, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that
there WERE NO OTHER NIGHT BASEBALL GAMES? Every break they took back at
the studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey
instead.' My wife and I are hoping for rain at every baseball game they

Point is, be glad they showed hockey, but if baseball was available

Local to the Joe Louis Arena? You mean local to Olympia Stadium, where
Red Wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to
mind). As far as I know, the rest of the post is basically correct. If
what you meant by local was simply Detroit and I'm being incredibly
picky, okay, sorry about that.

Lines: 125


  The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period
and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.
Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17
seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.
Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good
goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the Blues lead.

The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and
taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty
on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired
a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After
the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
10-9 in the first period.

Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown
collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.

Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a
short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy
Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass
across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.

Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.
Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat
Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan
deflected the puck in the net.

Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the
rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for
the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues
outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.

With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith
was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.

The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle.

Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson
Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with
two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.

The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy
Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.
The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the
puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held
on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,
totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent
in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on
on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.
 
The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an
All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when
CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday
in St. Louis.

No, and in fact, that was Ferreira's original strategy, which the troika
proceeded to simply continue to implement. There wasn't exactly a radical
shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The
only real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if
he stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been
quoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the
Ducks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,
and he's tweaking it a bit second time around). One also has to wonder
whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we hadn't had those
injuries, and whether we're complaining about the weather because an
earthquake collapsed the root cellar.

>Of course, Ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal

Let's also NOT FORGET that Ferreira came *THIS* close to trading Kelly
Kisio, which, if the rumors I've heard are true, was over the strong
objections of other aspects of Shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the three-headed, consensus oriented GM.

Imagine, for a second, where the Sharks would be today if that fax machine
hadn't jammed.

>With or without Mullen, they weren't going to be a playoff team; what good

Especially an unhappy player that isn't playing as well because of it. Not
that I'd accuse Mullen of tanking, but his motivation simply wasn't there,
and that kind of thing can affect the team.

>Right balance for what?  That's the issue.  

Exactly. At the time they let Skriko go, we hadn't yet had the major injury
bugs that killed us later. I'd much rather have Skriko around than someone
like Dean Kolstad, but at that point, that wasn't the choice. And since the
choice was more one of Skriko vs. someone like John Carter, I think the
right choice was made for that time period.

""Deeply rooted rivalry?"" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined
the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since
1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think
you're exagerating here.

That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &
American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our
set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about
as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean
Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in
the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn 
McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 
3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the 
Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled
from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford 
or Tampa Bay currently are doing.
---
But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up
with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and
no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? 
Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:

(28-30=superstar)
(23-27=star)
(18-22=NHL regular+)
(13-17=NHL regular)
( 8-12=role player)

FINLAND:  

D-Jyrki Lumme.......20
D-Teppo Numminen....20
D-Peter Ahola.......13

C-Jari Kurri........25
C-Christian Ruuttu..16

R-Teemu Selanne.....27

L-Esa Tikkanen......20
(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)

SWEDEN:
D-Ulf Samuelsson....21
D-Fredrik Olausson..20
D-Niklas Lidstrom...18
D-Calle Johansson...18
D-Kjell Samuelsson..17
D-Tommy Sjodin......13
D-Tommy Albelin......7

C-Mats Sundin.......26
C-Thomas Steen......18

R-Thomas Sandstrom..22
R-Ulf Dahlen........18
R-Michael Nylander..13

L-Per-Erik Eklund...18
L-Johan Garpenlov...16
L-Mikael Andersson..15
L-Jan Erixon........14

This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's
Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's
Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But
I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did
well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's
presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be
that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.
---
Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.
Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top
players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in 
Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.
Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on
Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high
as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talk
isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,
won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably
play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top 
Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a 
couple of years the same way Edmonton's ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late '80s. 
Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a 
compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during 
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone.

Clement, although he has a pleasant personality (aggravatingly pleasant

Did they move Probert back to defense?  Why did I see him parking his ass
in front of Potvin all night?  Somebody is going to have to discipline
Probert if the Leafs want to win the series.  Perhaps a fresh Clark should
hit the ice at the end of a long Probert shift and straigten him out for
a while...

	Well, Druce pretty much sucked when he was with the Caps. He had one
good **playoffs** (not season). oh well. The Caps are notorious for making
stupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the Cicarelli and Hrivnak trades.
Sigh.
	In another note... I'd have to say the Caps biggest surprise was 
Cote, as many Caps fans had been expecting a lot from Bondra already.

Buffalo fans:

Some people in the discussion group, as well as ""commentator Al"" on ESPN, 
believe that game 3 is critical for the Sabres.  HELLOOOO!!!!! The Sabres 
are AHEAD 2 games to 0, not behind.  As a life-long Sabres fan, I am well 
aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  As long as 
the Sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 OR game 4), they are 
still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at 
Buffalo.  If they lose games three AND four, then start worrying.  Game 3 is 
critical for Boston, not Buffalo.

   Why would Pollin want to move the Caps, because I think he
owns the Cap Centre.  I know they don't sell out all of their 
games, but they draw a lot more than the Bullets.  If you
had the situation that Abe had, would you move if you were
guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to 
park at the stadium, because there has been nothing within
a half mile, until the recent construction in
the area.
   Can they win a game in OT again.

Generally I agree with you. However, (1) last night ESPN cut away to Baseball
Tonite, which looks like SportsCenter tailored to baseball, and they cut
away at 7:40 pacific. That's quite a contract they have there. (2) if
ESPN couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to
let SportsChannel pick up the slack.

Nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the US-American public that regular
season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the U.S.
Support your team; support your game.

Somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write Chrysler
to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
consider their products. Here's an equally excellent idea, watch
baseball for 10 minutes (I know I'm asking a lot, but that's what spew
bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters
complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
that you won't consider buying their products because of it.

Two points, one what does r.s.b.c. have to do with hockey?  Secondly, UMASS
beat my Quakers???  Hello!!!  Earth here, are you responding???  We're not in
the Atlantic 10 (or 8 whatever you wanna call it), we're in the Big 10 now!!!
The A-10 was too weak for my Lady Lions -- they had to go to a more challenging
conference.  It didn't pay off as the Big East showed them a thing or too, but
I still posted on a regular basis and tracked all the women's scores with
reviews throughout the tournament.  It wasn't a reason to stop posting. :-)

>BTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more

It's not over yet -- if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games, I think
Boston can do it, but I still see Buffalo winning in 6.

>diciplined, and with more will to win.  They deserve it.

Agreed -- they're playing tremendous hockey right now.  Congatualtions on three
straight Buffalo.  It could very easily be 2-1 Boston, but Buffalo has come up
tough and a little luck.  (You never see a penalty in OT that doesn't have both
sides involved in a playoff game.  Never never never!)

It would seem logical that the mask is Potvins. His nickname is ""The Cat"", 
which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther. 

Of course, it could be an old story and the mask is Fuhrs, too.....

Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is
only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this
for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes.  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff
""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living. 

Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The 
emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year.  They proved it.

cordially, as always,

From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than

Anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesn't
care where they get basketball players from, major league baseball
doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except Cuba,
that is).

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary 
supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia
are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the
potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and
the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue
to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future.

Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.

Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate,
if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again,
the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near
team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of 
Americans, not because of Europeans.

First,Happy Birthday,Val. Second, ESPN's affinity with Patrick has probably
more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week NHN(National Hockey
Night) affair.(ESPN-ABC owner,Capital Cities, is a company known for being
quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. It's quite possible that Jim
Schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).

Gary Thorne and Bill Clement are both NJ-based and the rest of ESPN crew
resides in the suburban CT with a very close proximity to tri-state area.
Plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the NorthEast
corridor(PA-NY-NJ-DC/Maryland). Whereas,in the Adams you have only
3-American based teams, out of which 2(Buffalo and Hartford) are not

If life were so simple!  Savard has not played in three of the last 
four games and they are still playing like crap.  Montreal's problems
run deeper than Savard (and Mouton) unfortunately; I hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs.

The line-up in their game coming up against PittsburgH is said to be
the one they're likely to use for the playoffs.  Let's hope they can
forget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey.

Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. 
A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear
with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd
have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also
have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
different.

Perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (I am
starting to sound like Roger or what?)

The last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the
playoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques
Demers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,
embarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the 
playoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the
Norris).

It's true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before 
Quinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--
tougher division than the Norris, also known as the ""Snorris"", division.
Vancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley
Cup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such 
powerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while
over this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was 
everybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a
lot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.

Bryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good
players, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And
no doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the
coaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.

>So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.
>Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.

There are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn't in as bad a shape standings
wise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which
I outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player
cannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I'm sure everyone
reading this will agree.  

We'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final (assuming they don't get knocked out,
like last year).

But I gotta tell ya,

If the Hawks can't beat the Blues in a game that
IS significant I can't wait to see how the Blues
might do against Toronto ;)

BTW, if you think that the Hawks deserved to win that game
I think you were not watching the same one everyone else
was.

I believe that Phil Esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played
with the Rangers in the '70s.  This was the season that they put the
Rangers crest and ""modern-style"" numbers on the jerseys instead of the
""NEW YORK"" or ""RANGERS"" block letters and two-colour numbers.  He took #77
because the Rangers already had a #7.

(Hockey Night in Canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the
biggest uniform style change in a long time.  This was before Pittsburgh
and Vancouver changed their colours.)

For those of you who read TV Guide, there's an article in next week's
SPORTSVIEW concerning the NHL and major network broadcasting. Pretty
interesting.

     As a person who has rarely even SEEN Don Cherry and doesn't know
anything about him, I don't know whether it is just this area
(Pittsburgh) of the USA that is ""deprived"" of his broadcasts or whether
he's a Canadian thing altogether.  Seriously, what is he all about?  I
know he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,
SOMEONE surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question
is, what is the deal with him?  Secondly, are the comments of his that I
read about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him
seriously?  I gotta tell you, from what I see, he really sounds like an
ass.  Let me know - maybe I'm missing something.

Yes, Colin... I have to agree with you here...  I've put the puck in
my own net the same way Smith did... (only once, mind you :-) and it
was definitely my fault.  It is NOT a common play to play the puck the
way that Smith did.  

Luckily, for me...  when I did it... it was only a scrimmage :-)

Good point - there haven't even been any recent posts about Ulf! 
Secretly, I'm convinced that he's responsible for the Bs being down 3-0

Well, since someone probably wanted to know, here's this year's playoff
matchups on the left, and what the matchups would be next year under the
new alignment and playoff-matchup rules.  The same 16 teams make the playoffs

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said
that he isn't the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.
If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup
by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
so none of this is true anyway.

	Team Canada defeated Russia 3-1 to finish the priliminary 
round unbeaten at 5-0. Scoring for the Canadians were Kevin Dineen of 
the Flyers, Eric Lindros also of the Flyers and Paul Cariya of the 
Maine Black Bears. Cariya has put on quite a show at the Worlds. He is 
sure to be drafted in the top 3 this summer at the NHL entry draft.

	Canada defeated Italy 11-2 and Austria 11-0 before meeting the 
Russians on Sunday. The Canadians now face Finland in the Quarter -

   >

     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than
     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
     time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the
fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you
that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-
comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone
would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way
play.

In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked
to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he
can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center
is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the
other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get
90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.

(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy
floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like
overtime of playoff games).

Not only that, but if I'm not mistaken Detroit scored 4 goals on their first
five shots on net...looks like Toronto's cream cheese run continues (or is
that swiss cheese? after watching Potvin I'm leaning towards the latter)

Detroit is a very disciplined team.  There's a lot of Europeans
in Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have
to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last
resort anyway.  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get
more good players.  Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn't
Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner.  Everyone knows that.
and it's going to take time for Toronto to become a real force.
I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year.  He can't pull the
whole team forever.

The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere.

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his ""last"" stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial
government is months away from a provincial election...it is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...
and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.

Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.

He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesn't.

Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.

However, in this case, about the long-term financial
viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke
the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money.

Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in
the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

I disagree.  I think the NHL should feature the best hockey talent in
the world -- regardless of nationality.  I have to admit that when I 
see players like Gretzky and Messier traded off to the US because the
Canadian teams can't afford them, I have been know to say (only half-
seriously) that we'd probably be better off if we had our own Canadian
hockey league for Canadian players! ;-)

    Well, in my opinion the Canucks played a really strong game. I was
especially pleased by a very strong game from Linden - I think he
could be a key to success for them this year.  Defensively, they
really had a strong game.  Hardly heard Selanne's name all night.
Craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  With a
few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying Jets do much
high-flying.  I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the
Canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to
make this a series.

    In short, it was a great start!

This is the new Buffalo one, the second since he's been with the

that mask, and a total price of almost $1500.  Ouch.

This game would have been great as part of a double-header on ABC or
ESPN; the league would have been able to push back-to-back wins by
Le Magnifique and The Great One.  Unfortunately, the only network
that would have done that was SCA, seen in few areas and hard to
justify as a pay channel. )-;

I'm personally expecting Moog.  Blue played fairly decent (alright
spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but Moog has the experience.
What Did Blue have going for him, nothing, What would happen in a Tie
game, the prssure is then on the Goal tender to insure that you keep the
puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  Blue didn't face that
kind of pressure on Tuesday.  The Bruins will come out storming that
is for sure.  I really think that this series is up to Buffalo, Boston
(except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad
,  As a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the
puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.  There game plan is
sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo.....

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a ""no-brainer"". 
The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best
player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. 

The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without 
Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. 

Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a 
Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion, 
but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs.

I agree, with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and 
third. I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest
surprise, even though I personally do not really rate him well. The biggest 
disappointment has to be Carson. Though this is really unfair, since too much 
was expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his 
adolescent handling of the goaltending problems. Putting Hrudey on the bench 
for a month is just stupid. It did not contribute to the team coming out of 
its slump. MVP is surely Robitaille.

I dunno about hat. I have friends up there on GEnie who are now saying that
Ottawa's gone soft on Daigle and is thinking hard about Pronger. Daigle has
shown an Attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,
and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being
stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. His stock is dropping like a
rock. 

Also remember that a lot of teh ""draft 1st"" stuff comes from the assumption
he'll be traded to Quebec for lots of prospects. It's not clear that 
Quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status. He's still first round, but I don't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point.

It's also possible that the Senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price, since Daigle has been taking some Lindros lessons during thos
suspensions.

No. Kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not
leaving college, and I don't believe ANY of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not
when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
an immediate impact. San jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
Niedermayer for that reason. Kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can
convince him to leave school early (which I doubt).


My cut on things as they stand today:

>1) Ottawa (60% Daigle, if not, 40% Pronger)

I would have chosen Alex Zhitnik for biggest suprise.  They
did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but I don't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
rookie year.  His speed, skating ability, and puck control is

Whoa.  What you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  Ths
is not so.  Roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he
allowed a very cheap goal.  If you think Roy outplayed Hextall, perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third
period.  NHL goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  If they did not, they
would not be in the NHL in the first place.  I do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they
are occasionally required.  However, when it comes to a routine shot like
Sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, I don't think there 
are any legitimate excuses. 

>Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces 
>[description of lucky bounces.....]

I am not arguing that Hextall was brilliant.  I am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
in a goal. 

> ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against

In a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the 1 goal'.  I have not defended Dionne for taking the penalty
either...in fact I think it was a boneheaded move.  But it led to _one_ goal
only, and Montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  My main concern is the second 
goal.

What you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  But realize that the 
game was effectively *won*.  You could watch any hockey game (in fact, you
could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  They are not important when the final
result is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive
screwups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie
is the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*
goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.

>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. 

WHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if
you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times.

>Roy is paid big money because
>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5

For the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league.  In fact, I agree that he is.

>The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
>comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans.
                            
I assume you are referring to me.  However, I have pointed out that I think
the loss can be blamed on Roy.  I have not said he sucks, nor do I think I've
made any other 'derogatory comments'.  If you regard objective
(and informed, FYI) observations as derogatory, I really can't help you.

scored a rare Jets shorthanded goal as the Jets held on to beat the
Canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  Trevor Linden and Pavel
Bure had two goals each for the Canucks in a losing cause.

Selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay
goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from Darrin Shannon.

Hard work paid off tonight for the Jets, and if the Jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (I woofed
last year when we were up 3-1...I ain't going to do THAT again.  I'll
have to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)

If you're going to go to those extremes, I guess you'd better start

Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who
retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?
After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.
Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in
reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,
unless you're a franchise player.

In four of the five games Finns have played, the goalie has been chosen
the best player of the opposing team. (In the fifth, the finnish goalie, 
Ketterer was elected the best Finn) Has this to do with the goalies 
having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy
scorers???

Anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
(the exception of course being Canada vs. Italy).  It looks like the
goalies are getting too good.  Is this due to their equipment getting
bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger
now than they were some years ago).

Anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????

Gerry Cheevers used to have a mask that had stitches painted all over

Ken Dryden's mask is a classic - an archetype of our time.

  Yup. I agree with ya. I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily. SO I think
  all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams
  before voting. I think Islanders and Quebec are much better then I had

Thanks.  For speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important
enough to say something themselves.  

I wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to.  It represents a subset (that you
don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this
isn't a moderated group).

Look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  Three
that come to mind are as follows:

1) Say it subtly.  Result: it may not be clear.
2) Say it directly yet politely.  Result: probably it will spark some 
   interesting conversation.
3) Say it directly and obnoxiously.  Result: validity goes right out
   the window.

>I would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.

You realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be
used against you.

 Switzerland beat Sweden in a WC for the first time since 1950, and the Swiss
 now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals (if Austria beats
 Italy tonight).

 The Swiss took the lead after Hakan Ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop
 pass at his own blue line, and Celio came in alone with Soderstrom and beat
 Tommy to the stick side. The Swedes continued to make mistakes as Howald
 was allowed to skate in between the Swedish D and put the puck past Tommy
 to make it 0-2. 0-3 was a nice one, Howald entered the Swedish zone, slammed
 on the breaks, and his shot went in by Tommy's far post. One of the lousiest
 periods I've seen Sweden play this year.
 Second period saw a new Swedish team, and the Swiss had to ice the puck many
 times. On a pp, Nylander skated in from the boards, Pavoni made the initial
 save, but Peter Andersson scored on the rebound.  Then a power play goal
 from the Swiss, a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way
 to the goal and past Soderstrom also. Jonas Bergqvist made it 2-4 after a
 nice pass from Naslund behind the goal. Jan Larsson reduced the lead to 3-4
 just before the end of 2nd period, on a pp skated in unattacked in front of
 the goal, and put the puck through Pavoni's 5-hole. 
 Third period, Sweden equalized on a slap shot from Renberg that trickled
 through Pavoni's 5-hole. Then, another defensive mistake by the Swedes,
 Waeger was allowed to skate around the Swedish goal unattacked and from close
 range could make it 4-5. Hollenstein then scored 4-6 on a 2-on-1 break away,
 and put it top shelf with no chance for Soderstrom.

 3rd:

 Penalties: RUS 2*2min 1*5min, CAN 5*2min
 Referee: Anton Danko, Czech republic
 Attendance: 8,600

 Russia probably made their best game of the tourney, but yet there wasn't
 enough to win against the effective Canadians.

 Galley took a slap shot that found Dineen by the far post, and Dineen just
 deflected the puck past Trefilov in the Russian goal. Then a power play
 goal, after a couple of deflections Eric Lindros found Kariya alone by the
 far post, and Kariya put the puck high over a sliding Trefilov.
 Russia won the shots in the first period 12-5, and they had the most of
 the scoring opportunities, but they just couldn't score.
 Second period saw Lindros scoring his 10th (!!) goal of the WC. Kariya
 entered the Russian zone, slammed on the break to get past his defenseman,
 then made a nice pass to Corson who just got the stick on the puck to
 deflect it to Lindros who one-timed the puck.
 The Russians then finally got their goal, Karpov broke in from the side
 and made a slap shot in Tugnutt's top right hand corner.
 
 Player of the game in Canada was voted Paul Kariya, and for Russia Valeri
 Karpov. I agree, the difference in this game was Lindros and Kariya, and
 in part also Tugnutt. Kariya had a far better game now than vs the Swedes,
 and he was very impressive. Kariya got the place in the line with Lindros
 after Mike Gartner went out with a rib-injury early in the first period.

 Lindros, BTW, lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9+5) before this game,
 7 pts ahead of the next player! i.e. double as much as the next player
 (among those Kariya with 1+6). Amazing!

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,
kept harping about how they ""must have had a different view upstairs""
because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who
saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay ""judges"" initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is
unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year.

cordially, as always,

From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith
came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the
back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what
happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never
had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan
of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. 

It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting
in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of 
their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the 
goaltender, or whatever.

And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only
say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.
There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late
in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team
has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.

What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and
I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there
is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits
Pat Burns.

If you were Pat Burns what would you do?

Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments
on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic
idea...

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success
will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have
any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the
hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples
skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.
He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  

Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.
I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.
These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour
should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a
nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  
Score Gilmour score!

Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??
	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line
	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)

* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up
		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,
		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then
		let them play.

** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.
** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.
** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and
out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.

Well, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is
not entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey
season is starting!!!!!

Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the
number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be
weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the
early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:

Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points
Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points
Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points

Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points
Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points
Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points

Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points
Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points
Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points

Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points
Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points
Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points
(these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)

Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some
tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to
modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms,
well, this post is getting too long, so see next post.

Nntp-Posting-Host: st-lina.cs.ualberta.ca
Organization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada
Lines: 68



Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18, 1993.
It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec
series. 

Pre-game comments
-----------------
Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie
who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series
for his team.

Eposode Summary
---------------
This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that
he bought from the concession stand.

Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the
Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow
and proclaimed ""Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks
of me. Beauty.""

Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to
him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all
the arenas in the NHL.

From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game
had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game
in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All
stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary
by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most
penalties gets to ref in the finals.

Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for
the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the
wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup
and the AHL championships.

Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the
Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.
Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had
several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who
went cold.

Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,
Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer
be a 'country club'.... ""NY should be achamed of themselves... If
they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the
yardarm by their thumbs.""


Rating
------
Nothing too special in this episode.

I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.

As far as Cheveldae is concerned, he is a decent goalie.  The most logical
trade in the offseason to me would be between Detroit and NY Rangers.  I'm sure
if Beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
roots in Detroit.  He would be a valuable asset to the Wings and Perhaps the
Rangers could get a Zombo in return?  Beezer got a few good years in him and
the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

Stauber will be in net on Tuesday.  Hopefully he will provide another

I believe this is how they are...I know it is Gretzky and Sandstrom, but he
has been putting a number of people on left.  Also the Carson, Robataille
Kurri line once ignited, will light the fire of the other lines.

It is evident that the scoring drought is getting to Luc, after his slight
breakaway in the third (I think) he was steamed on the bench, this emotion
might help him break his streak.  Also, I have noticed Blake has had a few
really good chances to score, but has fanned, or shot wide.  Is the injury
still affecting him?

You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays
the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists
through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players.
Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been
out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed
and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players
like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed
to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000
aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get
a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.
The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a
Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers
in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not
even notice he's gone. He's an eyesore on the game of hockey.

Sorry, my memory is gone. I thought that O'Neill got sent back
down in February but I must have been given incorrect info. I guess
this says it all about Moncton because Barnes is still one of
their top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since January.

As I've mentioned in the rules posting, I will be out of town until the
day before the entry deadline, so I won't be able to respond to your
messages until April 18.

I would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for
the playoff pool sometime next week, for the benefit of those who missed the
first two postings.

Thanks.

Ah well, another Brian Sutter team is ground into the dirt with intensity
during the regular season and then is burned out by playoff time.
Yah Fuhr has been awesome so far, but really you'd think Sutter would have
learned his lesson about pushing his team too far during the regular season.

Well, as long as we're being unduly cocky here, It's obvious that the Pens
will cone out of the Patrick Division *not* the Caps, and also that
they will win thier third Stanley Cup. ""Collective Wisdom"" is a very polite
way of putting it, I don't know if I'd be so gracious.
And, for what it's worth (Probably not much) I think the Habs will come out of
the Adams too.

I agree with Joseph.  Felix Potvin is a great goalie.  Besides,
I thought that the Leafs could only protect goalie in the up-coming
expansion draft.  If so, then it's better to get rid of one good
goalie and get a good forward in return.

So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,
Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.
Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good
teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.

YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.
Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a
coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto
game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a
great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.

But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel
doesn't have a game like that in him.

Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,
Dom has played well too.

FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,
Kasper...

Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.

The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,
a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri
Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS
never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an
NHL record 9th OT loss this season.

Game Summary:

I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts
I didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by
a few things I did pick up:

First Period:
	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51
	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)
Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,
Har (interference) 18:43

Second Period:
	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00
	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09
	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38
Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har
major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,
Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50

Third Period:
	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)
	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11
	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38
Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30

Overtime:
	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.
Penalties - None

Power Play:
	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4

Goalies:
	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)
	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the
game and the league, how come you haven't made a living out of it?
There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure
you'd be of great help to, say, the Leafs as an assistant coach or
a scout. Or maybe try a career as a reporter or tv commentator...
 
I might be wrong, of course, and you already have.

 Finland     12 10 11 - 33       6*2min,1*10min                (Sweden)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish
 blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and
 shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner. Ville Siren's slap
 shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi
 scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
 put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.
 The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo
 made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,
 during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.
 Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to
 Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered
 the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund 
 skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.
 Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line
 where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since
 there was traffic in front, 4-3.
 Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan ""the Shadow"" Nilsson. Stefan
 and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to
 Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.
 Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only
 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone 
 with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja
 made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.
 The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal
 late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,
 showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck
 and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.
 But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the
 game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
 angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.

 All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.
 Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
 to try no combinations.

 Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-
 Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.
 Stillman good on defense.
 Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson
 will likely have to leave for NHL pros.

 Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the
 Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him
 a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.
 I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-
 resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.

I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggest
surprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....
  
MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
      in terms of leadership (""can't win without him"")
  
Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player
      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even
      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not
      even have been in the team's plans).
   
Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I
      picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on
      offence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)

The problem is that (by no fault of ESPN) ongoing games are not
covered 'til the final horn sounds.  With two channels, SCNY and SCA,
late-finishing games (up to Pacific time) and overtimes elsewhere will
kick in at the end of local coverage.  If SCNY is blocked by the Mets,
there is still some hockey on SCA (SCNY Plus).

With an ESPN 2, the current situation would be alleviated.

Farewell, Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.

As the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are
not long without an NHL team.  It just seems ""right"" that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the
1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).

I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf
Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got it
to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What a
glorious season that was for the North Stars!

Francis got 101 in 89-90, his last full season with Hartford.

In agreement with your previous post, I think Francis is a tremendous and
generally underrated complete player.  I would LOVE to have him here in a
Capitals uniform where he would certainly be the #1 center (even though
Pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated).
Francis impresses me in many ways as an ""ethical Dale Hunter"".  Tons of
heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills, but none of
the cheap shots and few penalty minutes.  Not to mention nearly always
coming through when it's important.

While I will first congratulate the Blues for their victory, I think it must
be realized that the primary reason the Blues were able to win was Curtis   
Joseph.  When a goalkeeper gets hot, there is little an opposing team can do.
Joseph should be given the entire city of St. Louis, because otherwise there 
would probably be a game 6 scheduled.  

As for the game on Sunday.  The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.
One was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to
give them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck
hit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot
for Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'
goals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone
who didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.
Finally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.  No goalie, no way to stop the shot.

I congratulate St. Louis for beating the Hawks.  It will be a shame to see
Bryan Murray finally advance to the Campbell Conference Finals because Joseph
won't be able to stop the powerful Red Wing attack.

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear
nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  
Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the
NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will
object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an ""Americanization""
of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and
whether it is ""American"" or not is irrelevant.

Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you would
have to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.
And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
the more meaningful contribution.

It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?

These new rule changes are great!  However, I think that your rules are
MUCH too complicated.  How will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has?  And then we would even have to remember the
names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  And, of
course, there will have to be new ""sub-positions"", like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,
and the ""shooting defenseman"" and the ""point defenseman"".  Finally, we'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. 
Since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to
see Ulf Samuellson (sp?) and Tie Domi miss penalty shots like crazy.

Well, I could become a fan ... (-;

Seriously, this news coming since Thursday has effectively robbed the
Islanders and the Devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that I've sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost don't
exist now. )-; Ranger fans calling in to WFAN or to New York One's

orgasm over Keenan's hiring.  (Summarizing: Keenan is a winner and
will give the Broadway Bums 'da business' in pursuing the next Cup

This will be an interesting combination to watch ... Keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  A lot of big
player moves will happen --- remember that Keenan got rid of Denis
Savard.  The country club days are over ...

If Paramount had given Smith an earlier sign of support and offered
Keenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in January, the
Rangers might not be heading for golf now ...

One of Keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that Mark Messier

By then, Smith might have some bargains on Keenan's advice ... like

It was unlikely, improbable.  For the Bruins, it was the stuff of
nightmares; for the Sabres, it was a taste of heaven.  
   For the first time since 1983, the Sabres have won the first three
games of a series.  Last time was a three games to none victory in a
best of five against the Canadiens.  It takes a little more work this
time.  The Sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.
   On the heels of a shutout, one that took away Boston's home ice
advantage, the Sabres came back with a four to three overtime win.  It
wasn't easy.  It wasn't always pretty.  It still worked.
   John Blue got the nod for Boston, supplanting Andy Moog as starting
goaltender.  Moog was pulled midway through game 2 on Tuesday.
Buffalo started with a goal by Mogilny, his fourth of the playoffs, on
the powerplay, with Boston's Don Sweeney and Gord Roberts in the box.
LaFontaine and Hawerchuk had the assists.  Goal number two was
Khmylev's first of the playoffs, a pretty goal scored when the Sabres
stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting Khmylev.  Smehlik and
Hannan assisted.  Determined not to be shut out, Boston tallied on a
shot by Ray Bourque on the powerplay, with Colin Patterson and Bob
Sweeney both in the box.  Period two was scoreless, a split of
penalties between the two clubs.  The third saw Boston's Smolinski get
his first, courtesy of Oates.  Buffalo resecured the lead two minutes
later, from former Bruin Bob Sweeney (Khmylev and Carney).  Neely tied
the game 3/4 of the way through the third, sending it into overtime.
Last year overtime meant a Bruin win.  Last night, it spelled sweet
revenge, as Buffalo scored with Ray Bourque in the penalty box, on a
tip in by Khmylev (Hawerchuk and LaFontaine) a minute into overtime.
Both teams finished with 34 shots.  
        Power-play conversions--Boston 5-1. Buffalo 7-2.
        Referee--Rob Shick.

Comments:  Shick pocketed the whistle in the third, allowing a lot of
clutching and grabbing.  Buffalo's penalty killing unit was fantastic
again.  Mogilny was checking.  Granted he missed once and instead
flung his body into the boards, but checking like this is a novel idea
to Mogilny.  The crowd was unbelievable.  I don't think I've ever
heard a crowd that loud in the Aud for a Sabres game (remember, I was
only five when they played for the cup.  I don't remember it and no
one took me to the games).  Doug Bodger, in a postgame interview,
noted that he tried to say something to Hawerchuk, but the crowd was
too loud, even though he was shouting.  It didn't seem to matter, as
most of the Sabres and even Muckler said it was great.  Yuri Khmylev
didn't seem to realize that he was the game's third star and didn't
skate out when his name was called.  Sweeney (2) and Fuhr (1) each
were out before Yuri made his appearance, sans jersey.  When asked in
an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was, he
responed yes (ok, it was through an interpreter and he said more than
that, even more than the interpreter said, but I digress).  The
interviewer seemed to think just because he doesn't speak English, he
must not understand playoffs.  Uh-huh.

On the 7th hole, I drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was

screen went completely black, with an error message in large ""Bubble""
letters that said DIVISION BY ZERO. I thought it was funny considering
I am a computer programmer, and I had never seen an error like this on
an actual video game system like Sega or Nintendo (or even Atari or

A fine 26 year history came to a close tonight, as the Minnesota North Stars, 
or Norm's Stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the Red Wings by a score of
5-3.  The Stars goals were scored by Mike McPhee and Ulf Dahlen, who netted
two including the final one in franchise history, with less than a minute to
play.

Tonight, on the air on the Stars TV telecast, announcer Al Shaver, the voice
of the North Stars, stated basically that he will not follow the team to 
Dallas.  Shaver, when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him),
""What will you do now?"" responded, ""First I'm going to get me a new pair of
slippers.  Then I'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by.""

Thank you North Stars, and thank you Al Shaver, for 26 years of Minnesota

You think that's bad?  I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from

delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here,

Not only have I not heard of the Western Business School, or the University
of Western Ontario, I've never even wondered if there WAS a western
Ontario.  And judging by the quality of the posts coming from there, I'm
still not sure that the place exists.

Perhaps I should be impressed, though, since it appears that grade school
children in that area have access to the Internet.

Well, we're almost halfway through the first round, and so far things are
good in general:

  1. The 2 teams that I hate most: Chicago and ""Basten"" are down 3 zip.
     (even though there is a possibility either can still win their
      series, yet this ego-thrashing and arrogance-smashing by the
      underdogs (St. Louis and Buffalo) is so rewarding).
  2. Montreal is at this stage in a team's life where they are not good
     enough to go all the way, yet too good to be able to get some
     (really) good draft picks... :-(
  3. Is it just me, or does anyone out there also think that this year
     the cup final should be played between 2 teams from the WALES?
  4. Is it just because they're playing Montreal that I find the diques
     arrogant ***'s, or are they really?
  5. Smythe-what???? I'm really getting sick of seeing Douggie and Wendel
     night in and night out... We should see some Canucks/Jets/Flames
     action...!
  6. Don Cherry is an ******* alright, but hey... so are our politicians...
  
ObLeafsJoke:  Q. what do you get when you cross a maple leaf and a 
                groundhog?
              A. Six more weeks of crummy hockey!

Well what do you expect...Burns was playing him with Krushelnyski
and Baumgartner...Anderson is a finisher...unless you play him with
someone to can get him the puck in a finishing position...he ain't
going to do much scoring!

	I loved the ABC coverage. The production was excellent. The appearance
was excellent. It had a sleek modern look. This was the first time I heard
Thorne & Clement & I thought they were great. My only request is to leave
Al Micheals out of this. He annoys me. 
	I'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. My guess would
be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from Feb.-April and then the 
playoffs. I envy you Canadians with your TSN & CBC. Maybe I'll get a dish
to pick up Canadian TV. How much are those things, BTW?

Yeah but Soderstrom's mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the  
average helmet-and-cage variety.  It has a certain appeal on its own

Oh yeah, how come Dino could never take the Caps out of the Patrick
Division?  He choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in

So are the Islanders, but they can still pull it out.  Vancouver has Winnipeg's
 number, so it really doesn't matter.

>Kings ""always seem to battle it out""? When? Where?

 Kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7, they never play a four or five
game serious.  There's a difference between battling it out and pulling it
out, as I take Calgary to pull it out in 7.

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Who's the mindscheme(?) behind this one -- Ted
Simmons?  As the saying goes, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  I'm 230
miles from home (during the school year) and will never be able to pick up
DVE.  At least now I can sort of make out what Mike and Steigy say through
all the static on KDKA.  This just may be enough reason for me to transfer
to Duquesne and live at home.  Who's going to announce on DVE anyway? 
Paulson and Krenn?  (Just kidding.)

YAHOOOOOOOOO!

The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec
City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.

The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game
from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have
been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall
(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning
goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.

Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.

This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.
YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Those suckers got what they deserved.

Life is just great!!!! Now if my finals would go just as well!

I asked him, and Don Cherry denies being Roger Maynard and he denies

He did concede that Roger is the best two way poster on the net today.

I think that NHLPA' 93 is the best video game available now.
of course many things could be done better, but i really appreciate that
the names of players are the real ones, no matter if it lacks some logos...
I am still playing it since November leading different teams to the finals
and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring:
Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford (4 games to two),
I played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and
the best scorer and shooter was Gilmour (116 shots if I remember well)

I AM an Ulf (and Pgh) fan, and what pisses me off about the whole Adam Graves/
Ulf Samuesson debate is that Ulf plays hard-hitting hockey (nothing wrong with 
that) while Graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).

I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers
then a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.

Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which
point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as
injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly
not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
no-no).

Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was
hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call.


>#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th

> He

Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but
hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter
wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.

The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie
McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to
K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto
retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls.

Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.

> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.

Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have
trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)

You? Nah... 

He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate
to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I""m tempted to make an
exception.

But I won't.

""They're real and they're spectacular"", the Blues shutout the Blackhawks in
consecutive playoff games. 

If the Blues sweep the Hawks on Sunday, I will launch a broom onto the ice
in the last seconds of the game. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that.""

Curtis Joseph has been the ""master of his own domain"", and the Hawks have
been shooting the puck like a bunch of ""chuckers"". Not even ""Superman"" could
play any better in goal. Joseph must have been eating his ""cereal.""

""It's like a sauna in here"" said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and
the wild crowd at the Arena.

It was ""very refreshing"" to see the Blues ""double-dip"" the Hawks.

The Hawks goons tried to ""pick"" on Hull, Janney, and Joseph but the Blues
checking line ""nipped"" those Hawks real well.

The fat ""Yoyoma"" will sing on Sunday, and the Hawks will head to the ""beach"".
The Hawks' trip back to Chicago will feel like a long ""journey from Milan
to Minsk""

Enjoy Sunday's game with some Junior Mints and wash them down with a Snapple.

Just a little fun.

To put it mildly.  As I watched the Flyers demolish Toronto last night, 4-0,
I realized that no matter how good the Leafs' #1 line may be, they'll need
one or two more decent lines to go far in the playoffs.  And, of course, a
healthy Felix Potvin.

ABC ratings were very good. I was schocked to hear that ABC's telecast
was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. National
rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. Top-29 Nielsen markets were
at 2.9. In Boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion
from local sports teams.
Quite frankly, I expected ABC's ratings to be under 2.0. But I'm happy
to be proven wrong!

Well,well...Sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote
control.:-) And if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble
upon a playoff hockey game...

ESPN picked up Detroit-Toronto game on Monday night because the only
night game in MLB was being rained out in Chicago. You have to give
ESPN credit for switching to Detroit's FOX-50 coverage and having Bill
Clement at a Pittsburgh's TV station(WATE?) for intermission analysis.
Maybe,ESPN people were giddy over perliminary over-night ABC ratings
for Sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the
Norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.
Good move,ESPN!

If I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't
all that bad a hockey player.

But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:

??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle-
ton, so I'll call this one a +.

Barry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?

Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie
roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?

Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,
Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always
seems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall
as a defensive liability?

Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?

Janney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and
a personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?

So,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who 
else (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes
out on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not
in spite of him.

BTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet 
they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:
Pittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if
these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.

In summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I
suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be
that team that Lindros didn't want to play for.

I haven't seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.

Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game.
Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away
with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.
LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.

LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.
The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.
LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.
Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.

Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won
the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.
The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored
three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.
They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by
Paul Kariya.

The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also
proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU
goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by
both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.

This year's three championships games were sold out last year in about one
month.  The Bradley Center holds approximately 17,700.

As she said, the letter is addressed to Bettman.  The post (which, though
having pretty much the same content, is an entirely different entity) was
addressed to all.  When she puts the letter in the mail I doubt it will
say ""To: All"".  I figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it
since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here.  That's an entirely 
different purpose than sending the letter to Bettman.

Unfortunately...

The ""largest computer networks in the world"" phrase is a definition of 
the Internet, not a group as a whole that she claims to represent.  As
for the business of whether or not it is large, it is large compared
to say, the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank
him for changing the names, at least to this point.  And just for my
own curiosity I thought I'd look up the ""official"" definition of large
in the dictionary.  It reads:

large - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.    
        2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.

Now I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue
or how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, 
thereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical
range of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.

>He might be impressed by the size of the list of names.

Why would he be impressed with this unless it were ""large""? 

I am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing
and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear
yourself speak.  

I personally don't know whether or not I agree with the letter.  I have
very mixed emotions about it.  I like the names as they are, and don't
think they make it that difficult to learn the game, but there might be
a shred of validity to the change.

The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but
Kevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,
7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the
comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at
3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots
on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and
LaFontaine all night.

Roster move:

Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy
scratch.

Game Summary:

Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that
woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!

The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have
been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the
first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday
when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that
he was getting bored back there...

Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After
Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards
to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead
to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed
the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and
in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his
stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the
right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and
Garry should turn down their assists :-).

The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong
and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive
struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when
Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into
the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not
a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got
a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.

Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to
give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league
didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a
good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards
the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept
missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give
the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the
fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots
were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.

Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was
disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered
a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the
season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was
Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed
Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do
it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for
next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the
end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.
He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title
the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based
on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.

He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy with
the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux
of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.
Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in
four years if there was a consensus.

The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May
took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble
getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving
throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres
blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed
across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the
top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling
through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the
race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.

Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line
and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was
all over it.

The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.
Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when
Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer
took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't
get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the
FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and
headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to
make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top
of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John
Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.

But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to
just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all
over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through
Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that
missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as
he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.
Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried
about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right
next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and
mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the
puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his
stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks
end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.

Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking
minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get
set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued
to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.
Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill
allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a
faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of
him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and
that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,
7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.

The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long
they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to
Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by
Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of
the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had
moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving
at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net
at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to
put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.

The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek
was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the
neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS
blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the
left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at
18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between
the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles...

That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.

Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the
FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in
the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he
hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.

Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood
untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under
Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,
horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange
reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they
could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade
that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria
for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...

Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS
could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,
but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck
from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across
to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net
just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,
but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing
puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.

But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive
left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate
out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew
in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at
5:24 to tie the game at 4.

Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up
in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in
the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the
line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.

Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.
The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went
after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated
to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing
through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over
the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season
for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th
of the season.

Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres
power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the
chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.

Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to
make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running 
out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.
Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left
corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found
Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the
right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton
chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48
on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,
and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the
game.

So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much
in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night
(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).
The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against
with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals
despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place
since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.

A couple misc notes:

Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to
announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.

In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,
but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.

The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma""
has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no
further tests are necessary in the near future.

Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he
expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,
he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a
role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

Aargh!

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL.
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques.
The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!

It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned
the other cheek...BASTARD!

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have
gone in.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the loss on Stewart.  The Habs had
plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but
failed to put the puck in the net.  That's what did them in.  But
Mr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.

Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)

Well, I agree that if you're going to stand in front of the net,
that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. In general, you
should expect to finish the game with some bruises. However,
there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain
and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another
player. Felix Potvin, IMO, crossed that line on Wednesday. That
two hander on Ciccarelli was way out of line. I lost a lot of
respect for Potvin because of that. It showed an immaturity. He
did not slash at Ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the
slot area (a legal position for Dino to be in). Instead, he
slashed in an attempt to injure. It was out of shear frustration. As a
Leaf supporter (just a supporter, I'm not a Leaf fan really), I
was very disappointed.

You're right in mentioning Billy Smith and Ron Hextall (at least
in his Philly days). They both crossed that same line at times and
for that reason, many fans (and players) disliked them (that's
why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about
these issues). Let's hope that Felix doesn't do that again. I'd
hate to see anyone (even Dino --- although I admit I don't like
him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but
intentional) use of the stick.

It was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious
'boarding' from behind...Trottier was given a major.
 
But Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill
as a hockey player?  If Probert smashes Gilmour's head into the
boards next week, will that diminish your assessment of Gilmour's
skills?

I think Gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him

Well Bruins fans it's playoff time again.
It looks like the B's have peaked at the right time.
Getting out of the Adams is going to be a cat fight to the end.
After what they did to Montreal and Quebec, these teams will be out for
revenge. If Neely can stay healthy, and both Bourque and Moog stay sharp,
we should get to see Neely finally take out two years of frustration 
on Ulf (I don't fight) Samuelson. I don't agree with fighting in the NHL,
but if there is one guy who deserves to be taken out good, it's him.

    The tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules.  Overtime time games
    that are not shown?  What the hell kind of shit is this?  If that would
    have happened to the Flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin
    with) while I was watching, I would have gone throught the roof!

    However, everybody is getting pissed off at ESPN, but they are not the
    ones to blame.  They have prior contracts that they just can't simply break
    whenever they want to.  The N.H.L. is to blame.  When they signed the
    deal with ESPN, they had to know of this.  They had to know shit like this
    would happen since they wouldn't have complete priority.  The N.H.L.
    should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at ESPN.  How can the
    N.H.L. do this to its fans? How dare they.  We are the ones that make the
    damn league exist and they can't even televise complete playoff games for us to
    watch!  They more I write about this, the more pissed off I get.  We must
    let the N.H.L. know that  we expect a little better than this.  If anybody
    out there knows how to go about doing this, let me and everybody else know.

    Well I had to get that off my chest and while I'm at it....

    Mario is the Michael Jordan of hockey.  All that fucker has to do is fall
    on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2.  Last night in the
    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the
    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was
    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall
    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for
    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about
    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player
    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,
    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that
    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,
    on the resulting PP and
    eventually won 4-3.  His diving/calls makes a HUGE difference in the
    outcome of a game.

    They gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking
    obvious. That is not hockey.  It allows inferior players to bring down the
level of the better players, and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.
This has pissed me off for many years now, and it has improved somewhat.
However, during the playoffs and 3rd periods, the damn refs must misplace
their balls, because they sure don't make any calls that show that they got
any.

    All agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.

TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that
Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse 
and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros
to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.
 
If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?
 
Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.  
They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away 
again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in
Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the 
franchise.
 
Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montreal
for the pick.

I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that
would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. 
Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...
Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because
his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head 
for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from 
end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by 
Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall 
for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero 
because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.

Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very 
well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over 
Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all 
those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.
Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... 

>Blaming Stewart is just an

>goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.

Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against
an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.

>Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear
>traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). 

I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. 
The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,
Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.

This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,
as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau
were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave
up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.

>Roy is paid big money to 
>play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,
when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him
for most of the season.

The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should
they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of ""Burnsian"" hockey to shut
down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the 
extra 2.

Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the
series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?
The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.

If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never
have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work
by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the
puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.

Agreed here...I'll never forget Dan Kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87
Canada Cup.  He was masterful!

And Danny Gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when I watch HNIC I
remember his voice...when I see an Al MacInnis or Al Iafrate (hey, what's with
these guys named Al who can shoot??) shot from the point I still think
""blistering blast""...THN had a tribute to Gallivan in the issue following his
death; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  It
went: 

""It appears Risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check,"" he said, ""and 
will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition.""

Classic, vintage Gallivan!  He's sorely missed.  So here's to two of the best
there was and best that ever will be.

Not to Sutter bash or anything since I idolized them as players....
you sure would think the Sutters would learn something about burning out their
teams in the regular season.....just too much intensity during the regular 
season.  I earlier posted a note about Brian and got to thinking after I read
this item.....gee both Sutters won their divisions and now both have lost 
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs.  Kind of makes you wonder.......

Bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the WartHawks!!!!!
Agreed Jim.....this has been damn sweet, so far.  About the only thing
that comes close to this is shutting up all the Maple Laugh fans....Detroit
has completely kicked their asses so far.  But, I will stick with the
Blues for providing the best playoff tonic so far.

At the Lester Patrick Awards lunch, Bill Torrey mentioned that one of his

working for him.  At the same dinner, Clarke said that his worst mistake
in Philadelphia was letting Mike Keenan go -- in retrospect, almost all
players came realize that Keenan knew what it took to win.  Rumours are
now circulating that Keenan will be back with the Flyers.

Nick Polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the

Gerry Meehan and John Muckler are worried over the Sabres' prospects;
Assistant Don Lever says that the Sabres have to get their share now,
because a Quebec dynasty is emerging ...

The Mighty Ducks have declared that they will not throw money around

Oilers coach Ted Green remarked that ""There some guys around who can

Senators' Andrew McBain told off a security guard at Chicago Stadium
who warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room; McBain

So if Potvin can pound on Dino, what happens when Dino pounds 
on him?  If Dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash Potvin
in return?  This year at a UM-LSSU hockey game, a UM player
was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with
his stick.  Is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles
isn't?  How do the refs know what to call?  Do the goalies

The last name is Niedermayer, as in New Jersey's Scott's last name, because
(you guessed it) they are brothers.  But Rob Niedermayer is a center, not
a defenseman.

I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya.  They aren't saying much, but
they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  Chris
Pronger's name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that they'll take
Niedermayer.  They may take Pronger, except that they already have too many
defensive prospects.

     Well now the Sabres are up 3 - 0 in games, and its to
     bad that Boston isn't putting up more of a fight as
     that could have been the best series of the playoffs,
     I think Boston will come out smoking in the next
     two games and that Buffalo will end the series in
     game six back in Buffalo, and say, how about those Islanders?
     they are up 2 - 1 on the Capitals and will probably
     win the series, only to be clobbered by the Penguins who
     should eliminate the Devils in the next game.
     I cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the 
     Penguins this year (again) and they will take cup # 3 
     I'm afraid.  well talk to ya later.

I applauded the Sabres for making the deal to get Fuhr, specifically because I
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series.  However, I don't
think the Leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that Felix
won't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.  

Anyway, does anybody else find it ironic that Fuhr is up against Moog? (or at
least he was until a guy named Alex showed up....:-) )

How exactly would Ferreira accomplished this?  The three-headed GM-ship has
taken a lot of heat, but nobody's explained how things would have been any
different had Ferreira still been there.  Would Ferreira have made more
trades?  Who would have he had traded?  Would he have made fewer trades?
Who should not have been traded?

You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling works.  ESPN had
prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had
contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal
was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this
one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the
season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by
squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota
game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball
telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
night).

But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They
must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something
to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of
contract with baseball.

So relax.  I'm happy.  (I don't get SportsChannel anyway).

	There was apparently a 30 minute special here on the Penguins' 
season on ABC (WTAE - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening 
game against the Devils on Sunday.  I only turned it on in time to 
watch the credits.  If anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow 
it to dub it, I would appreciate it.  I would be willing to come pick 
it up, and I'll return it the next day and buy you a beer.  Please

According to this morning's Post-Gazette:

The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates
are playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by 
WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's
game.

In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship
station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems
more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be 
simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the 
early round playoff games, will be available by ""subscription tv"" only.
To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and
then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.

Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv 
simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio
broadcast team.  

No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the
end of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said he'd like to hire
Lange and Steigerwald.

I've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks.  I got my first when I was 15
(a Christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years 
later.  I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, 
and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid 
off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, 
but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for 
dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my 
experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, 
but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.

I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench 
if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to 
impale yourself on it :-)

I'm in Edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least OFTEN) the case,
here we were ""treated"" to the actual ABC telecast of the Kings/Flames
game.  I'm with whoever said it earlier - Don Witless (er, Whitman) is
a poor commentator, and not just for hockey.  Normally, if the Oilers
were still playing (augh), I would turn off the sound and listen to 
the radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing.

Ah yes.  California.  Did the San Francisco Bay area media report that
Joe Montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired
San Jose Sharks coach George Kingston?  Apparently Montana is not only
coveted for his winning attitude, but as a playing coach he will be
expected to quarterback the powerplay.

 Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring
 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games.

 As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's
 playoffs, since the World Championships starts April 18th.

 But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next
 season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg
 and Naslund, so the latest news on this is that MoDo is looking for
 personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind
 of money they would receive in NHL.

 Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two
 spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and
 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late
 stage of the tournament. Technically, I seem to recall that you can leave
 spots open until 24 hrs before the WC final.

I'm glad Grant Fuhr will never be as over-confident after two wins
as you are...it takes four wins to defeat an opponent...each tougher

Fuhr is proving the Fuhr-bashers wrong, but Boston is an awfully

KDKA has first rights to Pirates games, and will split probably 50-50

Is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad??  I
can't remember how many times during the Penguins-Devils game they showed some
guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being
fired on goal.  In fact, I think they even missed one goal completely because
they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner.

Now the last time I watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going
at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . . 

Is it just me??

1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.
-------------------------------------------------
Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93

The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against
the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of
a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-
standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record
their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on
penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play 
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had
their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10
tries.

The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the
blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-
pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to 
the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this 
morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.

1st period: 
1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the
far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He
put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up
in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the 
hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.

Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings
failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.
Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30
second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in
the period.

2nd period: 
The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed
to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game.

1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the
puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit 
the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated 
down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and
skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him 
and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.

2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.
Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot 
where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson
came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.

3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off
the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,
beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.

4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his
own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.

Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at
12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they
failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive
power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high
sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The
Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.

3rd period:
The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident here
in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.

5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,
wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the
crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net
where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.

Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.

5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net
and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the 
crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.

Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury
tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where 
Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing 
a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the 
Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 
8:19) took penalties.  

5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near 
point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the
net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.

6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone 
cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed 
the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, 
beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.

At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he
went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames
right out of the game.

On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey
as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing.

On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or
the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.

Notes:
------
The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.

Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.

The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving
the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon 
games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play
over their last 9 games.

The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than
those of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after
him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they
were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.
Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution

What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He
originated the phrase ""if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat
'em on the ice.""  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,
that Don Cherry is a classy individual?

The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and
that is: ""it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice""

Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have
always thought that this was nonsense.

Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it
at a game in Boston.  

It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The ""Golden Triangle""
(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along
with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the 
other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens
logo, and a space for the ""new"" (now current) logo.

Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it
for him.  

But while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The
very next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask
done in by a goalie's superstition.

    I remember reading an article in Reader's digest many moons ago
 about a similar incident. During a minor leaque game a player neck was
 cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes
 flew up. In this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since
 his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the
 usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. A quick        
 thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
 snow to contract the blood vessels (from what I can remember).

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years -- nervous.

For the Leafs sake, I hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game 2.  If game 1 is indicative of the series, it's gonna go
quick.

Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC
and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.
When/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes
through, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their
original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV
contract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the
Prism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's,
another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals
like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this
cross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this 
season!!

Here in Nanaimo (on Vancouver Island, for you furriners out there) we
got the ABC coverage on KOMO.  It probably depends on your cable company.

I started off switching between the CBC and ABC broadcasts, but finally
settled on ABC.  I can't stand Don Whitman, and Al Michaels was doing a
decent job.  He followed the play pretty well, knew all the players'
names, and only made a couple of ""rookie"" mistakes that I noticed.
One thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain
the offside rule.

Am-I-paranoid-or-is-this-really-happening department:
There were no fights in the game, but there were a couple of occasions
where it looked like a fight was about to start.  Both times ABC cut
away to show a closeup of a coach or McNall or something.  Has ABC
decided to adopt the ""Spicer policy?""

Actually, the way I understand it, it is an octapus.
Apparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on
the ice and the announcer said ""Octapi will not occupy the ice""
or something like that, and it's happened ever since.  The fans
cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points.
+/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull,
John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.

Given the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can
inflate his totals.

Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 21, 1993.
The game being broadcast in my region was LA and Calgary, although
I think it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night.

(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)

Topics
------

Don's Tie, Grant Fuhr, Penalties, Wings vs Leafs, Fighting, Dale Hunter.

Episode Summary
---------------

This episode began with the camera zoomed in on Don's tie. Don was
pointing out the characters on the tie... Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn,
and Yosemite Sam (who Don called Lanny Macdonald.)

Ron Maclean began by mentioning that Don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous night's games, because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of Hunter
and Fuhr.

Don began to praise Fuhr, calling him the ""greatest goalie"", and
said that he's winning the series against Boston all by himself.
He then showed clips from earlier episodes (Nov. 14, Jan. 16) when
Fuhr was still with the Leafs, and Don advised ""Don't Trade Fuhr!""

Don went on to predict that if Buffalo gets by Boston, it would
be Fuhr who wins the series. Muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade, but Don feels Muckler's been vindicated.

The next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls. He showed a clip from a Winnipeg-Vancouver
game, where Domi hit a Vancouver player, and was given a 2 min. penalty.
Ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved,
but Don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit, with Domi
hitting the Vancouver player with his shoulder. Don: ""Its sad what
they're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.""

Next, they went to the playoff series between Detroit and Toronto.
People in Detroit were calling Wendel Clarke ""Wendy"" for not fighting.
However, Don pointed out that Probert was not fighting either.

This lead Don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork, and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking: ""It's like college
hockey... The little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.
That's why you're seeing so much stickwork. Because they know you
won't drop your gloves and give them a shot. The rules are made
by people who don't know what's going on in hockey"".

The final topic Don discussed was Dale Hunter. Don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals, and showed a clip
of Hunter from a previous game. When he was younger, Hunter was
taught to ""play to win"", which differs from today's idea of
just letting kids have fun.

At then end of the episode, they showed a clip from a coach's
corner, with the tape on fast forward, so that Don sounded like
one of the chipmunks.

Rating
------
Typical anti-fighting posturing, not too much humour, but some
good quotes.

I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

He's a Canadian ""thing"". Former coach of the Boston Bruins and Colorado
Rockies. From the summaries that get posted I gather that his ongoing beef
this year has been the conventional wisdom that Canadian hockey is doomed
to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the U.S.

After he left the Rockies, he got a job with CBC's Hockey Night in Canada
and hasn't looked back since. Actually, he did work for CBC at least

I'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. The closest
thing you'll find to Cherry in the U.S. is Stan Fischler, a self-described
hockey maven. The similarities are that they both say things that get
people upset. The difference is that Cherry knows the game and Fischler
doesn't.

>ass.  Let me know - maybe I'm missing something.

Don's a character. If he were completely rational and noncontroversial
he wouldn't have a job. By some definitions, he could be called an ass.
But then some people feel the same about Mike Lang, another character that
I wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).

In *your* case, that bias is acceptable :-)... Mine shows with the Norris pick,
so we're even...

I'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did, but my pick would be 
Al Arbour.  Not too many folks thought the Isles would be in the playoffs, let 
alone contend for 3rd in their division... Granted that they *did* have a little
help from their cousins on Broadway... :-)

And I like the Islanders about as much as I like mowing my lawn...

	Finns had to do their best last night when they played against Norway
in world champs. After two periods the score was still 0-0. This game was 
quite much similar to the first game Finland played  (against France).
The norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. In the third period
Juha Riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.
The second goal was scored by Kari Harila, who shot straight from a faceoff
behind the Nowwegian goalie. Saku Koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first
point of this tournament. Saku Koivu played very well througout the game and he
was awarded the best player of the game- prize. Despite the fact that he is
quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. 
I think that we will hear from this guy in the future.

I think that Mike Foligno was the captain of the Sabres when he
got traded to the Leafs. Also, wasn't Rick Vaive the captain of
the Leafs when he got traded to Chicago (with Steve Thomas for
Ed Olcyzk and someone). Speaking of the Leafs, I believe that
Darryl Sittler was their captain (he'd torn the ""C"" off his
jersey but I think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he
was traded to the Flyers.

Oh yeah, of course, Gretzky was the captain of the Oilers before
he was traded wasn't he?

Brad McCrimmon was the captain of the Flames when he was traded to Detroit
following the 1989-90 season. This was during the off-season though.

There's countless examples of captains being traded, I'm sure.

Her sole purpose in mentioning the net, as Steve Gallichio has already 
pointed out, is to lend weight to her points through association with the
internet.  There is no other reason to mention the internet.  This is 
misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation Alison

This is not a letter.  It is a petition claiming to represent a large
proportion of rec.sport.hockey users, and by implication, a significant
number of internet users.  65 names can in no way be considered a 
""large"" proportion of rec.sport.hockey which, while we have no way of
counting actual readership, is accessible to hundreds of thousands of
people.  65 persons is no more than a fly's fart in a windstorm.

Gee.  You looked up ""large"" in the dictionary?  What next?  Two syllable

Let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of 
65 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your IQ scores.

>>He might be impressed by the size of the list of names.

>Why would he be impressed with this unless it were ""large""? 

As I said, he *might* be impressed by the size of the list of names.  But 
it would have to be considerably larger.  But even this definition does
not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence.

The back actually has a Bee followed by a Z to represent the Beezer. It

The biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the
availability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000
and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,
British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There
are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here
it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? He's from
California."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,
a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio
play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were
the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was
on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational
hockey for about 35 years.

Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for
the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,
cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club
dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues
cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.

By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""
areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an
industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther
King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west
of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.
Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive
to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them
give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee.

I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that!
While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I
still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would
now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.
In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres
the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of
huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. 
Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to
indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been
for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)
through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open
up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on
a breakaway to salt away the game).  There
is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the
victory. 

In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as
LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev
(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense
, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton
playing a regular shift afterall ;-)
The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

Anyone interested in catching the games from Nassau

the game at North Carolina's Original Sports Bar in
Chapel Hill.  I'm pretty sure they carry HTS as well.
They had all three games on at the same

Roberts played in last night game against the Sharks and got a goal (38th)

This definitely bolsters Calgary's chances in the playoffs.

	I can't believe that the NY Rangers would force its 
players to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead
of letting them represent their countries in the World Championships.

Anderrson and Zubov are waiting for the NHL to make a decision to this,
while Kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors.

The Rangers are a disgrace.

But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before.  I can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's
obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's
at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.

Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA
game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.
Wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game?

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
from being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their
number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering
the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  That is
why they are not Selke candidates.

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you
ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

Who are these pundits??  Gilmour was good with St Louis- but he was not the
best two-way player in the game when he was with them.  You have overhyped
Gilmour on this net for months.  He is a very good forward- but hardly the
best in the NHL.

What?! White, yes. Well off, definitely not. Hockey season ticket owners have
the lowest average income of any of the four major North American sports.

And think of where the majority of hockey players come from. From a farm out
in Boondock, Saskatchewan or Weedville, Alberta.

The inner city isn't the only place that is poor.
I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.

Chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter.
However, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts.  The score was 4-0 I think when the goal you mentioned
was scored.  In the third period when it looked like Toronto was coming
back, Chevy was exceptional.  I can see him as a Barraso style playoff
goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line,
but comes up big when really needed.  I guess we'll both find out.

In the game *I* have seen yesterday in the Olympiahalle of Munich
Canada won 4-1 against Sweden! The last goal for Canada was at 19:59 in
the 3rd period. Maybe you shouldn't go and get you another beer 
before the game is over and then post imaginary results...

-
- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement

- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to
- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.
-
- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,
- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.
-
- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly
- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market

- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans

  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the
Opposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The
government said that Pock is going nowhere!

  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be
Tory leader 9 years ago?

Hmmm...I also heard through the grapevine that Team Finland might try and
leave a spot open for at least one NHLer. (Some guy named Sel{nne, ever

Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it,
the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.

This is good, IMO.  There's no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold.

Come on Boston, where the hell are you? Seven wins in a row and what, choke?

I'd much rather see the Bruins in the Wales Conference finals vs. Pitt than
Buffalo or Quebec, if only because it would be more interesting.  Not that
Buffalo or Quebec can't put up a good fight, but I'd much more enjoy a 7-0
pasteing of the Bruins than the Devils.  You have to feel for Terrerri(sp?).

Ah, well, maybe the Devils will pull it out, or maybe the Pens will lose in
the second round, but if not, I hope the Bruins are there to meet them.

I re-read what I wrote and it didn't say exactly what I thought.  

Sure the Pens are a better team.  They've got size and the best skill players
in the league.  They've also got the best clutch goaltending.  They're the 
best team in the league.

But, my point was the Caps have not played to their ability level vs the
Pens since last year's choke.  And that's the mental problem (the one they've
had for a number of years) I tried to point out.  Spirit, mental preparedness,
will to win, whatever you want to call it, it's missing when the Caps play the
Pens.  Actually, you're right - it won't make any difference.

Subject: Canucks 3-2 over Winnipeg
Organization: Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada
Lines: 51

	The Jets gave the Canucks another run for their money in an almost
identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as
Vancouver outscored Winnipeg 3-2.
	The pattern of the first game was repeated tonight, with the Canucks
scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period, only to stave
off a Jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. The Jets
looked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the 
numbers that counted: goals.
	Vancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and
left winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to 
boost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of
Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent
in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.
	However, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the
game to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,
checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged
by a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. 
	The hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught
Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make
the score 2-1. 
	Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush
to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do 
anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were
allowed to set up and make plays.
	Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.
McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne
while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous
on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck
zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four
checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.
	A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period
resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The
Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's
legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.
	The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.
This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected
or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight
Winnipeg defence that were never supported.
	However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive
lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff
in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with
no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the
game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a 
backhand even though he was off balance. 
	By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it
to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing
for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2.
	Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.

forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net
goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din
""Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!""  It sounds stupid, but that
early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then

I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on
another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses 
where the administration or the athletics department wants to 
eliminate the women's ice hockey team.

 Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex Discrimination Ruling: Brown University
Ordered to Restore Two Women's Varsity Teams
To: National Desk, Sports Writer
 Contact: Lynette Labinger, 401-421-9794, home 401-274-7507, or
          Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For
          Public Justice

   WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court
order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its women's
gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling in
Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision
in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest
law firm representing the women athletes.
   ""This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a
school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of
opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate men's teams,""
said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.
   The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that
prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions
receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two women's teams as
university-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to
compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for
uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also
been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.
   ""This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,""
said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providence's Roney &
Labinger.  ""Universities across America need to reevaluate their
programs quickly. Title IX is the law and it's going to be enforced.""
   Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State
University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate
University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders
requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women's varsity
teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is
representing women athletes at IUP.
   In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJ's legal team included:
Ray Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca
& Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The
National Women's Law Center, Women's Sports Foundation, and National
Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in
support of TLPJ's appeal.

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.

>Another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from

Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how 
""transferable"" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used?

I am interested in seeing each method.
But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.

At least last night there was some excitement. The Pens

the previous two games. I'm not sure if NJ just rose up and 
played better or if the Penguins just started to play down 
somewhat. Probably it was somewhere in between. New Jersey

 I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better
 it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.

 Some other reasons why the ""worse"" teams are so tough to beat was presented
 by Hans ""Virus"" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).

 1) The ""worse"" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)
    have now usually world class goalies.

 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much
    less unnecessary penalties.

 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them ""run out of gas.""

 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

 Another weird thing was that the Czechs played entertaining hockey..
 err.. just kidding, David.

 Alex? That's a new name for me ;)

 OK, I forgot the Czech roster at home yesterday, but now I have it.
 I don't know the teams for all players, so I would appreciate if
 you guys could fill in the blanks for me (especially I think some
 of these players play in Finland).

No, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.

That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame-
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average
european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better 
skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL
are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league
game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many 
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen.

I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars
aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans
are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the
class of his own).

I saw a mask once that had drawings of band-aids, presumably for every puck
that goalie stopped with his face/head.  I can't remember who it was or even
if it was NHL (I see quite a few AHL games here).

This is by far the funniest mask I've seen, and for me funny=cool

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive
site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

Here are the team goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those
are not verified.  

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

Did your boyfriend comment on the fact that Clement looks like a

DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. 

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city.

The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold
1400 for this year.

SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL
The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of
Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200
Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion
frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.

CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE
Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore
Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,
announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.
There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced
a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players
including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited
farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.

It's called 'contractual obligations' with Major League Baseball.
I would've liked to see the OT of the Isles-Caps game, but I understand
where ESPN is coming from. ESPN is committed to a single telecast a night
and everything after that is a bonus.

Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.  There
are unofficially 52 entrants.  Here are the stats on what teams were
picked to win it all:

Pittsburgh:	34 (1 sweep, 14 in 5, 15 in 6, 4 in 7)
Boston:		6  (1 in 5, 5 in 6)
Detroit:	4  (3 in 6, 1 in 7)
Montreal:	2  (1 in 5, 1 in 7)
Toronto:	2  (1 in 6, 1 in 7)
   (no, this wasn't Roger)
Calgary:	1  (in 6)
Quebec:		1  (in 6)
Vancouver:	1  (in 7)
Washington:	1  (in 6)

Why the hell hasn't anybody picked Chicago???  NOBODY!  Quebec got a pick,
Detroit got 4, but absolutely no Chicago!  How odd.

Here are the ""losers"":

Detroit:	20
Chicago:	16	(so there they are!)
Pittsburgh:	6
Vancouver:	4
Boston:		2
Calgary:	2
Los Angeles:	1	what?!?
Toronto:	1

LOS ANGELES???????  Are you out of your mind?!?!?  Good luck to you,
you'll need it!

So Pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the Stanley Cup.  They'll
statistically beat Detroit in 6 games.  HAHA  that's happening!  NOT!  As
I said, every one of my picks will come true, and I picked Chicago to lose
to Pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket Detroit.  
Well, tough luck to all of ya!  I am a genius!!!  ;-)

Wow, this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team, Boston.
Which Sweeney you ask...well, of course Bob Sweeney, the one that Boston
let Buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 Sweeneys which makes things
slightly confusing).  Game winner in OT in game 1, and another
BIG goal (seconds after Fuhr made 3 point blank saves -> this is why
Grant has 5 rings!!!) to put Buffalo ahead in the 3rd.  Yes, Neely countered
a minute later, but hadn't this course of Buffalo going ahead after being
tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities, I
think Boston would have notched their first win of the series.

Well, the Sabres haven't made it to the end of this series yet, but
I certainly feel they've got Boston right were they want them...actually,
they've got them in a position that neither Buffalo nor Boston felt
that would come about.  One more astronomical game by Fuhr, a few more
heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and I
think Borque, Neely, Jouneau (sp?), and Company are gonna be swinging
a new stick (Weather is perfect for golf season) real soon.  I'm not
gonna waiger anything on this, because I've seen some really strange
things happen in both pro and college hockey.

Talking about golf...was that a hockey swing, golf swing or baseball
swing that Hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that Khmylev
deflected in for the BIG ONE?  The whole OT (all 1 minute of it!) was a
tesiment to Buffalo's ability to really be persistent and grind it out
in the end (something they weren't necessarily in the regular season).  The
Sabres pushed hard and forced Borque to blatently take down Bodger in
the opening seconds.  I don't normally like penalties being called in
such ultra-critical points, but this was BLATENT.  Finally, the Sabres
won a faceoff (they weren't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)
when LaFontaine scooped at the puck 3 times.  When Hawerchuck took his
shot (quite a boomer, but Blue stopped this one) he took a few steps
over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again, without setting
it up.  I didn't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming,
""They score, THEY SCORE!!!"".  The best was seeing LaFontaine jumping
up and down, skating a little bit, jumping some more, and then skating
over to Brad May who he jumped on.

What about including points?  Probably no goals (at least against
opponents) but there have been several assists given.

But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...
Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
initiative (within the limits of his system)...while Roger
has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why Messier will
be able to and has played for Keenan, but thought Roger's way
was a sure loser.

Roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad
blood between Nielson and Messier, it would be a mistake to bring
him back even in that role.

True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!

Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from
Montreal.

Montreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)

I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great
GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you
gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-
that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better 
than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original
post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not
the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:

>and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
>enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.

I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here
which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for 
us to say, ""He should hire a different coach.""  In fact, he has talked about
doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so
built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of
the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to 
prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second
round.  He needs to, as the papers say, ""get that monkey off his back.""
So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all
a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down
from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will
improve as a result.

I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how
good of a GM he really is.

>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM
>so none of this is true anyway.

I may not agree with everything you've said, but it's been fun discussing
it with you.

Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But
the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the
last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than 
$50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Pettit gambled and lost. Now he'll have to pay more.

All these people who send in their polls should take a closer look at
NJD, they are a very deep team, with two very capable goalies, and
excellent forwards and defensemen.  Shooter in Richer, an all around do
it all in Todd, chef Stasny-master of a thousand dishes, power play
captain-Stevens.  Take a look at the numbers, or play with them and see

Why should we pay your predictions any heed, considering
you couldn't even predict the proper matchups?  Maybe
you should try forecasting the weather instead.

Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge?
A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt.
He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios, I 
wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade.
I also wish we still had Corson.

Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the 
bench.

Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have
no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with
Carbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous
Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front
most of the time.

Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique
gets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10"", 172)
getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3"", 205) with no reply
from the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard 
threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked
Sundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's
big trouble someplace...

>Hextall made some good saves but
>really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3
>& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd.

Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third 
period at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the
period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made 
the saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.

Domi got tossed in the 2nd with a high-sticking major.  He had been
playing with Kris King and Stu Barnes...and it was this line that was
arguably the best in the first two games.

You can't be serious!  I and many of my colleagues have not received any
bad e-mails from Roger, in fact, Roger happens to have answered most if not
all of my hockey questions and curiosities, so before you start flaming
at me or Roger, better re-consider your nasty attitude towards Roger and the

Smythe Division
---------------

Vancouver vs. Winnipeg - Jets in 7
The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games.  Everyone is
healthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :)

Calgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6
From what I have seen, the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see
them getting by the Flames.

Final- Jets in 6.
The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a
close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I
don't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough.

Norris Division
---------------

Chicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota
Chicago in 6 against the Blues, 7 against the Stars.  

Detroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.
The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is
more experienced than Potvin.

Final - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.
Belfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.

Conference Final - Hawks in 6.  It hurts, but the Hawks are more experienced,
and that will carry them through to the final.

Prince of Wales Conference
--------------------------

Adams Division
--------------

Boston vs. Buffalo - Bruins in 6.
B's can check, Juneau is darn good, and Neely.  The Sabres rely too much
on Lafontaine and Mogilny.

Quebec vs. Montreal - Montreal in 7.
Classic battle, the inexperience will hurt the Nords, this year.

Final - Bruins in 5.  Habs will be hurting from their series with the Nords,
and Boston has been able to control the scorers on the Habs.

Patrick Division
----------------

Pittsburgh vs Islanders/Devils - Pens in 5.
One word.  Mario.

Washington vs. Devils/Islanders - Caps in 6 / Devils in 7.
I think the Caps can beat the Isles, but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been
strong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team.
It doesn't matter, though.

Final - Pens in 5.  Two more words.  Stevens.  Jagr.

Cup Final - Pens in 6.  Three last words.  Tocchet.  Murphy.  Barrasso.

The only thing I don't like about this is that the Pens woofers are going to
be out in full force again.  (I don't mean the regular Penguin fans...it's
just like the bunch around here that if these predictions are true will post
like nuts while the Jets are winning, but we won't hear from again when they
lose.)

(Oh yeah...next year's Cup prediction...Jets in 7 over the Nords.)

Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and
his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
forget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.

Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't
jinxed him.

I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you
asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in
the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?
What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The
naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary
obfuscation.

Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.
The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did
was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-
olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-
er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-
bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe
and his pals showed up.

What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better
defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that
Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby
Orr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll
and find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have
to, do you?

So you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember

And of course you neatly deleted Jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the
game  losing  its  ""Canadianization"".   Quoting me out of context does
more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is
clearly  progressive  and  is anything but ""biased, closed minded, ig-

How can you assume it was a sarcastic remark?

For someone whose first language is not English, I would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes Pat is the MVP on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players.  Quite modest I might say.

  Did anyone see the Montreal - Quebec game yesterday?  It was tight right down
to the last second of the third period.  In the overtime Roy and Hextall played
like they were gods.
  Ok, so Montreal won!  They deserved it after getting their first goal in
overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  Their second
goal in overtime was also replayed, but I could not tell if it was the Montreal
player who kicked it in.  The puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.
Anyways, Montreal is back into the series.

I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show
the shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned
back to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more 
experienced.

The Rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off
Messier and the first line.  Nemchinov is a perfect third line center.

This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're
going to play  havoc with the schedule, you should  at least make sure that
Prime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the
post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within
one minute or so of the game  ending.

As for the earlier comments about CBC being ""Ontariocentric"" frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see
the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The
reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in  one night.

 As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.

Us easterners who have newspapers with editors
unsympathetic to playoff pools, often don't get
summaries from west coast games since they
finish too late at night for the morning edition.

I (and I'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate
it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games
could be posted to this group right away.
basically, all we need are goal scorers and assists,
don't bother with times, penalties, shots etc...

this would make a lot of pool-obsessed people very
happy.

I guess with the Senators out golfing now, the 
local papers have lost interest.  ;-)

thanks.

The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach
era, when Darryl Sittler was called a ""cancer on the team"", he tore the
C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.

Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly
captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,
Sittler got traded to Detroit.

Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and
they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.

During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss
the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad
Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried
to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.

The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late
of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably
one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of
playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-
came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a
captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the
players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making
sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.

I think Joe Kocus should play every night.   He is a big physical guy, and  
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits.  (both checks and  
fists)  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going.  Plus, he helps  
protect the other players.  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
on the ice unless he is it.  I have seen people start to go after essa  
Tikkanen, only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in.  I think he is big  
asset, but should be third line, and special situation only play.

Ok guys, I need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the
last 25 games.  Doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  I'm
about to enter a playoff pool and I want to know who is hot going into
the playoffs.  Don't need to mention Pittsburgh.  They can't get any hotter
than they are now.


P.S. I need this by Sunday

Do the Isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides
Pilon??? Once again, last night's STUPID penalty put the Isles in a hole for the
remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! Even though the Isles
nearly survived Pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time
for a 5-minute major penalty. Instead of confronting Cote as he came across the
blueline, Pilon backed up and swiped at Cote's nose with his stick. Al Arbour
can't be serious to think Pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on
the line??? I heard Scott LaChance is out till later in the series, but there
must be someone else!!! Bring back the BAMMER, Dave Langevin!!!!

The only way to change ESPN's thinking, if it is even possible, is to complain
to them directly.  Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  

I do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply
change the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when
they didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted
to watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra
inning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's
morning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.

My wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!

It is no matter what you call the teams, Jokerit and TPS, or Helsinki Tornado
and Turku Typhoon, the best palyers in Finland would eventually end up in
those teams anyway, if they were in the ""big"" league.

Unrealistic for now. Maybe we should first just expand Finnish league to
allow teams from Baltic countries to entry!  Then others will get interested
in the idea, that maybe one should settle something bigger. The ultimate 
goal, as you want it, would be European Division in NHL. Btw. does that 
make a final with an Europan team against Norht American?

Subject: Playoff consecutive loss record?
Lines: 20

With the recent demise of the Chicago Blawkhawks (much to my delight) I
noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the Pens last year, and
now 4 to the Blues) and I am wondering what the NHL record for consecutive
losses is, if there even is one...

I'm pretty sure that the Hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since
they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that
was)

Basically, I need something else to rag on my Hawks-fan friend with :)

Mike, the insomniaced

I have to disagree with you on this one.  It is anything BUT common.  In the
4 or 5 years I have been watching hockey I have NEVER seen this happen EVER.

I am not sure what league you have been watching.  :-)

Anyone else agree with this?

This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving
ESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake.

But returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next
time, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really
compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.

It is a long standing good luck Redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
on the ice during a Stanley Cup game. They say it dates back to '52
at the Olympia when the Wings became the 1st team (I think) to sweep 
the cup in 8 games. A lot hardet to throw one from Joe Louis seats
than from the old Olympia balcony, though.

Funniest I ever saw was when some Tiger fans threw one on the field
during a Detroit/Toronto baseball game ...  I was living in California
and the folks I was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
incredulous when I recognized the octopus BEFORE the camera closeup !!

Hi guys....

What happened?
	1.  Potvin didn't let six goals by.
	2.  Wendel and Andreychuk woke up.
	3.  Home ice and LOTS of yelling in the Gardens gave the Leafs
		the emotional edge.
	4.  Refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour Leafs.

	A couple of comments:

	1.  On Gilmour:  Just because the guy isn't one of the three
	stars doesn't mean he was not leading the team.  Someone posted
	the playoff point total and he's in something like fifth or sixth
	place....plus, he walked away with the Molson cup (given for
	accumulating points from the three star selection) during the
	regular season.

	2.  On the officiating:  I've heard gripes from both ends on this
	one.  Emotions are very high in this series;  the rivalry is
	one of the stronger ones I know of.  I do have to agree that the
	officiating last night was pro-Leaf in general (except for whoever
	missed that slash on Gilmour's hand).

	3.  In general:  I STILL think Detroit has one of the better
	chances vs. Pittsburgh (though I think the Leafs would do better
	against the Blues....but not as well if they made it out of the
	division). Problem is, I like both these teams, though I'm
	supporting the Leafs on the underdog principle.  D

	By the way...Gilmour tiring out is a lot like Bob Probert not
		playing aggressive hockey....
	By the way....I'm not any sort of expert, nor do I claim to be.
		I just like watching a good matchup.


	tee hee hee...ooops!

Pure and Simple, Grant Fuhr is money.  He has been awesome in the playoffs,
especially last night.  But Mogilny has been scoring well, and his russian
friend Kymlev (sp?) has also done well.  But Fuhr is the biggest reason they
are winning, and the difference between this year's team and previous years.

I just overheard that San Jose Coach George Kingston was officially
terminated today...  Maybe good news, maybe bad.  I kinda liked him, but he
seemed to lack a certain fire.

Subject: Sabres!!! Sweep.
Organization: Carleton University
Lines: 18

It's over - the Sabres came back to beat the Bruins in OT 6-5 tonight
to sweep the series. A beautiful goal by Brad May (Lafontaine set him
up while lying down on the ice) ended it. Fuhr left the game game with
an injured shoulder and Lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the
Sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.

Montreal edged Quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be
headed for Game 7. The Habs dominated the first two periods and were
unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. However, an early
goal by Brunet in the 3rd won it.

The Islanders won their 3rd OT game of the series on a goal by Ray
Ferraro 4-3; the Caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the
2nd. The Isles' all-time playoff OT record is now 28-7.

IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at 
this time. Johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his 
group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in 
Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. 
(Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the 
change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this 
year, a tougher Bowman keeps the egos in check. Johnson on the 
other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players 
to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both 
of which came at exactly the right time. 

Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach 
for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can 
you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? 
Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also 
keeps the egos in check. 

Just a couple of ideas.

Rob Niedermayer is a forward (center, I think) with the WHL Medicine Hat
Tigers.  His brother, Scott, is a defenseman (now with the NJ Devils).

ESPN has been trying various things to get away from the
follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  One of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
to be shown between plays.

The problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,
other times you get burned.

Does anyone know if there will be alternate games in cities where local
broadcast rights are being protected?  I'd really love to see the Bruins a
couple times, and with this pro-Patrick bias shown by ESPN something tells me
that I will have to wait until the conference finals to see them :-}.

According to ""Quotations from Chairman Cherry"", Don was playing in
Springfield. He and another player had to pay some fines; the other
player had his paid off, but not Don didn't want to.

Don called the other player a ""teacher's Pet"", and the other player
replied ""Ah, that's just sour grapes"".

Don't know how accurate that is, but that's what's printed.

Two things:

1. Didn't the trade deadline pass two weeks ago?

2. The FLYERS would never ever EVER give up Lindros, simple as that.

Lloyd Pettit married into Allen-Bradley Corp. (ab.com) family and owns the

Center.

This is not the way I have heard it.  See, Lloyd (as he is affectionately
referred to by Milwaukeeans and Bob Uecker) bought the Bradley Center *TO* get
the NHL to come here.

Yeah, the Bucks, the Milwaukee Wave (soccer), the Admirals, the Marquette
Warriors, concerts and a bunch of other things...

And Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never
will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. 

The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his
arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the
head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right
between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.

The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then
he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)

Detroit's going to beat Toronto in 6 or LESS!!!

 Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux... Just
Look at what Gilmour did for Toronto.  When you think of Toronto,
who comes to mind, Gilmour, Andreychuk, Potvin...ah...did I mentio
n Gilmour?

Back to Detroit...  There really isn't a team that could stand up
to them if all the players on the team play to their potential,
no one could stop them.  Yzerman, Fedorov, Coffey, Lindstrom...
there's more firepower there than Pittsburgh... and they don't tri

end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly Flyers.
The Flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on Keenans decision, because
they were very interested in him.  Oh well.

Not in Indiana:  they showed a tape-delay of Chicago v Boston, because
WGN had the rainout of the cubs.  So WGN showed reruns of Hitchcock.
No hockey (at least in this part of the state).

I watched the game Germany-Czechs in WC today...and i was astonished about
the behaviour of the German audience!
The German team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went
grazy! They threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is
that stupid or what?? I guess the Canadian referee (one of the
Isostar-bros ;) gave the German team a penalty for that, but it didn't help
much.
I guess the Germans just are proud over their Nazi-Kill-'em-All-Everyone-
But-Us-Germans-Sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude
in every possible sport (remember the European champs in Stockholm in soccer)
It really pisses me off!
I do not mean that every single German has this attitude that sucks, but 
most of them seem to do...

  What the hell are U talking about? ESPN showed Pens/Devils game as advertised.
  BUt the morons at ESPN should know that Pens will kick Devils ass and the
  game will be boring. I'd rather see Boston/Buffalo game which seems to be
  an exciting series since noone had expected Buffalo to get past the first
  round. 

  Well let's hope they change their mind on THU's game and show some other
  game. The Pens series is really getting boring. I want to see some 
  exciting game no matter who wins. If NHL wants a major network contract
  then they better put some brains in ESPN people.

Unless the Hawks can somehow change fate, you're right.  

Who knows, though.  Maybe some intensive forechecking aka normal Hawks
style will nullify a seemingly unbeatable team.  Maybe the Pens are due
for a let-down.  Hell, how could they _possibly_ extend their record
making play all the way through the playoffs.?

The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe. 
And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though
they helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well
together.

Well, partly because I, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather
see Game 3 of the NHL playoffs than Game 3 of 162 of the MLB
season (even if the bb game involves the Red Sox).	

ESPN may have had contractual obligations. I understand that part.
But it's a bit inaccurate to call us ""selfish"" just because we want
to watch the watch the game we love. Am I, as a baseball fan, ""selfish""
when I get pissed a CBS for showing approximately one game per month?
I don't think so.

While, ESPN may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers,
have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us.
There's certainly nothing wrong with that.

As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey.  How the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new 
referee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons
get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 
play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an
improvement.

Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at
the talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the
Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most
likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would
help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some
light on the subject.

And, my playoff pool is running!!!  Exact rules to be posted tomorrow, but
don't hesitate to send in picks!!!

The French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the

few years...and really didn't have any substantial effect during that
period.  The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a

 I'd like to echo these sentiments.  This is the worst coverage I can 
 ever remember seeing on CBC.  As soon as the game ends, I can count to 30,
 and by that time, they've signed off the air.  No post game interviews,
 no updating of late scores, nothin'.  TSN is really putting CBC to 
 shame.  I only hope the later round coverage improves, I mean, who
 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey.

 My $.02,

Sanderson will be on Team Canada, but he'd be out of position as a center.
Although he was drafted as a center and played there as a rookie, Sanderson

So what's the deal with Bill Wirtz? Apparently, the Blackhawks - St.
Louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the Hawks
reported the attendace as 16,199. Gee, I wonder if Wirtz is planning to
use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of TV?
What a schmuck.

In other TV news, the Penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3
fewer broadcast TV games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of
subscription / pay-per-view system. Yuck.

It was Clint Malarchuk's neck cut by Uwe Krupp's skate.  I know it happened in
Buffalo, but I can't tell you against whom.

Krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.

Malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind Hasek, Puppa and Draper) after
suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.  He's been playing in San Diego
for former Sabre coach Rick Dudley.

Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

What do I win?  =)

	You know what Frank? It's not David Poile's fault that the Caps
have mired in mediocrity for so long. Blame it on the owner, Abe Polin!
This guy owns both the NBA's Bullets and the NHL's Capitals. How dumb
and selfish could this guy be? He's unwilling to spend the bucks in 
order to get a big star to Landover...no wonder both teams STINK!

	I've heard that the Capitals had a chance to get Detroit's
Steve Yzerman last summer but they pulled out at the last minute. Why?
Because our good man, Abe, is afraid to spend the cash!

	Nevertheless, I'm still faithful and hoping that one day
this devilish dictator will be replaced.

Luc Robitaille was captain of the Kings the first third of the season,
until The Great One came back from his disc injury. It was kind of
awkward, but Melrose appointed (anointed?) TGO as captain immediately upon
his return, after which he did not score a goal for something like 10
games.

I think Luc should have remained Captain all season.

While watching the Penguins/Devils game last night, I saw the ""slash"" that
Barrasso took on the neck.  This brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate.  I think he was a Sabre, but I'm not positive.
Does anyone remember/know his name?  What has happened to him since?  What
about the player whose skate cut the goalie?  Name?  Info?  Has this ever
happened before in a hockey game?

Here is yet another prediction for them great playoffs!
(you may laugh at your convenience!) :)

	Adams Division (I hate the NE (name) divisoin!!!)

BOS vs BUF   BOS in 5  (the B's are hot lately!)

MON vs QUE   MON in 7  (This will be the series to watch in the first round!)


BOS vs MON   MON in 7  (this may be a bit biased but I feel the Canadiens will
		       (smarten up and start playing they played two months ago
			( i.e. bench Savard !!!)
	Patrick Division 

PIT vs NJD   PIT in 6  (It wont be a complete cake walk... there be a few lumps
			(in the cake batter!)

WAS vs NYI   WAS in 6  	(This will not be an exciting series..IMO)


PITT vs WAS  PIT in 4   (Washington will be tired after the NYI)

	Norris Division

CHI vs StL    CHI in 5   (StL will get a lucky game in)

TOR vs DET    TOR in 7   (THis , like MON vs QUE, will be another intense 
			 (series to watch!)

CHI vs TOR    TOR in 7   (Potvin will be settling in nicely by this point.)

	Smythe Division

VAN vs WIN     VAN in 5  (Teemu is great, but Vancouver better as a team!)

CAL vs LAK     CAL in 6  (Gretzky is great, but Calgary has been on fire lately)
				...sorry for the pun... um, no I am not! :)

VAN vs CAL     VAN in 6  (This will be a great series! but VAN has proven they
			 (Will not lie down and get beat!)

	Wales Conference finals

Pittsburgh vs Montreal    	Montreal in 6 (Montreal IMHO is the only team
					      (that has a chance against 
						Pittsburgh.)

	Campbell Conference finals

Vancouver vs Toronto		Toronto in 6  (Potvin will be series MVP)


	STANLEY CUP FINALS  

Toronto Maple Leafs    vs    Montreal Canadiens    
	(The Classic Stanley Cup Final matchup!!) <---also a dream come true!

	Montreal wins the Stanley cup in the 7th game 1 - 0 in double overtime.
Roy and Potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series MVP (if 
that is possible) Vincent Damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by
Brian Bellows! Canadiens star(?) Denis Savard watched his buddies play from the
owners box nursing that splinter on his thumb which has left him on the 
disabled list since the first game of the playoffs (awww shucks).

You can get WJR a LONG way away.  The problem is that, because of those
well known and beloved ""contractual obligations"", WJR will be doing
Tiger baseball instead of the Wings playoff games for probably half
the games the Wings could play.  For this series, I know tonight's
game and I believe games 5 and 6 (if necessay) will be bumped.

I thought the red light went on...thus, in the review, the presumption
would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the

conclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion...

From his Topps ""rookie"" year (as coach) card (74-75):
""For the past couple of seasons, Don has been the highly-successful
 coach of the Rochester Americans of the AHL, but he is getting his
 first shot at an NHL job with the Bruins.  Named Coach of the Year
 in the AHL the last two years, and he aims to make the Bruins a
 rough team again, as they were a couple of years back.  Although
 he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, Don never played a
 regular-season NHL game.  He did appear in one playoff game for
 Boston in 1956-57.  Don's brother, Dick, played two seasons in the
 NHL with Boston and Philadelphia.""

 Well, here in Detroit we get to see and hear Don Cherry quite regularly.
The Detroit area picks up Hockey Night in Canada from CBC (ch 9) in
Windsor where we see Don Cherry's Coaches Corner between periods. We
also get to see Don Cherry's Grapevine just before the game. The
Grapevine is a hockey talk show where Don talks to a player or coach
about what else: Hockey.  It's actually a pretty good show and Don
isn't as annoying as he is on Coaches Corner.  I think this is were
Don got his nickname 'Grapes' but I'm not sure.  Don use to coach the
Boston Bruins.  I don't know exactly when that was.  Could someone fill
me in on this info?
  A local radio station here in Detroit (WLLZ) talks to Don every Tuesday
morning.  Personally, I've had my fill of Donny!  He really pisses me off
sometimes.  During the Detroit-Toronto game Monday night on CBC, Don gave
high praise to Doug Gilmour, saying he was a two-way player and not
just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player
in the game because of that.  That's fine and I agree that Gilmour
is a good two-way player BUT he said the EXACT same thing about Yzerman
about a month ago on a local radio talk show.  What gives?
  It seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from
city to city.
  Don Cherry:  'I think <insert star player name for city that he is in>
              is the best two-way player in the league today.'
 
  There have been other times (can't remember exactly what he said) that he
basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.
  Someone here on the net said something about how Don criticized Mario
Lemieux but when the time comes for Don to broadcast the Cup playoffs
from the Civic Center (Yes, I think the Pens will make it out of the
Wales Conference) Don will apologize left and right for his remarks about
Lemieux.  In my opinion, he is an ass.  And I won't change my opinion
if I'm in a different city.
  Sorry, if this didn't answer your question better but I just had to get
this off my chest.

The Hart Trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think
in terms of who was the ""best"" player, rather in terms of who was the most
valuable to the team.  And ""valuable to his team"" was not, and should not
be, considered synonymous with ""best"".  We are talking about a time when
honour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets
a player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  This was before
the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was 
formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.

The Hart Trophy is not a prize.  It is an honour.

It was NOT Krupp's skate.  Krupp was defending against Steve Tuttle,
of the Blues.  They both sort of tripped and fell toward Malarchuk,
and Tuttle's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just
missed) the jugular.  Malarchuk immediately fell to the ice, hands at
his neck, blood on the ice.

He'd been suffering from it for over a decade.  He just wasn't
diagnosed for it until he didn't sleep for ten days and decided to
have some alcohol to help him sleep.  Unfortunately, he'd just been
put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier.  It's amazing he lasted as
long as he did.  OCD sufferers stop distinguishing the line between
reality and imagination, or fail to accept that something they've
checked is OK now.  For example, an OCD sufferrer can wash his hands
over and over and still think they're dirty.  He might check the oven
ten times to be sure it's turned off.  He might see a movie about
something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his
own life.  Malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes,
but still needs it.  He went off it this past winter and had a bad OCD
episode and I think was in the hospital for a couple days.  (He felt
it slowed his reflexes, so he tried to go without).  In any event, he
is alive and well and living in San Diego, while playing with the
Gulls (IHL).

>Krupp is now playing for the Islanders after the LaFontaine/Turgeon trade.

Subject: FLYERS notes 4/5
Organization: AT&T
Keywords: FLYERS/Leafs summary (take that, Leafs woofers!)
Lines: 225



The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum
Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0
shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke
a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from
mounting any serious attack.

Injuries:

Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.

Roster Moves:

Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS
second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years
old, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,
12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in
this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him
up front as well.

Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period
of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,
and played again for Hershey Sunday night.

Tommy Soderstrom in goal.

Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.

Game Summary:

If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this
year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after
scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.

Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.
He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead
of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.
A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a
goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.

Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The
Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept
away every rebound.

After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour
gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the
net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef
Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for
a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.

The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS
from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies
were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.
Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had
a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into
him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno
was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 15:38

The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were
very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.

With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in
a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass
to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark
checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and
went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside
the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.

The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk
tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the
FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric
gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was
running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where
Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,
and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past
Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at
117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.

Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on
the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with
a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most
of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers
flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton
got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a
hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's
stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.
Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.
Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,
and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,
but Soderstrom stoned him.

The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't
get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.

The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they
decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a
little.

The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making
road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros 
(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)
all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.

Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.

At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the
Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom
stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through
Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout.

Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski
Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS
zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran
his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.
5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.
Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!
Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski
and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.

So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest
in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until
Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and
blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.

That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa
did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the
3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star
break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in
the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't
remember that he's tied with.

Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot
be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night
in Washington would be the official end.

FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points
in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80).

Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th
is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to
lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS
will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie
breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and
finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on.

	This comes indirectly from Al Morgani who works in the studio
for ESPN hockey.

	The management of ESPN was reluctant to leave the Pitt-NJ game 
(even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the Wash-Ny game 
going to overtime.  When the Caps scored with :02 left to tie the game, Al said
he heard many people say f**K .!#$%.  
	ESPN is under contractual obligation to show baseball and COULD NOT
broadcast the OT of the hockey game.  Next year, ESPN2 will be introduced so 
baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.

Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.

Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids
that do them are ""tough, just like a real Canadian"". 

Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug
Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. 
Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.

I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see
his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's
just an asshole.

Well I think it in 1969 the Montreal Canadians finished 1st (although
there was no President's cup in those days) and missed the playoffs 
in 1970. I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasn't decided until
the final day, when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings. The tie-breaker was
the number of goals for (if I remember correctly), so the Rangers played
with an empty net for the entire game. Some Hab loyalists accused 
the Wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out, but as I recall, 
Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu, so coach Sid Abel sat them out,
and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night.

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio
interview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the 
SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)
lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),
said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to
take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where
ever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after
three? seasons). I don't know why.

Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many
players to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but
they had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the
playoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't
consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any
team in the SM-liiga.

I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants
to be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and
decide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but
maybe they'll do some compromise.

Could somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coaching
in the former Soviet league; teams, results? His character as a coach?

Subject: Flames Truly Brutal in Loss

As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon,
dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected
to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least
five posts! The Flames best line was probably
Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary
Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored
by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made
some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially
impressive. 

The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,
hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren
Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't think
Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,
as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King
inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday's
game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no
idea how serious - he didn't return.

I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better
buckle down.

First of all, the Penguins WILL win the cup again.  Who is going to stop them?

Wales conference champ:  Pittsburgh

No, Boston probably won't go down easy, but if the Sabres hadn't won

Buffalo???!!!??? There's the Sabres-Bruins, Quebec-Montreal, and
whatever ESPN and ABC show, and on opposite nights there's
Toronto-Detroit and whatever ESPN(/ABC) shows.  More hockey than a
good chunk of North America, either side of the border.  It's
wonderful, and there are thousands of folks who'd kill to be in your
shoes, coverage-wise.

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first GM to ""waste"" high draft choices
on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,
and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more
years in his prime.

Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 85

#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade:		I (B)

It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had
only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he
has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... Peter Ahola.

#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
Grade:		I (B)

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high
expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be
Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.

#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,
he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (?)

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.
Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+)

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours
truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (D+/D)

He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is
quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.

How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can
maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.

In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-
way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.
He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and
Quinn in my estimation.

I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen
in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.

Yes, Yl|nen is a draft choice of the Jets.  (Assuming, of course, this
is the same Yl|nen that played for Kiekko-Espoo in 1990-91.)  He was a
5th round, 91st overall pick of the Jets in the 1991 entry draft.

the playoffs.

i'm not going to bother reprinting your pathetic excuse for a post. Mario  
fan, or not you have to respect what he can do with a blade. as for the  
hart trophy, i guess winning the scoring title after being out twenty-four  
days with CANCER, then leading his team to the presidents trophy and  
breaking the win streak record in the process shouldn't even qualify him  
for the award. maybe next year he'll tend a few games when barrasso needs  
a rest. be realistic, mario has earned every one of his accolades and  
deserves all the attention that he gets. lose the jealous attitude and you  
may start enjoying hockey at its finest

Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got
some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news, ""There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City,
and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..."" when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...

>If people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet

From today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a
4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2
in metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,
Seniors Golf did better ...

>Next week, there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.

I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, 'cos I don't
watch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could've sold second
rights to third party systems (i.e., non-SportsChannel) since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey
fans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball
if playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere ...

I watched him over his entire career.  I have NEVER seen a player, and that
includes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as
Bob Gainey.  And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey
with his head down.  You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey.

Gainey was a plugger.  And when the press runs out of things to say about 
the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa
Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek
Sanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri

A little supplement Basic Mike's info  :

For Sundday's opener on ABC, these are the announcing crews :

Devils/Isles at Pittsburgh - Gary Thorne(play-by-play),Bill Clement(color)
and Al Morganti roaming the halls outside the dressing rooms.
This telecast will primarily seen on the East Coast.

St.Louis at Chicago - Mike Emrick(play - by play),Jim Schoendfeld(color)
and Tom Mees roaming the halls.
This telecast will primarily be seen in the Midwest and parts of the South.

LA at Calgary - Al ""Do You Believe in Mircales?"" Michaels(play by play),
John Davidson(color) and Mark Jones as a roaming reporter.
This telecast will be seen in the Western USA.

Montreal's naitive,Jon Saunders will be hosting in the studio.

ABC will do ""Up and Close and Personal"" with Mario during Saturday's
Wide World of Sports(4:30EDT).

Sunday will be the first NHL playoff or regular network telecast in 13 years...
not counting those silly All-Star games on NBC for the last few years...

For Sunday's games,ABC will use 8 mikes(2 behind on the goal),super-super-slo-mo,
close-ups of player's faces at face-offs. ESPN/ABC will not be able to
use its new favorite toy,the ice-level shot, in Pittsburgh where too many
seats would have to removed to employ it...


In case of a blowout in progress in Pittsburgh,ABC will switch to Chicago
game but will come back to the Pittsburgh game for updates or if the game
gets closer(Ha!)..

ABC expects huge ratings(by hockey standards) since all 3 Top US TV-markets
are involved - NY metro area(NY Islanders/NJ Devils),Chicago(BlackHawks),
and LA(Kings).

Stay tuned,

Thanks Mike,

We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball
deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same
thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,
because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of 
the reasons for this is left to the reader ...

It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team
coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the
Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read
that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent
his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing
this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say
about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC
Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,
SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre
homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.

From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC
coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it
on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.

Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne.
Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.

Interestingly, Keenan's co-coach (or is it his ""Number One""?) on Team
Canada at the World Championships is Roger Neilsen.  

It'd be interesting if the Rangers call in the balance of Neilsen's
contract to be Keenan's assistant ...  Roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players, just as he handled the Cinderella Canucks
of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the Rangers like those
Canucks last May ...

We're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably
so are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the
Islanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the
Sabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game
(assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last
minute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks
ago).  ESPN's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one
or more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild
hog wrestling for the evening instead ...

Well, I gotta tell ya,

last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!
It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour).

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? 
Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,
Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs
fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well
so far??

Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost
at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.
(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't 
remember him having any as of yet.)

Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris
has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and
Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one?)

Coming to the stretch and still a ROAR'IN!!!!!
Go LEAFS Go!!!!

According to the hockey gurus over at ESPN, should the Islanders win tonite
the two teams will have the same record, but the Devils will be playing the
Penguins.  This is because the Islanders have won the season series against
the Devils.  I think the rules for deciding a tie breaker include:

1.  season series
2.  goals against
3.  goals for

in this order (correct me if I'm wrong).  Anyone have anything to add?

The top 11 teams of this tournament will play in the Olympics next year.
The last team of this tournament, top two of pool B (Great Britain and 
Poland) and the winner of pool C (Latvia) will play for the last Olympic 
spot next fall.
  However, if next year's hosts Norway were to finish 12th (which would be 
no surprise), then it's the 11th team of pool A that will have to play in 
the qualification tournament.

Norman Green claims that he has lost money over the last three years
that he has owned the team.  When he bought the team, it seemed kind of
obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,
before the team started making a profit again.  He gave the impression
that he was willing to do so.  He claimed two years ago that the team
needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,
but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket
prices.  I think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward
trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in
deciding to move.  He was even offered the many concessions he rudely
demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the
other two arenas in town, etc.

Oh well, I guess the bottom line is $$$.  Green wanted immediate huge
returns in Dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in MN. 
Dallas gave Green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although I feel
Minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down
there as well.  All this means, is that Minnesota is without an NHL team
for a year or two.  Too bad for the NHL.

I'm familiar with the telethon situation (an individual on CompuServe
was also victimized and was equally pissed).  That was a local
television station contract which could not be broken.  For that item,
I strongly suggest you call that affiliate and vent your anger on
them.  (Supposedly one station had told my friend that they have
received hundreds of angry calls which will translate into far less
incentive to pre-empt hockey telecasts in future.  The contract was
written when the pathetic WLAF was in that time slot.)

It was a classy move.  But it looks like ESPN is going to devote most of
the coverage to the Pens.  On Tuesday night, they continued to broadcast
the Pen-Devil game even though Pittsburgh had the game well in control.
Granted they did show some ""bonus"" coverage of the Caps and Isles but
they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update
us on the fifth goal of the rout.
Thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between
the pens and devils.  IMHO they should program some variety into the
telecasts.(Yes I know the game shown on saturday is between the B's and
Sabres, probably throwing a bone to us Bruin fans.)
And what about the Cambell conference?  I'd like to see a game in the
Norris or Smythe.  Why not have back to back nights of National
Hockey Night?

Just a thought.

That's a good way to put it.  It's a quiet confidence.  I don't feel like
I have to defend this team anymore. 

The Devils are a puzzle to me.  They have long been one of the few teams
I always dreaded playing.  Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they
still usually play us pretty tough.  I just can't figure it out.  At least
last night they mounted an attack.

Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news.  He was
shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like
another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.
Then he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing
off and he said, ""It just isn't right...it just isn't fair..."" and he
tried to muster a smile.

>I'm really impressed with Bowman's coaching tactics - he's had an answer for

As far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good.

One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri.  I'm sure
Tom Barrasso knows how he feels.  For so long Tommy would look up and not
have a teammate in sight.  Terreri's teammates really left him out in the
cold in the first two games.

Okay, here's the down side of the ESPN deal: no additional coverage.
With a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers
like Canucks-Jets, Caps-whoever and Red Wings-Leafs (or whoever else
is playing).

For our area (Islanders-Devils), it's likely to be the Bruins, since
the other Adams series is Montreal-Quebec.  I'd prefer the latter
myself ...

I'm under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals,
but if St. Louis at Chicago pops up we'll know ...

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this
year. I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who
is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. 
Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes. 

I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help
a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and
Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his
current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.

I'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup
was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.
But I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm
to which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.

As far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.
It's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who
just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At
last Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a
goaltender can get an
assist.

Anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
at any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to
think for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out
of this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.
Spoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through
that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for
granted.  God, look at Chicago...

And I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna
last forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  

Mom.

When Quinn took over Vancouver- several years ago, NOT LAST YEAR, they 
regularily missed the playoffs.  I can't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did.  Quinn has improved the
team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.

When Murray took over in Detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a
contender to win the Norris division and possibly even a Stanley Cup
contender.

So Quinn has improved his team more than Murray has since taking over as a GM.
Quinn is one example of a better GM than Murray.

Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 5: Left Wings
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 161

Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted
it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks
mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy
back.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will
re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.

#8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from Minnesota
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at
the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he
wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on
the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part
for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,
DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good
defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of
the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked
lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to
Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks
officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.

#10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round
		pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver
Grade:		A/A-

After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest
of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the
team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob
Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in
the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he
was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him
by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-
play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite
his small size (5' 11"", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around
when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work
on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and
was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will
be a major key to the offense next year.

#15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5th
Acquired:	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft
Grade:		I (?)

After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and
was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered
virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the
lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to
speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by
the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man
short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive
leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,
because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his
future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.

#18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud
Grade:		I (B)

It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,
after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but
after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the
Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with
41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by
injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when
healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size
(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a
physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability
on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how
much, exactly, Pederson can do.

#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from Boston
Grade:		I (B+/B)

Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard
work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he
did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55
games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can
do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about
20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always
hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive
zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,
but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress
offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He
is very unlikely to be back next season.

#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+/B)

I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the
14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating
opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL
duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those
14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training
camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in
exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the
Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a
solid contender for regular duty next season.

#41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1st
Acquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
Grade:		I (?)

After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the
Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the
Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only
NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy
to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,
although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played
mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and
Kansas City.

#42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1st
Acquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft
Grade:		I (?)

Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was
up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally
very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,
although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those
7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his
defense is acceptable, he should be ready.

#44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau
Grade:		I (B-/C+)

The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to
be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the
Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for
his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.
He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive
brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although
he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the
expansion draft.

#45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1st
Acquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
Grade:		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)

I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably
no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although
13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was
not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing
many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,
projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at
least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if
nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11"", 181 lbs.) does not give much
possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.

Hartford?  The absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity.  I can't stand it.
From what I've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as Beezer played

Binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the

Well, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at the
local ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing
David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't
even understand their problem. If they didnt think enough people would

not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And
if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play
David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming
before noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their
machine. I called gain and someone picked it up. When I asked him why they
premepted the first half hour of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he seemed a bit
confused. When I explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto
to our programming dept. call back on  Monday. weel, I understand that the
sports dept is not responsible for this preemption. BUt I can't understand
how someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs
shown on the very same station he works for.

Anyway, I am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.
I urge all Atlanta hockey fans to call WSB 2 and ask them not to do the
same thing for the next 4 weeks.

All of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey

""Dole"" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make

MIGHTY ONES GET MIGHTIER:

TPS, the Finnish Champions 1992/3, are getting still stronger!

I just heard some news, according to which TPS has acquired
the next Finnish hockey superstar(??) Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo!

There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen
(KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the
Finnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL, too.

BTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre, HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year
he has reached the top level among Finnish centres. He had very good
playoff games against TPS!

What can you expect from a buffoon who said that the Pens should have
drafted Kirk Muller instead of Mario Lemieux?  

Perhaps once upon a time Don Cherry had some insight into the game of
hockey, but he's really degenerated into a parody of himself.

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.

Ha!  Such humor!  They have MAJOR fan problems, namely that on occasion some of
them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,
much like the Montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically.

ESPN is pathetic, I have been watching everybody complain about ESPN's coverage
and I agree with all of you.  Might I suggest that we are getting all worked up
over nothing.  We ALL knew that ESPN's coverage was going to suck.  I mean have
you ever watched during the regular season Sportscenter coverage of hockey? It
sucks, I mean really sucks!!!  ESPN does not know hockey if it shot them in the
ass.  I was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  I go to school in Ohio
I *know* the Indians suck, so why show them?  If I were Bill Clement I would
shoot myself.

Anyway after I calmed down after I realized that they were not going to show
overtime of the Caps Isles game I thought to myself I knew that this was going
to happen, in fact I remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even
the boring Devils game.

Overall I think ESPN does not care if they show hockey or not and I firmly
belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       
obligations*, screw you ESPN.

Praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!

GO HAWKS!!!

I hope this makes you feel better, but the overtime between the Isles and

The USA Today says ""late this year"".  The question is, will hockey be moved to
ESPN2 permenantly, or will it be where they have a game of the week on
ESPN, and have a bunch of other games on ESPN2?

   Which doesn't mean much since the statistics are mostly based on
the 5-game playoff format. But, yes, it looks dark for the B's. What a
disappointment.

   Still, I think the problem is mental. They needed the saves Blue
came up with, perhaps he can offer something to mentally rally around.

   Who do you think gets the start in game three? I hope it is going
to be Blue. If the team can rally around him, maybe Moog can too.

	In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils
on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in
addition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because
the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the
Bruins every time there is a conflict. You can also get WBAL Baltimore but
I don't think they have hockey. BTW, I once got a station from Indiana that
had Fort Wayne Comets games.

During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams
have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of
the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the Leafs defense in
this regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different
story...every good team is going to have players who are going to
become potted plants in front of Potvin...and the Leafs relatively
unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.

Hard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost
to 100 points...and the Leafs deserve credit for that...but in the 
playoffs talent matters, because everyone begins working hard.

How long can the Leafs play short-handed and still be expected to
score?  They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldn't keep it 
up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or
just coming off a penelty -- as soon as they'd get re-grouped, they're
penalized again!
 
Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you can't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if you're going
to, you have to do it for both teams.
 
Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and
then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.
 
Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of
games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line
can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --
he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left 
wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should
be benched.
 
I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel can't
do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we 
need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay 
considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin 
messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can 
easily do it again.
 
My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins 
will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand
by that.
 
Don't fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to
win 3! :-)
 
Burns is going to make some magic -- he'll mix up some lines.  Match
the Wings line-per-line.  He'll have his team checking hard, and he'll
never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win
Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the
first one).

Just a side note, squid/octopi made their way to the ice in Buffalo.
I still don't understand why Buffalo, but maybe it's lucky.  :-)  btw,
they shovel them up from the ice here, using the shovel used to scoop
up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice.  Although Blue

Why do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the
same number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are
tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind
Chicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?  Only
by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to
Detroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the
Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong.

   You might want to clarify the 11 game winning streak.  That Pens streak
is a PLAYOFF streak (tied by the Chicago Blackhawks, who had won 11 in a row
until they met the Pens in the finals last year)  The 18 game unbeaten, so far,
is a regular season unbeaten streak.  But hey, don't take it personally.  I'm a
Flyers fan and two in a row is a stretch.  But with a healthy Lindros, Recchi,
Brind'amour and Tommy Soderstrom, they'll be there next year!
By the way, since the Flyers need defenseman, what kind of trade would
anybody suggest from the existing Flyers roster since the scuttlebutt is that

Terry Carkner won't be there next year and apart from him a piece of notebook
paper would be better defense.

For those of you who complain about Don Cherry, and wonder why he is
popular...

the reply is Dick Vitale and John Madden and Bobby Knight and
Joe Garagiola and Howard Cosell.

John Madden picks Gary Clark of the Redskins for his All-Madden team
a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons Cherry
sings the praises of Doug Gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
doesn't see a string of American posts saying that John Madden has
lost his marbles.

Dick Vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements.

Why should Americans expect that Canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   Canadians
are very similar to Americans...culturally our sports are just hockey
and curling, whereas with Americans it is football/basketball/baseball
and bowling.

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the
Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a
match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for ""delay of game""
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans
were starting to come up strong.
I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.
If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the
Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best
team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to
admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team
to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).
But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)
Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a
great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience
most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all
Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries...). 
In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

Pierre,
For purposes of the tie breaker, you only count the first three games in
each city. Therefore, Quebec cannot possibly be ahead of Montreal 4-3,
and there's probably only one game that counts remaining between Boston
and Quebec, which means Boston has probably already won.

Later on, in your posting, you make reference to ""putting words

along with Greg, claim that Gainey never made a technical
mistake.  If you actually read what I've written, you will find
that I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well,
you're contradicting yourself.

4/23/93    BLUES SHUTOUT HAWKS AGAIN, LEAD SERIES 3-0
-----------------------------------------------------
It was a great atmosphere last night at the St. Louis Arena as Joseph and
the Blues shutout the Hawks for the second consecutive game. People were
cheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the
entire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning
hours with some of the players. Here's a game summary from the St. Louis
Post-Disptach. Enjoy...

By Dave Luecking
Of The Post-Dispatch Staff:

At 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues
goalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the
the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than
Joseph.""  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to
the verge of a surprising sweep.

Joseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks
3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0
lead in the best-of-seven series.

The Blackhawks haven't scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second
period of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,
a Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the
first round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only
two series the Blues have sweeped in their history.

The Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,
a nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had
only two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept
Philadelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.

The shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to
make 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the
Blackhawks couldn't touch Joseph.

Well, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at 
every opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues
were unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.

The Blues' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --
wore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.
The grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and
scorers, who made the most of their opportunities.

Craig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each
period. Hull assisted on Janney's first-period power play goal after two unwise
Chicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull's goal in the second period, and
rookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final 
period.

Blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling
``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep."" They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour 
``Bell-Four. Bell-Four."" They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.""

Such talk is a tad premature. There's still one game left, but the Blues are
on a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.

The Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first
minute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan
dumped Steve Smith at center ice.

Chicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray's decision to run into Joseph
backfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.

The Blues didn't get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a
scare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to
Steve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threw
at him in the first period. The 'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph
about shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph's butterfly
style is deadly.

Rookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the
period -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two
shots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues' penalty killer twice stole the
puck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.
 
Marouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.
He caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican's third
penalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,
and gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu
slashed Shanahan.

The Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it
where he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull's shot hit Belfour's right
shoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour
dived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into
the net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.

The Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the
Blackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds
remaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by
shooting the puck into the Blues' bench.

Chris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and
Marouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues'
power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn't return until the midway
point of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased
the Blues' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller's crisp pass.

Try as they might, the Blackhawks couldn't get to Joseph, who stopped
everything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period
and 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.

Emerson's goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected
Felsner's pass.

It's bad jokes like that which draws crohns, I mean groans from the crowd...
Don't bother looking it up in the appendix, it's useless anyway.

If you go to a Miami game, stay away from any foods made with ""natural casings""

		With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take the
cup easily.  The only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone.  They need some massive teamwork.
	They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockey
Montreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it was
rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21
years.  But I know that is no excuse.  But if the Habs manage to get some
good teamwork and get into the spirit,  they should have no problem
winning in May.

I only have one comment on this:  You call this a *classic* playoff year
and yet you don't include a Chicago-Detroit series.  C'mon, I'm a Boston
fan and I even realize that Chicago-Detroit games are THE most exciting
games to watch.

Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup. 
Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is)
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win.  After
each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice.  (They are dead by the way.)  It was a brilliant marketing strategy to
shore up the demand for one of their least popular products.

Hope this helps.

Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver
dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the
anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are
used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket
change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only
dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative
coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of
thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no
chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, what's
the current cost and what's its potential value?  Just curious.  If no
one knows, I'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or
whatever it is).  Thanks again

Whoa there!  Lighten up, Andrew!  When I was referring to ""you dorks at
the Western Business School"", I was specifically referring to those
assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
Minnesota for no apparent reason.  Being Canadian, and one who has
friends who attended UWO, I personally don't want to be associated with
the idiots who wrote those messages.  One more thing, Andrew...until
this season, the Leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen
years (have they won the Cup during our lifetime?)...so the North Stars
haven't been the only ""shit"" team in the Norris.

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I
can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are
""in part"" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
has about the player.  


> To compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...

And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
and yet...

How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game.

Michael J. Fox was on Letterman about a year ago (or two) during the 
playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the Bruins.  While he's not
exactly a NHLer he did mention that the Bruins wanted to break Ulfie's
legs (or something like that) in response to the Neely incident.  It
was quite amusing, as one of the few Letterman viewers who actually knew
what he was talking about.  Anybody know who the Pens celebrity hockey
player is?  Michael Douglas (aka Michael Keaton)?

I've heard that you can score on Belfour by shooting high 
because he goes down a lot, and on Potvin by shooting high 
on him and then getting the rebound in because he plays so
deep in the net.  Any truth to these?

Except for Vancouver, of course.  Bure has a hard time scoring on that
power play.  He's got 7 shorthanded goals and 13 pp goals I think!

     Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,
at the Civic Arena.

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best 
strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.
Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,
when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; 
what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

Others can add on their opinions as well.

The overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the Quebec 
defender who deflected the puck.  The re-play officials did not 
take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first 
non-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial.

I agree that it was a great game; good to see Roy and Damphousse back
into form.  Hopefully the sign of good things to come...

In Detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. In
the era of the Original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  To win the Cup,
a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8
playoff wins to win the Cup.  The octopus (8 legs) has become a common
Detroit symbol.  Every year around playoff time people start sneaking
octopus (octopi?) into the Joe Louis Arena and throwing them onto the ice.

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you
ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your
hockey education is not my responsibility.

He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find
bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever 
skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?

Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why
would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players
here.  If you can't follow the conversation don't follow up.  As I
said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.

Sure.  Two journeymen.  Big deal.  Neither one of them is worth
discussing.

That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time
responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure
to implement that very macro.

Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a ""hockey god.""  And Greg ate it up.
And that is what this thread is all about.  If you didn't know 
that then why are you responding?

And as for ""blanket disregard for these individuals"", I can remember 
Leaf teams, purely populated by such ""individuals"", winning four 
Stanley Cups.  Teams.  No one ran around telling us that George
Armstrong was the best hockey player in the world.

Well, Your Majesty, ;^), couldn't you just picture it?  Cherry starts doing

 First of all I think when ESPN covers the game they do a wonderful job, but
 last night I felt the same way. I really hate watching Devils/Pens game. 
 Everyone knows that Devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even 
 bother showing them. I was so bored and these ESPN people don't seem to have
 any brain. After the Sundays and last night games, they are still going to 
 show Devils/Pens on THU and SUN. WHat the hell are they thinking about? I 
 think if they keep it up like this NHL will never get a major network contract.
 I'd rather see Caps/Isls game which is more exciting. 

 Now I just hope all baseball games are rained out on ESPN so atleast
 we can get diffrent hockey games.

And where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans?? Dont say

I mean, look at the way you play these days. Less fights and more hockey.
Imho, canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the

Hooray, I hear on TSN that the Jets have won a game, Selanne
getting a hat-trick!

Of course, here in GOD'S COUNTRY (read Ontario!) I couldn't
see that game, nor any other in the VAN-WPG series so far,
because our beloved CBC figures no one out here cares about
this series (which has looked pretty competitve so far...

On Monday and Wednesday nights, CBC could have shown the Toronto-
Detroit game, done the news, then picked up Winnipeg-Vancouver.
They didn't.  Tonight?  You guessed it, Toronto-Detroit, the
news (not the end of the Jets game), then Calgary-LA.

SO, if it's ""Hockey Night in Canada"", why can't this Ontarian see
one of the two series with two Canadian teams?  Is this too much to

The Wings player was Yves Racine, and he returned later in that same period.

I got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown
away.  I am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between April 5
and April 17.  It looks like about 200 entries got lost.  *Sigh*.

Therefore, I would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend
it ASAP.  I am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the
deadline today.

Thanks in advance, and I apologize for the problem.

The San Jose Sharks and Ottawa Senators are each on their second GM
already...I'd be willing to wager that both the Sharks and Senators
will probably see their 3rd GM's and perhaps their 4th, before we
see the Panthers second.

  To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:

  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people 
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. 
Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the 
issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic 
Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty 
confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will 
ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the 
inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) 
believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, 
because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed 
until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  
However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for 
conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to 
this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future 
viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even 
further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of 
knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, 
which may happen.
	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are 
Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota ""
Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't 
been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the 
Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in 
as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see 
Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up 
getting another team, but it may take a few years.

	
	Go Sabres!

Yeah, and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35
minutes a game and play on the power play and kill penalties and be the
best defenseman in the league. I'd take a whole team of Chelioses if I
could. (That way, when one got a penalty the others could kill it!)

what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final
and now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !!
after the 0:1 against Italy it seems they lost any hope and were
overrun 0:6 by the russian team.
now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the
B-level. does anybody know if this WC is the qualification tournement for
the olympic games '94 in Lillehammer or are some teams already
qualified for them.

2) Hitting....Hawks tried to outmuscle Blues but could not do it.
Instead, Blues matched Hawks hit for hit and crunched the shit out of
them in game #4.....Scud line, Shanahan, Butcher, and Zombo particularly
took turns bashing favorite targets like Chelios.

3) Skating.....when the Hawks tried to outskate Blues, they could not do
that either.  Nelson Emerson finally showed up and skated circles around
flat footed Chicago defense.....Hedican, Felsner, Ron Wilson and others
also proved that with old cement skaters like Goulet and Keith Brown,
Blues could lap Chicago in a 400 M relay race.


     I agree with #2 but you are wrong about #3.  In fact, the only
     point where the Hawks in any way matched the Blues was when
     they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate
     the Blues.  They scored and took the lead.  Too bad it was
     Game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties.  When the
     Hawks skated, they outskated the Blues and took control.

I was at a Cincinnati Cyclones game a year ago when the local country
station sponsored a kazoo giveaway.  After a particularly bad call by the
underexperienced ECHL ref, it was Kazoostorm time down on the ice.  I
thought this was a pathetic display by the fans, but they were rightfully
unhappy.

I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but
he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he
were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's
only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though
not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided 
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the
award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be
MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the 
rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer
goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.

What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC?
I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson for
Binghamton, but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
for Springfield, while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden. The Whalers allowed
the NHL to decide, and the NHL chose the WCs. How does this differ from the
Rangers and Oilers? Did the Whalers have to go through the league, or could
they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield?

It's about time the boys got it together!!
They were outworked and outplayed by the Wings in the first two games.
But Burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full
gear (or is that high gear?) in game 3.  Except for a 10-15 minute stretch
in the 2nd period, they outskated and outworked the Wings.  Please don't
flame this statement 'cos you know it's true!  I have to admit that 
goaltending was the key.  Potvin kept the Leafs ahead during the sleepy
stretch the Leafs went through in the 2nd.  He also kept the rebounds to a
minimum, something that cost Cheveldae 2 goals.  Clark even looked like
he had stopped moping (first star!), although I still don't know why he
was so flat in games 1 and 2.

If the Leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game
3, they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance, 
but a chance....I'm no RM.....where is he anyways? haha).

I have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
but......
by far the worst ""band  wagon"" fans are the PIT fans (at least at the present).
Case in Point -- I know a guy who just came to Hockey Hell(TM) from Pitt U.
Him - ""How 'bout the Pens? The're F-ing awesome""
Me - ""Yeah but beating up on the Devils doesn't mean alot. Wait until
	they meet Boston and/or Detroit in the Playoffs start.""
Him - ""When do the Playoffs start?""
Me - ""Uhhhh. They started a week ago.""

I'm not saying that this is true of all the Waddlers fans but there seems to 
be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
that they're newly beloved Waddlers are the best team in the game right now
and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.

Belfour kicked Gerrard Gallant when the Wings played the 'Hawks

This was after he attacked Bob Probert in the previous period.
He was penalized for that.

Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.  And take it from
an informed observer, Ronnie Francis has had a *much* better season than
Jaromir Jagr.  This is not to take anything away from Jaro, who had a 
decent year (although it didn't live up to the expectations of some).

True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way
until the medal games. He wants Teppo Numminen, too. And Kurri, but for
them the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have
already. 

Even without these players I think we have pretty good team. Young,
hungry, talented guys, no old players that have got everything (except
the gold). Yesterday's practise game, SWE-FIN 6-6, shows that the two
world's best hockey teams ;) are in prime shape.  The Finn line
Riihijarvi(slightly injured)-Saarikoski-Viitakoski shined. I bet these
two teams are the best in the NHL, too. Roger, Roger?

What do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros, Brind'Amour,
Burke, Ranford, Recchi, Dineen...? Can they beat the Finns:?

Coaching news:

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the
dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second
line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL.
They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these
Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
were not for the depth provided by these players.

They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good
players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who
provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.

As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That
doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians
had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could
dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.
He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been
anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.

This is not a trend. The Caps were done. Goneso in five games, and it saves
us Caps fans a lot of pain.

I mean, it would be more painful if the Caps were up 3-1, watching them 
tumbled when they need ONE MORE WIN to clinch the series. How many times
have they done that in their history?

1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the Isles, lost 3 straight
1987 up 3-1 against the Isles, lost 3 straight
1992 up 3-1 against the Pens, lost 3 straight

In other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they 
were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being 

1) a sweep of Philly in 1984
2) the 1990 win against the Rangers in the Patrick finals, the ONLY TIME 
they managed to get out of the division.

Actually, Saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. We all know the Caps
are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. Examples:

1) game 4 against the Isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,
gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the
last minute. After that goal, Bobby Carpenter botched a penalty shot.
Series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.

2) game 4 against the Rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd 
period, blew it. Lost game in OT and three consecutive games.

3) game 6 against Pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.
Blew it and the series.

4) game 3 against Isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. Blew it.

5) game 4 against Isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.
Blew it again.

When they were leading by 3 in game 4, I said to myself: ""if they blew this
lead, the series is OVER"". They have lost all the momemtum. The Islanders
believe they can come back no matter what the score is.

I am still waiting for a Cap goalie who can carry the team, who can 
completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear 
lives in a crucial game.

>The Admiral, a hopeless Caps fan.
>P.S. We still remember that 3 OT loss to the Islanders! Aurggghhhhhhhhh!
Well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. When the Caps
were frustrated year in year out by the Islanders, I was thinking ""wait
until Potvin/Bossy/Trottier/Smith retire"". Well, they retired (even though
Trottier was still able to haunt the Caps on a Pens uniform), yet another
generation of Islanders were still doing the same thing. Well, I guess 
it has nothing to do with the players.

Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM
triumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck
Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd ""office of the GM"". And a
4th is likely to happen before September; they'll either add the new
coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be
amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the
Panther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL
Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.

Given the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and
the reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the
first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have
instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton,
and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh
did, but they needed a quarter century.

No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that
goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're
Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;
he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,
Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.

Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). 
Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than 
five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't
think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to 
play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this
article, if possible.

>Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and

>gone in.

I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)
in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in
regardless.

>Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)

Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,
IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.

Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a
team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their
zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red 
Army.  

But I still hate the team.

On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a
powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. 
Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is
waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New
Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is
unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I 
hate that team anyway.

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.  

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the
Bruins play the Captials in the first round.

Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional 
playoff.

You, along with Mario Lemieux, must be from another planet.  The only
difference is that Lemieux comes from the one with Geo. Washington, Abe
Lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come
from the one with David Koresh.  Yeah, Mario is good at drawing penalties,
but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team
an advantage?  I don't remember Lemieux getting any diving penalties this
year, whereas many others did.  Finally, Mario has NEVER complained about
being hit.  He knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an
even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting
them up.)  Don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
much in his life?

Actually, that's based on the NHL's history of 7 games.  The statstical
odds of winning one straight game -- 50/50.  Two straight games -- 25%.  Three
straight games -- 12.5%, 4 straight games = 6.25%.  The odds of the Penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061%.  Of course, this doesn't
include weighted average, but the Pens beating the Devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the Rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out.  That's about right.  For Boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10% (with weighted average) since Buffalo's record isn't as
good and Boston has a stronger team.  Enough about my QBA probabilities though!
It's just goes to prove ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, if you integrate that to Debbie
Gibson :-)

Moog gets about ***'s out of 5 for his performance from me.  I give Blue 4
starts.  Fuhr has been too tough.  Buffalo caught a hot goaltender just in
time...I mean, after all, Buffalo is 3 wins, 7 losses in their last 10.

It's very frustrating to lose, and you've gotta say something.  Actually
it's not about winning or losing, it is how you play the game.  But when the
competition is magnified to this level, 99.9% of the people only care about
who wins or loses :-)

>schedule! Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer

I think Buffalo will win in 6 -- it's not like Boston is getting blown away.
They lost 2 OT games -- with a different bounce, they could easily be up 2-1.

Good point here.  Chicago's in deep trouble tonight.  The 'Hawks have a bad

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive
site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those
are not verified.  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results.  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should
only be three penalties:

1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.

2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the
   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you
   are thrown out of the game, and fined.

3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot
   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.

Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,
until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.
Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can
take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network
announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and
Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the PA announcer says it.

Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play
cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network
can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told
them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a 
chance of pronouncing his name right.

Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,
for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting
contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their 
routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods
either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The
game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a
10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.

The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in
commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.
On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch
it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then
it truly is a sad day.

Enough for now.

Most knowledgable observers once again watched in shock as the Detroit Red
Wings again beat the best goaltender in the world six times en route to 
another easy victory over the best team in the NHL. 

For the best goaltender in the world, Felix Potvin, six was a bad number as
he surrendered six goals and collected six minutes in penalties in reponse
to the goon tactics employed by the inferior Red Wings team.

My apologies for the typo - I meant the Wings had 5 power plays in the
first period and the Leafs none.  

As well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were
calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the Wings.

Having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
calling a bunch against the other to ""make up for it"" takes a lot away
from what could have been a great game.

How many players of international class an average NHL team has. 6-10?
Top players just play more in smaller rinks. Is the quality of European hockey
really poor, then recent years only few north-american (usually good farm 
players) players have got place in Finnish league or Elitserien, while most 
have been shipped back.

If my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling
as few penalties as possible. Quebec's powerplay is lethal and it is to their
advantage to have a penalty-filled game where they can clean up with their
superior powerplay. 

Montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because Patrick Roy is well on
his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. The man is
truly overrated. Quebec has scored six goals on Roy and four, perhaps five, 
were quite stoppable.

That would be Clint Malarchuck.  It was speculated at the time, that
the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end
of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the
ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  Ditto, if he
were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on 
standby.

If you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood
there was.  It was literally spurting out all over the ice, as Clint
grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  

Amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the
NHL.  He was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,
and didn't play for too long afterward.  Some people speculated that
he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and I
think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.
He did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after
that, and then I believe he retired.

Anyone else?

The worst thing is that this is exactly what I did last year.  I had the Rangers

I think Thorne earns his money.  The best part is that he is the same way when 
he is earning his $$ from SportsChannel as the Devils announcer (i.e.,
unbiased).  He goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more 
excited (if possible) for great saves.  He did a good job of explaining certain 
things to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport
(unlike NBC's clowns for the ASG).

Ruotsaleinen was a more than competent NHL'er...his choice of where
to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.

He was crucial to the Oilers Stanley Cup victory in 1990, the one
without Gretzky, because he made an Oiler power play which was
lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive.  The
Oilers missed him more the following year than Kurri, and I think
the Oilers would have make the finals if Ruotsaleinen has stayed
around the following season, and would have beaten Pittsburgh
with Ruotsaleinen and a healthy Messier...and delayed Pittsburgh's
dynasty by a season.

Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players
stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system.

Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of
causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't
like it, but that's the way the league is going.

By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil
game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a
legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
things like that.)

Here in the middle of Connecticut there are plenty of Bruin Fans, many who have
let me know in no uncertain terms that the Rangers choked down the stretch.  I
think the Bruins are doing the same exact thing the Rangers did, they're
playing too tight!!  Who's responsibility is it to check Mogilny?  He has
gotten off a number of quality shots on goal of which there are many rebounds
which are not being cleared by the B's defense.  It's too bad the B's might not
get the opportunity to play Pittsburgh again.  I would really enjoy seeing
Ulfie get beat up by Neely.  We all hate Ulfie, but would love him on are
team!!

I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. 
But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking
one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support
them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  

>Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87. 

Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.

You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that
it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.
a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And
before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back
and read from where this thread started...

It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is
amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick*
*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.

I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to
the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket
holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings
initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)
and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  

Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since
Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim
that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler
dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like
McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
Forum even if the tickets were sold.

>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend
>winning as the major drawing power.  

For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they
make people around them better.

>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)

Well, at least we are in full agreement here!

So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>

Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of
reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think
that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without
Selanne.

I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the 
CFL...did you leave it out because you don't know much about the CFL?  If 
that's the case then fair enough, but if it isn't the case then I'm curious
to hear your explanation.

Exactly my point.  If you'd watch games more closely, you'd see a lot 
of goons going after him.  Ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical 
players for Pgh are left alone.  Ulf plays rough hockey, but only when 
other players are putting the rush on Mario or Jagr.  If you want to say anyone
on the Penguins is a cheap shot or a goon, say it's Jennings or Caufield.  Don'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players can't beat the Pens
even when they take dives (like Gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.

Hey, that's fine!  If a player does something stupid, he should be penalized
including Ulf.  Or Mario (you're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter.  It's pointless to say any one person is a cheap-shot goon,     because you'll see EVERYONE take a cheap shot now and then, especially if you'resomeone who is shadowed as much as Ulf is.

Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner.
The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on,
saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS,
USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall.
Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous
spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are).
And everyone gets TNT now.

So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave
hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN
in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between
channels every week.

But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?

I too think that Joseph has had a GREAT year and should be considered for the
Vezina.  I think Barrasso and Joseph should be the two strongest candidates
this year.  I don't believe ALL of the hype that Roy, Belfour and now Potvin
receive for their goaltending.  I do think that they are great in the nets,
but I would rather have Curtis, Tommy or Fuhr in the nets during this years
playoffs.  The big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front
of them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  I would rather face 25 shots
a game, than have to rely on Joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to
face 35 shots, I would rather have Joseph or Barrasso facing them.

Organization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada

Nntp-Posting-Host: swanlake.cs.ualberta.ca


I heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in Edmonton.
Oiler owner Peter Pocklington will be holding a press conference
next week. While the exact details are not known, it is believed
to concern the Oiler's future.

Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,
Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that
the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to
renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.

Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,
but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.

As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly
supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market
team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems
that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans
than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if
the team does move, there is no place more deserving than
Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand
realignment scheme of Bettman?

 Marcus Thuresson had 6 goals, 10 assists, 16 points and 22 PIM in 31 games
 this season for Leksand in the Swedish elite league. This was only 10th
 in point scoring for Leksand.

 Marcus (born May 31 1971, Ht 185 cm, Wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he
 might still start producing, but I think the Sharks may have done a bad
 trade here.

Wood played most of his junior career in Seattle.  He was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
1992.  He rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the WHL.

However, I was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially in
the third round.  He certainly didn't look like NHL material...

	(I live in Santa Barbara... for reference... I think)

	Okay, ABC showed the Kings/Flames... fine... YAWN.

	ESPN (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the
  Red Wings/Toronto game... cool.

	But I SWEAR that the advertisements all week long had said that
  ESPN would show Pitt/NJ on Tuesday and Bos/Buff on Thursday.

	I raced home from work early (4:30 Pacific) to catch the game, but
  ALAS, it was the Boston/Buffalo game and then they promised that they would
  show the Pitt/NJ game on Thursday.  OVERNIGHT they changed their mind.

	I didn't mind THAT MUCH.  I watched the game (hockey is MUCH better
  than NO hockey).  During the game their were no video highlights from the
  Patrick division.  What the hell was going on?  At least they should show
  video highlights of the other games (especially the NYI/Caps game that was
  so close).  My father (lives in Bowling Green, Kentucky [Bumbf*ck, Egypt])
  got to watch the Pens game on ESPN.  I just don't get it.

	The biggest problem is that Buffalo or Boston fans who didn't want
  to see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 2, will turn on their TVs on Thursday
  and see the Pittsburgh/New Jersey game 3 instead of the Buffalo/Boston game
  3.  At least, in my case, I just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.

	If I were a big Boston or Buffalo fan and I missed the game on
  Tuesday due to false advertising on the part of ESPN, I'd be mad as
  hell.

	Oh well... hopefully we'll get better coverage next year OR
  SOMETHING.

P.S.  The announcers for the Buffalo/Boston were the worst that I have
	ever heard (as far emotion goes).  They had the enthusiasm of
	""Droopy Dog"".  I hope for better on Thursday.

Yup. Then again, there are lots of foreign-born players on the Canadian
national soccer team so the Brits give something back to you in the end:-)

For the record, former NY Rangers coach Ted ""Darth"" Sator recently led

I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a ""significant"" advantage.
At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I
can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could
play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these
older guys did not. 
And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he
wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic
in thinking they could make up for his contributions.
An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around.

The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But
you have to find the right balance.

The new name is Florida Panthers.  
The panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the Everglades.
A couple of years ago, there were license plates made with Panthers on
them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund).

The name of the new President of the Panthers should be announced today.

As of yesterday's paper, Huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at
the Miami Arena this fall.  The team has a guaranteed two-year lease with
the arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.

""It's not our choice"", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option.  ""The NHL told us we 
can't stay there.  It's not economically feasible.""

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit
potential.

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade, 
and Palm Beach counties.

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents
10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending
an eight-year battle of wills.

Hey American Hockey fans,

As a hockey fan I can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  The
problem is that other Americans don't give a shit about hockey.  They view
it as a bunch of Canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the
shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in
two-thirds of the US to see the stuff naturally.  On the other hand
BASEBALL is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* ""NATIONAL PASTTIME"".  BASEBALL is so
romanticized in the US that you are supposed to forget that other sport
exist after April 1 and before November 1.  I feel that since ESPN shows 5+
BASEBALL games a week they should be able to show an OT hockey game instead
of the opening innings of a BASEBALL game.  Hell, the game is going to last
2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  And I am an Indians
fan!  Show the end of what you started, then switch!  But then, I'm a
hockey fan, what do I know?  BASEBALL is the all mighty sport.

Quebec dominated Habs for first 2 periods and only Roy kept
this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal.
Canadians showed up in third but Nords were playing dump &
pull back most of the time. Hextall made some good saves but
really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3
& could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. Canadians are dead

Wood is fairly small for an enforcer-type. I mean, Fleury does a pretty good
job and isn't that large, but Dody is no Fleury. 

Having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup, he simply isn't
ready to fight at an NHL level (assuming that it's his role, which is ALL he
really showed us in his few games up from K.C. -- if he can pass, shoot or
skate, I never saw much of it). All he has is a right fist, which isn't bad,
but at the NHL level, the other players are smart enough to grab the thing
before he can land anything significant. Once you control that hand, he's a
fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything
he wants to him. His entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach
until he found an opening -- and I never once saw him find an opening worth
talking about. He got neutralized quickly, and stomped on a couple of times.

Unless he shows some new tricks in camp, he'll be on my ""career minor
leaguer"" list. Since this was his first taste of the NHL, I expect the
Sharks gave it to him so he'd KNOW what he'd have to work on off-season. He
needs to get stronger, he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some
versatility as something else than a simply goond, because he wasn't
particularly good as a goon.

Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little
easier for the playoffs. Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of
each other while Chicago sweeps st.louis. That just makes it easier in
the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting
none. For the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division
but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the
Hawks again. Then bring pitt. and sure the Hawks will probably lose but
its better to get that far and lose than to not go.

Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have
affected the AHL this year.


ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS
The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but
off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the
leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of
the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played ""home"" games in places
like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff ""home""
games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One
demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and
rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.
Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs
will return to St John's once the strike ends.
===================================================
SENATORS SOLD
The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to
the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian
NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear
they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic
Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL
head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it 
clear the league was more interested in the stability of the 
AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining
the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. 

The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown
New Brunswick and are expected to move there.
==================================================
DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. 

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city.

The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold
1400 for this year.
============================================================
SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL
The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of
Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200
Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion
frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.
=========================================================
CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE
Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore
Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,
announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.
There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced
a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players
including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited
farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.
======================================================
AHL GAME OF THE WEEK
In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced
by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian

Roger why do you continue to embarass yourself with your brash predictions?

They got whitewashed by a last place team.  Granted Philly is pretty decent
but the ""best team in the Cambell Conference"" would have beaten a last

Well, as a hockey fan, I think it's terrible. It's one thing to say, ""Hey, 
let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!"" -- that's fine. It's
entirely another to say, ""Okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town
and move it!"" 

Of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but
from what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that
they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000
level that Green wanted, yet he refused every time. It's pretty obvious that he
was determined to get out of Minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
thing as an excuse. 

I was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and
the fans were great! People were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have SRO, and the
whole atmosphere in the Centre was terrific. Minnesota IS Hockey, USA. How the
NHL can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 
me. I only hope they get a new team soon.

Just my $0.02.

Perish the thought...but you know, you may be right, at least as far
as MAJOR LEAGUE professional sports teams go.  They all seem to be
becoming BIG MONEY games, much more so than at any previous time.  To
think that if I am ever able to move back home several years from now,
all that may be there is an AHL team, at best...SIGH.

The interesting thing is that the NHL is also expanding, at the same
time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to
operate a team.  This would seem to indicate that there's a BIG
shake-out about to occur in the next few years, unless player salaries
can somehow be brought under control.  Frankly, I don't see how the
NHL's current drive for expansion is supportable under its current
operating conditions.  If revenue sharing AND a salary cap don't come
into the NHL soon, look out.

Organization: University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada

Here's a summary of Don Cherry's Coach's Corner from April 23, 1993.
It was taken from a tape delay of a Vancouver-Winnipeg game, but
it was filmed during the Toronto-Detroit game that night. I think
it was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. 

(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)

Topics
------

Don's Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,
Wendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.

Episode Summary
---------------

Once again, the episode started with a shot of Don's tie... This
was a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the
characters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the
Cat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.

Ron Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs
game. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players ""They
won in their building, we're going to win in ours"".

Don then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour
has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he
got 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that
he gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible
for his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour
from the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk
resulting in a goal.

On the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in
the first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed
however, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells
the Leaf players ""Don't let them score on you"".

Ron brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal
won that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner
disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don
thought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of
instant replay.

On the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning
the series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.
Fuhr should be getting 1/2 the team's playoff checks for his
play.

Wendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance
during the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying
that he can't play the way he should, because of the league's
new rules. ""This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its
all hack and slash."" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the
problems.

Don's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings
GM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray
was shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination
of fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article
in which Murray makes the following statements: ""Players don't fight
because they're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.
Instead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing
each other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there
wouldn't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.""

Don warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to ""smarten up"" with
fighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used
to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,
someone gets cut every period.

Rating
------
Typical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don's opinion is supported
by Murray.

I'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff

At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.
Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of
17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to
the playoff-bound Blues.

The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.
With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit
playing.

They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared
with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.
Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating
supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired.

``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.

If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'
disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.

``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as
good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but
it did.""

Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.
Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks
in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at
Chicago Stadium.

The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,
their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,
which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its
first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.

The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.

``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score
two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.
``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have
ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""

Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.
``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3
for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""

Some players didn't have a problem.

``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich
Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You
can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.

``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""

Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,
he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.

``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the
bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,
and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end.""

The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score
showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third
period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.

``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,""
Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""

If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might
bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.

Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd
going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,
Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.

With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked
defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.

Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski
after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.

Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the 
rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend.

Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form
of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.

``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and
I know he was watching. I know he's happy.""

Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo
at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds
later, making it 5-1.

Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland
scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass
from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.

Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third
period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals
to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third
period.

The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the
winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""

Well, suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the
substantial investment in equipment, etc. But here's something, do 
you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey
could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey? I would
argue this is having an effect here. Kids play ice hockey in the
winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates.

I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending
it.



#2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		C/C-

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still
wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works
hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an
offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year.

#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from New Jersey
Grade:		C/C-

IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and
good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that
'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he
was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last
year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.

#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade:		B+

After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp
before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not
particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,
proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most
reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.
Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73
games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.

#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B-

Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,
partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed
even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;
that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if
he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.

#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft
Grade:		I (A)

At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),
Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury
in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),
but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),
which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still
susceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back
from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.

#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).
He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to
become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.

I am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game, but Tod Hartje,
who played for Harvard in college and then went on to play in the AHL
(initially for Moncton and currently for Providence-- thanks to Daryl 
Turner for the update!) appeared on David Letterman's show about two
years ago now.

Tod has the distinction of being the first American born player to go 
and play in the former Soviet Union. This was arranged by Jets GM Mike 
Smith while Tod was playing in Moncton at about the time all those 
European players were coming over to North America to play in the NHL.

Tod spent a year playing in Russia and played with or against some of
the Russian players who have just entered the NHL in the last two years.
He wrote a book on his experiences called ""Behind the Red Line"" (check it
out!) and appeared on the Letterman show to talk about them.

-- Mike 

Note: I hope I have my facts straight. It has been a year since I
read Tod's book. I wanted to dig the book out to double check, but 
realized I lent it to a friend, and he hasn't returned the book yet!

I'll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as
Bure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they
won't even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make
it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be
doing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on
Saturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the
Smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals).

1st round: 
----------

PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4. 

It looks like a safe bet.  NYI has been bagging it of late.
NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour
of Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4.

WASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. 
I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with
WASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.

BOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. 
The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last
two weeks.  The only question is how long will it last?
Fuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4.

QUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7.
It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry.
The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.  

CHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. 
STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4.

DET  vs TOR:  DET in 6.
I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs
offense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they
turn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last
couple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.
I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,
DET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.

VAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.

Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.
There is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.
WIN in 6.

CAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.
Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does
not watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.
CAL in 4.


2nd round: 
----------

PITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. 
It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their
saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.
However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little
too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,
I will say PITT in 6.

BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.
MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.
The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the
B's.  B's in 6.


CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.
Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine
of late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played
like killers.  DET in 6.

WIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.
CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out
muscle WIN.  CAL in 5.

3rd round: 
----------

PITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. 

I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over
and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may
be something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.
CHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. 

Finals:
------

PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. 

NO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say
here.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go
with goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7.

No.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation.]

Don't give up so soon.  A lot of Burgh fans didn't give up at 3-1 last year.
You gotta believe!  (Hard as that may seem)  With the Caps with the #1 power
play in the playoffs and #1 penalty killing (according to Mike Lange) all
the Caps have to do is make sure it doesn't go OT...as that was Boston's and
Chicago's demise.  OT can be a curse.

I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,
Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.
All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?

The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was
Lapointe.

Heh, someone mentioned Tommy Soderstrom (Flyers) for the besk mask poll
too (in the mentioned below part).  All he has is a plain white helmet
with a big cage.
I found this pretty amusing.

If I'm not mistaken, San Jose had more wins than Ottawa. First tiebreaker in
the NHL is always most wins.

I'm not sure about Juha, but another top center, Rauli Raitanen([ss{t)
is drafted by Jets. Raitanen had very good year and he has played in the
Finnish nationalteam. I believe that he'll be one of the best finns in
this year's WC, if Matikainen(Head coach) elects him to the team.

            I am sorry to tell you this Greg, but in all
            reality, we cannot see Vancouver winning the
            cup.  They have a rrally good chance to come
            out of the Smythe Division, and a chance to make 
            it to the finals, but no one is capable this year
            of beating the Penguins, they have too many
            scoring threats. I would love to be proven wrong, but
            I must conclude that the Pens will win cup 3 this year.

On the other hand, I'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
Fereirra made.  Imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight.

Let's say that in the view of the Sharks' upper management, the attempt
to trade Kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire Feirerra.
I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept
him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (Wonder what
sacrifice he made to the Muse of Fax?  (His job, I guess.))

have fun

And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you 
another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:

I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes
for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why?
Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)

Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:

NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM

Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.

Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)
Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)

These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off
in PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:

Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)

What an honor.

I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and
Carpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from 
behind to take the title:

NHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIM
Igor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)
Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)
Rob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)


It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.

I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the
series.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal
(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely
(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one
of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.

Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or
does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!

Final

>Will Bruin domination continue in this rivalry? Yes. Moog has

I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for
6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play
in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear
territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will
not be putting money on this series. :-)

>Patrick Division, semifinal

>Pittsburgh vs. NY Islanders:
>What can I say? The Pens are flying high and have the most talent in
>the league. 

Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent
of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is
credit to NY.

>Washington vs. New Jersey:
>CAPITALS IN 5.

Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent
team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.

>Pittsburgh vs. Washington:
>If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset, but Don Beaupre
>just doesn't inspire my hopes.  PENGUINS IN 6.

I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't
think it will go six either...*maybe* five.

>CONFERENCE FINAL:
>Pittsburgh vs. Boston:
>A replay of last year. The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago,
>and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.

If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They
own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once
again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the
Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.

>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal

>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):
> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.

Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,
IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.

>Detroit vs. Toronto:
>The Leafs have had an excellent season, but they've been playing
>playoff hockey all year - the Habs under Burns were the same way and
>always wilted in the playoffs.  RED WINGS IN 5.

Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out
why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three 
at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.

>FINAL:
>Chicago vs. Detroit:
> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.

It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. 
And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.

>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:

>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:
> CANUCKS IN 7.

Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their
size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team
chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.

>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:

This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. 
I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a
non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate
Gretzky.  LA in six.

>FINAL:
>Vancouver vs. Calgary:
> FLAMES IN 6.

If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be
LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.

>COFERENCE FINAL:
>Detroit vs. Calgary:
> RED WINGS IN 7.

Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked
LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.

>STANLEY CUP FINAL:
>Pittsburgh vs. Detroit:

If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet
against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong
because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,
though, I'd have to take the Penguins.

A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than
Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from
the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.
I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while
he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),
Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.
from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best
all-round players in the NHL.

  ESPN had an advertise for Pens/Devils game 4. I don't know what the hell

Bleep! Bleep! Bleep!  The Bruins lost AGAIN in O.T.  I can't stand it!

Aside from frustrated ravings, I must give Buffalo credit: they are making good 
on most of their scoring opportunities, and are playing great defense.  Boston
players can't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the Buffalo net
except for on rare occasions.  The Buffalo defense is also doing an excellent
job clearing away rebounds.  Fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed
but he's also getting plenty of help.
Boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the 
series score of 3-0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the 
game.  As a result, Boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period
2 goals down.  This MUST stop if Boston is to have any hope of winning a single
game (the outlook for the Bruin's advancement to the second round are quite
bleak).  IMHO, the Bruins NEED to score first.  If they can do that, they have
an excellent chance of winning, since they have outplayed the Sabres in the 
2nd and 3rd periods.

(The scary thing is that I'll be going to grad school in Buffalo next year.
   I'll never cheer for the Sabres... You can't convert me... ^:)

Hmmmm, I'm not sure this is true.  According to Mike Lang and good old
Stagie, along with the rest of the TV crews in pittsburgh, they 
winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark.
I would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular
season games.

However, you are right that the playoff streak does carry over from
last year.  And with 1 more win, I believe they tie an Edmonton record
(but don't quote me on that one).

Not nearly as angry as I was to have set the VCR yesterday only to get
home to find the Bruins VS Buffalo - that's what I get for reading the
TV section and not the sports section for what game will be aired.

  An interesting note ... I have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.
  I picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and
  then never touched the roster again.  I got wrapped up in my own ""money"" pool
  and decided not to get involved at all with the USENET pool (sorry Andrew
  btw).  The only thing I remember about my team is that I had Joe Sacco and
  maybe John MacLean.  Maybe Francis and Kevin Stevens as well.  Out of
  curiousity I checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my
  amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to
  finsh 79th!  I'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me
  :)

  Ciao.

Picture if you will, the Habs going into the last couple minutes of the
game, leading 2-0.  The Nords get a power play, pull Hextall, and get
a goal.  Bout a minute later, they get another one.  Then they win in
overtime......

A bad dream?.......

Add Boston's WEEI-590AM as the Bruins' flagship station. You probably won't
pick it up anywhere outside of Boston since it's only a 5,000 watt
station. The Bruins also have network stations in all 6 New England
states.

This could be the Bruins' last year on 'EEI which also happens to be an
all-sports radio station. The problem is that the Bruins are not too happy
being moved over to a different station(WMEX 1150AM) whenever there
is a the same-night conflict with the NBA's Boston Celtics. This happened
28 times during the course of the regular season.(The Celtics own financially
troubled WEEI). The Bruins might resurface on WHDH 850 next year. Stay
tuned.

 1993 World Championships in Germany:
 ====================================

 Group A results:

 SWEDEN - CANADA  1-4 (0-0,1-1,0-3)

 1st:
 2nd: CAN 0-1 Geoff Sanderson      (Kevin Dineen)                  7:24
      SWE 1-1 Patrik Juhlin        (Jan Larsson)                  15:23 (pp)

      CAN 1-3 Mike Gartner         (Greg Johnson,Adam Graves)     10:44 
      CAN 1-4 Rod Brind'Amour      (Shayne Corson)                19:59

 Canada     10 13  6 - 29     6*2min

 Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well
 played game.

 The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and
 Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding
 Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom 
 played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
 Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge
 to Sweden in creating more opportunities.
 Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi
 made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but
 Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada
 started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked
 hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson
 who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and
 made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.
 The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot
 that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.
 Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took
 a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by
 the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.
 Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure
 but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.
 At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to
 cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.
 That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in 
 the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he
 explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close
 to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.
 Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a
 bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas
 then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.
 The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a
 rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds
 in the dressing room.

 A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing
 great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better
 than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best
 goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.
 Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is
 easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,
 Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.

 The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-
 Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the
 task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.
 Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering
 that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very
 well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because
 of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake
 on the 1-3 goal.

 The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd
 showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.

 FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)

 1st:

 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26

 Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min
 Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia
 Attendance: 2,800

 I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the
 whole game). The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the
 blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter.
 As far as the play in the second period goes, the Finns seemed to have the
 most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it.

 I know that there wasn't other games on the schedule, but ESPN sometimes
shows classic games from previous season to fill in the time slot.

Trashy move from a trashy organization. After the front
office stated that nobody would lose their job over the
Sens. poor performance, Bridgeman is gone within 24 hours
of the teams final game.

Yes...I know he screwed up letting the King's grab Loach.

Sexton's qualifications (aside from being cheap)??

	- he played some US college hockey,
	- he's pals with club president Bruce Firestone.

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build
an expansion franchise. He'll probably be in the Hall of
Fame next year! :-)

This continues a tradition of front office gaffs:
- Paul Anka and the arena deal
- Denis Potvin and the GM postion
- Mike Bossy and the scoring coach.

How do people in Ottawa feel about how the club is being run??

Subject: SHARKS REVIEW Part 1: Goaltenders
Organization: Computer Science Department, Stanford University.
Lines: 80

As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,
trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through
for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will
have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can
kill them.

I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,
are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as
possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks
and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.

Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...

#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th
Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		P (D)

It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that
featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and
'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this
year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would
not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.

But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first
ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.
As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.

#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft
Grade:		C

Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply
wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,
almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save
percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry
the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,
but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next
year.

#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)
Acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent
Grade:		I (A-)

It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the
incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary
Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started
the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'
owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP
honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs
Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up
all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can
share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor
Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he
may not ever.

#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B+

I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting
the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.
He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and
making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the
goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.

As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a  player
who was born in Canada but now has a German passport). 
Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
for Germany in the WC.

The other Canada-born forwards are:
	Peter-John Lee (has British passport)
	Chris Valentine
	Dale Dercatch
	Steve Gootas
 	Earl Spry (?)

At the moment there are only three German-born forwards coming into my mind:
	Bernd Trunschka, Andreas Brockmann, Ernst Koepf

I couldn't get the Leaf games on the weekend in CA.

Did the Leaf defense wise up overnight?
Did the Leafs get in the slot or 
was it just ""fluke"" goals in a goalie duel? 
Did the Wings turn off the jets or muscle?  
What gives here?

I caught game 1 on satellite.  I figured my Leafs were washed.
This is a _major_ turnaround.   Very few predicted this. 
How, how, how did it happen?

But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Everywhere else, the only
reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts.
And local baseball pre-empted the NHL playoffs. Thus far into this
playoff season, ESPN/ABC has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game)
than SportsChannel did (0 games).

If people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet the
ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet. Next week, there
will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.

Someone in this thread said that he wouldn't watch the games even if

Implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against Winnipeg with Selanne

Knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding Selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

Don't let this confuse anybody.  The Winnipeg Jets have never won the
Stanley Cup (or even come that close).  These Stanley Cup championships
go back a LONG way to about the turn of the century.  The Winnipeg
Victorias won one or more of these Cups- the Jets didn't win any of
them.

Can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff
series going on today than who won more Stanley Cups around the turn
of the century??

Lets face facts.  The Canucks are leading the series 3-1.  The Canucks
dominated the Jets in their season series.  The Canucks did better in
the regular season than Winnipeg.  Who is the better team?  I think
that the facts show that Vancouver is better than Winnipeg.

	It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   From what i 
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... 
(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare 
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...
And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...

BTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey....

Have no fear, Doug, the Bruins are toast. Statistically, only 2 teams 
in **all** the Stanley Cup series ever played have come back to win. 
And it couldn't have happened to a nicer team, with all the crowing 
from Boston fans I've had to endure over the last month.

Really?  What makes you think the Islanders have a better shot?  They
couldn't even beat the Whalers in two games!

(Well, since you're a Pens fans the whole question is moot.  I think
the teams most likely to beat the Pens are the Bruins, Nordiques, and
Blackhawks but I don't think they can really do it.  :-))

That's why we have expansion - to create more jobs. NHL teams can't afford to
import role players from Europe, they pick the stars but will continue to build
their teams around local players.

I'd *LOVE* to see a European NHL division but can't see it happen for some
time. There's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
""crucial"" markets like Germany, Italy and France while Sweden and Finland
probably can't afford to shell out $20-$30 for tickets the way
American/Canadian fans do. Call it ""the Minnesota North Stars"" effect:
Scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local, inexpensive
hockey to the NHL. The National Hockey League should love the idea, though.
Pan-European TV channels such as Eurosport could bring in the millions the
American networks likely never will pay.

It is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of
disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  Have simply been too
damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  You can
be sure, however, that I will somehow manage to find time to woof if 
the Leafs give just cause. 

And let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the
subject headers.  I, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form
of notoriety.

One thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the Leafs are the
best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 
games.

The only reason ESPN showed that hockey came was because there was no

Personality means something to me.  That is exactly why I like Clement
(and Emrick).  On the other hand, JD is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant
know-it-all.  He's a real turn-off (which is exactly what I do when he's
on).  One complaint I do have about Clement is that he sometimes talks
too much.  If I wanted that I'd listen to Tim McGarver doing a baseball
game.

    Don't be so sure, the Blues played the Hawks pretty well this season,
and won twice at the Stadium. The Blues will give the Hawks a hard time.
This series is one of the best first round matchups, could go either way.
The Hawks will probably prevail in seven games.

  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at 
the end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league 
didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The 
Stars recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., to replace Churla.

The above is courtesy of The Washington Times on-line service.

Now, here's where I need help.  If anyone out there has a tape of Tuesday's
Chicago-Minnesota game, please contact me.  Terms will be favorable.

Also, if anyone can tape tonight's Minnesota-Detroit game, please contact

Don't you Americans study history...the French settled in North America
as early or before the British...Lemieux can probably trace back his
North American heritage back a lot further than most of us.

But I have to agree.. Boston is a good team..  But streaky...  They put
together a great streak to capture first place in the Adams, but for what?

They have lost the home ice advantage for at least the first round, and might
not make it out of it.

I would love to see the Sabres win the first round, even though I bet on the
Bruins (a 12-pack).  

Oh well, perhaps I should start betting against the Sabres more often! ;-)

Organization: Post Office, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA
Lines: 29
NNTP-Posting-Host: po2.andrew.cmu.edu


I knew, despite the lack of a full game telecast last week, it was still
too much hockey for Atlanta. Atlanta's ABC has declined to pick up any
playoff games till May9. And even when they show the games on MAy9 and May16,
they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. I know this
is still a better situation compared to rest of Georgia, Alabama, etc., but
it is still pretty annoying. At least in PIttsburgh, we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.


I asked them what their problem was. I told them that a local 1.9 rating was
not that bad considering it was the first NHL game shown after a long time
without much promotion. Besides, their syndicated programming in the afternoon
is usually low rated. So what did they have to lose by showing NHL playoffs.
She told me that they had contractual obligations. I asked her if golf
was shown oin ABC, would contractual obligations come in the way. And how come
contractual obligations didn't come in the way of last week's telecast? She
then couldn't give me a coherent answer.


Also, I added that Atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game
attendances and that the demographics were good. I think ABC and other networks
should begin to tie their high rated programs like Roseanne in with
 thier sports programming.
I hope that everyone in Atlanta who reads this bboard calls WSB 2 and complain
bitterlyt about this. Tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts
since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.

The lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. Sometimes, the reason
is low ratings. Then another time, she says contractual obligations.

Yeah, they finally came to agreement on a contract. As soon as the ink was
dry, he suddenly decided Kansas City was a neat place to be. (ergo, the
""want to play for the national team"" was a bargaining chip).

Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion
at the hands of a truly crappy owner.

Hopefully the NHL will install an expansion franchise in the Twin Cities
within the next five years.  Even if this is the case, a lot has been
lost in the North Stars move...

Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a
documentary on ""Ice Hockey in Harlem"".  the Canadian Club of New York
(something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on
the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  All playing
with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  It
looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else.

Some of the kids were even fortunate to get a trip to a hockey camp in Alberta.

Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much.  About 4
or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex; it went something
like [sarcastically]:

""Yep, Patty's the man.  He's responsible for the team's success...I'm a 
nobody around here.""

I was going to post it at the time...I must have forgot since nobody else 
was talking about him being a problem.

Yep, I'd beat the shit out of him too.  LaFontaine really must be a team
player...makes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking.
My question is what the hell is Muckler doing?  Whether he wishes to admit it
or not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the
job should be given to somebody who can.  

Gee, kinda like Alex's spot on the team, isn't it?

I would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me, so I can put these stats on the archive
site.  Contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

Here are the individual goalie stats as of: Wed Apr 21 09:09:38 CST 1993

These stats include games up to and including the Sunday previous to the date
listed above.  They have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every Tuesday.  They don't print shots and save percentage numbers, so those
are not verified.  These stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends, if I'm in town and I can get late game results.  Just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail.

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, let me know.

	Yeah, the news is true...the Leafs lost to the Wings 6-3.
Wish I could say I'd seen the whole game but my husband wanted
to watch ""Young Guns II"" on another channel. Sometime between
the first time I tuned in and d saw the Leafs tie and the next time
I tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened.
	Please no woofing from Red Wings fans.  They're my third
favourite team, and if they make it past the Leafs I'll wish them
luck.  As for Potvin...well, it WAS his fist playoff game.

open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's 
Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two 
teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the 
old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, 
located directly across the street, opens.
  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report 
following a trade with Edmonton.

 Edmonton Oilers
  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug 
Weight.
  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.
  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with 
Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the 
city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to 
administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner 
Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has 
threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no 
money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat 
Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce 
significant revenues for other owners.
  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the 
remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.

 Hartford Whalers
  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.

her outfits as ""very hot"" and ""very sexy,"" once slapped her hand as she 
was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it 
through a client's hair.
  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, 
announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for 
their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.
  The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it 
wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last 
home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must 
pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team's late rent payment for 1992, 
which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take 
property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine.
**
  Derian Hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars' last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the 
end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn't 
rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars 
recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., to replace Churla.

 Montreal Canadiens
  Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league 
defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.

 New Jersey Devils
**
  Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis 
Morel after the Devils' 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.  Nicholls was 
ejected by Morel for being the third man in on a fight late in the second 
period of that game and afterward Nicholls called Morel ""a homer"" and ""an 
embarrassment to the referee's association.""

 New York Islanders
  Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft 
choice.

 New York Rangers
  Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight.
  Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay

1-800-881-2639

downtown Tampa if the delay-plagued company that holds a lease from the

**
  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta 
Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be 
a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the 
first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six 
goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After 
the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to 
compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East 
Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor 
league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
**
  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that 
the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the 
Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning 
general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that 
the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are 
exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But 
Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  ""We were disappointed 
with ESPN's irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said.  ""There is just no 
substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years 
regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to 
build a new arena.

championship, gave up his final year of eligibility and signed a contract

assist in a 5-4 loss to Toronto.

- Draft news:

        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in 
June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen.
        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down 
from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.
        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.
        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total 
of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams.
        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst 
records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry 
Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 
1994.

        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 
1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a 
delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.

        In March of '93, the two regular-season division champions from

  Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early 
November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local 
interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 
salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players 
are not limited to three years in the league.
  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-
94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron 
confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under 
consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking

 - Major League Hockey
 
        A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States 
and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced 
Wednesday, February 10.
        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of 
the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New 
Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.
        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams 
playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have 
been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto 
and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.
        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its 
rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''
        Boe said league play will have an international flair and 
discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the 
IIHF.
        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and 
eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.
        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.

 8. Answers to some frequently asked questions:
 
 Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?
 A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in 
and around Montreal. Hence they were called ""Les Habitants"" (natives of 
Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.
 
 Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?
 A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to 
signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer 
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.

 Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?
 A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is 
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)
Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)
 
 Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in 
the NHL?
 A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 
chances.
 
 Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?
 A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when 
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a 
+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-
handed goals do count for +/-.
 
 Q: What is the five-hole?
 A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: 
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower 
right, and (5) five-hole.
 
 Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
 A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven 
series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a 
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

 Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?
 A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever 
to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for 
the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis 
Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat 
Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine 
shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately 
lost the game, 6-4.

 Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?
 A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed 
the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be 
worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.

 Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?
 A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National 
Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey 
League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as 
assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in 
September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell 
University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.

 Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?
 A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and 
Colonial Hockey Leagues.

I used to work for the Stars.  Minnesota supported the team to an
extent.  When I was there, we had quite afew sellouts (This was the
season after the cup run and during the finals).  Norm's main bitch was
that there wasn't enough luxury suites.  And, the ones he had were not
always full.  He wanted more boxes and wanted them full.  He was just
asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games
at High Schools for $5 or college for about $10 that would probably be
better.

What really irritated me was that they kept switching back and forth
between baseball and hockey after they stated that they couldn't show
the overtime period. I turned back to ESPN around 11 and it was hockey.
Great, I pulled up a chair and watched, then the first overtime period 
ended and they went back to baseball before coming back to hockey
something like 30 minutes later. Are they trying to alienate both
hockey and baseball viewers at the same time. As for Martinsville,
I wonder why they even bothered to sign up for it when they it was
no secret that it coincided with the draft. Why not let TNN broadcast
it ?

	Ah, so now we're into European player bashing?  What next?  
No more French Canadiens?  Yeah, there's an idea!  Let them French-
speaking Canadiens have their own hockey league!  We don't want them!
	Are you _CRAZY_?  The NHL is one of the true international
leagues, and yes, there _ARE_ many Europeans who deserve to play in
the NHL and are better than some North Americans, look at Teemu!!!
I, for one, am glad to see Europeans in the NHL and I hope the
NHL soon expands to Europe.  Its nice to see all these different
people come together to form the (soon to be) 26 hockey teams.

That is what my point really was. There is not straight dependency between

According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest

Again, according to TSN, virtually everything that Peter Puck has already

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players
such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses.

I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  
I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has ""sucked"" revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.
Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or

I was wondering if any Star Trek TNG fans in this newsgroup knew of a
possible relationship between the Bruins' players Douris & Moog and the
Klingon names Duras and Worf (Son of Moog). I suppose it's a coincidence.

Just curious,

Lori, the regular Penguins poster here on rec.sport.hockey, indicated to me
via e-mail that on the nights that Pirates baseball and Penguins playoff 
games coincide, the Pens will be covered on WDVE FM (102.5).

This is WJR in Detroit and it's 760 AM. However, as I neglected to mention in

WLLZ FM (98.7).

Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd
take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1
netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than
that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records
are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as
the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.

You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well
be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in
those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,
the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.

But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play
for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just
my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that
about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm
batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.

As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the
save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't
get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's
what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him.

> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie

I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on
opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending
champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a
Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are
part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.

Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and
I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current
7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I
don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any
tickets next season:-).

"Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff News
From: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca
Organization: Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta
Lines: 118

News:
=====
For the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player
remaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not 
a major part of the team. 

Trent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season
game against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has
also scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. 

Thoughts on Game 1:
==================

The Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with
Los Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing
big hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that
was the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and 
try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky
Kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames
conducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren
Fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren
Rychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. 

Goaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the
loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got
very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and 
sweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off
Chris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. 

Thoughts on Game 2:
==================

The Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the
potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.
The first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary
came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring
five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. 

The deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary
dominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better
use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary
also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up
a shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the
game with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when
they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. 

The Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he
was leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie
Huddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. 

The game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of
Calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for
instigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato
drew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed
30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct
for hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a
fight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and
Yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil 
turtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at 
each other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)

The Fat Lady is about to hit the first note...Okay,how about 3-0 deficits?
The B's chances for a comeback are now less 1%(That's based on 7-game

He got the start but the headlines on all Boston local TV sportscats
said it all : ""Sutter Blue It!"". And he did.

Harry Sinden's appearance outside of B's dressing room after Game 3
was a pathetic site. He said something really retarded to cover Sutter's
behind,""This game is not about winning or losing.."". Harry,check the
schedule! Your team is in the playoffs and about to go on a long summer
vacation on Sunday morning!

Harry and his buttkisser Milbury will never admit that they screwed up
in a major way when they brought in one of the dumbest people in the
business,Brian Sutter. Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.Louis
speaks for itself. The Blues really have a chance to advance to the
second round this year...

Gaetz won't be back. There's been rumors he was officially released right at
the end of the season when his contract expired, but I haven't seen
confirmation. It was clear from my talks with the Sharks doctors that he
wasn't going to make it for a while, and the Sharks would have to sign him
to a contract, which given his problems competing at the IHL level this
spring, doesn't make sense.

Gerald, the Alberta election is slated fou 7 June, unless something RE?ALLY goes

Gerald, don't blame Sather.  This battle between the peole and Pocklington
started in 1986 and got WORST when Pocklington sold Gretzky.  

There were days when you can shake the hand of Pocklington when he was
respectalbe( I use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are GOE!!

Well, if things were different and I had my way, the headline would be: ""NHL,
European Division regular season game: Stockholm Storm vs. Helsinki Tornado
4-3..."" Two games against every North American-based team (46 in all), and this
might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between Helsinki
and Stockholm. The remaining 27 games would involve Paris, Dortmund, Milan...
A nice dream.

I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isles
wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles.
Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a
bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick 
scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there
and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's
gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting
stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!

As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either
makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck 
towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't
stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or 
committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!

As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.
Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first
round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they
should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal
game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead
they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive
shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he
can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got
to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kind
of young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!

This is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism

this nonsense...making fun of names??  It's bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players, but he's now resorted to making fun
of their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video
until he dropped the gloves...

>On the subject of realignment, Don said that he liked the

Well, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite
some time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division
names.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or so....he also invited the audience to ""Name the teams in the Wales...quick,
quick!"" Followed by ""Ah, you don't know, I don't know....""  

Sorry Don.  Wrong on this one.

>Ron (to Don): ""I don't know wy I like you on your show

This was absolutely hilarious.

Don's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity,
has he?

Don's question to Gretzky:

>Wouldn't it be better

Here we are with the Sabres up 2-0 to the Bruins and the Sabres' farm
team, the Rochester Amerks, on their way to the Calder Cup (urp!) and
what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? The same Penguins/Devils
every other day crap that everyone else gets. What's worse, the
SportsChannel coverage of the Islanders appears to be blocked out,
since we got CBA basketball last night, if you can believe it.  I
assume the Sabres are demanding the SC blackout, not ESPN, since we
are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the Islanders territory
(MSG coverage of the Rangers is blacked out here). This despite being
a solid seven hours plus from Long Island.

Does anyone know what GRC is doing, besides putting their satellite

Please.  Have a care with Phil.  We liked him a lot in Pittsburgh.  He
didn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his
butt off.  It was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive
zone that allowed the Pens to utilize his potential.  I haven't been
paying attention to him this year so I can't say I know what you're 
objecting to.  He has been out with injuries though, hasn't he?  And
if the offense isn't there, there's not much his speed will do for you.
Like I said, he created opportunities but he didn't score much.  I thought
the money offered from the Rangers was a little high, and so did the Pens,
I guess.

+/- is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores a
lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.
It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the
same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally
good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare
between players on different teams.

I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful
are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is
a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring
the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a
better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice
time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low
amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who
doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of
quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that
thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than
+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.

+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.
You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see
that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed
is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.

Major league baseball has told the Blue Jays and the Expos not to
sign Oscar Linares (I think that is his name)
...Canada does not have the restrictions against
Cubans that the US has and other major league teams have told the
Canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the Expos or the
Blue Jays would do this.  Cubans players would not have to defect
to play in Canada and could play the 81 home games for the Expos

Information Director - Eric Kolb

Each team is owned by the league, with local intrests controlling day to
day operations.  Working agreements and NHL affiliations are up to each
team.

Each team has a $100,000 salary cap for 17 total players
(16 dress up).

Each team is limited to 11 visas, meaning at least 6 players must be
Americans (Ignore this rule if you are Tulsa, they only had 2 Americans
on the roster during the playoffs).

Teams play in Wichita, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Memphis, Fort Worth, and Dallas.

Future expansion plans include Houston, San Antonio, Baton Rouge, Little Rock,
El Paso, Albuquerque, Tuscon, and Amarillo.  Austin is a possibility if Dallas
has to move.  Houston and San Antonio are in for this fall, with Baton Rouge
and Little Rock likely for 94-95.

My votes (FWIW):

Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and
Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on
the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess
I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.

Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+
points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew
Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and
Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, 
although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the
right side.

Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,
since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).
Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded
the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his
way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left
to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the 
Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar
after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of
competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only
seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row.

MLB is perfectly willing to take players from Cuba.  They just have to
defect first.  

Sort of like the situation used to be with Russian/Czech/etc hockey
players, until the political situation in those countries changed.

Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall.

If Gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as Gainey was, then yeah,
I would have to say that Doug wasn't playing ""technically"" smart 
hockey.  In any case, to claim as Greg did, that Gainey *never* made 
a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.

Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to

I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at 
all.

Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
around.  Who would you rather have as your ""checking"" centre?  Doug
Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my ""checking"" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey? 

>any team.  The Selke is designed to acknowledge their

You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
sively.

Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel
prize then I suggest that you had best ""settle down"".  And if you are
going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you ""settle 
down"" before you bother following up on my postings.

That's not inner calm.  It's boredom, and it's being spoiled.  The Arena's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year; too many of us just
take winning for granted.  It's been seemingly forever since the team
lost, and we've forgotten what it's like to feel real excitement and

While I'm glad to have the Pens doing so well, in some ways it was a better

NNTP-Posting-Host: andrew.cmu.edu

During the first three games of the Pens-Devils series, I have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the Pens.  Jagr,
MacEachern and Barrasso have been especially fun to watch.  But, one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be Scotty Bowman.

Despite Brooks' lunatic comments, and despite the Devils' line changing
adantage in last night's game, Bowman has been able to keep his cool and
keep the Devils in the dark.  Granted, the hell-dwellers had the Pens
bottled up for a while last night, but Bowman was eventually able to
configure his line-up to get the job done.  His ability to throw out new
looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.

Bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an
individual basis.  Last night, for instance, he realized that the speed
of Jagr, Straka, and MacEachern was throwing the Devils off balance.  As
a result, Straka received many more shifts than average; Jagr played
almost the entire game (he was always on the puck), and MacEachern
scored a goal, while complementing Jagr many times throughout the night.
His ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is
commendable, especially when a coach of such a talented team might
simply rely on the overall talent to dominate, and to bring about
success.

While no one can replace the genius and optimism of Badger Bob Johnson,
Bowman, in his own way, has made himself a permanent, though not clearly
seen, mark in  Pittsburgh.

As I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread
claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. 
Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his
was a ""jingoistic rant"", but you also supported the name-changing on the
grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals
they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I 
think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an 
observation...

However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for
the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.

If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not 
central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to
play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to
builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although
it was the chicken.....)

Dunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable, since it doesn't look as though

Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure
they deserve and MVP (""can't win without him"").  However, I'd suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for
the All-Star game notwithstanding.

As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't
really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on
the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent
numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league
oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.
I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.

As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or
even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.

Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just
barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an
awful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well
off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in

Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style

I don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn't

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your

Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.
(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted).

Would European fans put up with our ""if you've paid, you can play"" 
attitude??

How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based 
corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).

If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth 
division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like
Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would 
eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can
dream, can't I??)

Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fan
problems).

He's been out, but he isn't injured.  He played well when he was put into the lineup at the end of the season - Murray has to sit somebody out, though.  If the Red Wings hadn't played as well as they did in the first game, he may have been in the second.  Why should Murray juggle players when the Wings are dominating Toronto like they are?

Here is something crossposted from the AHL mailing list:			

In a discussion between me and Chris Lerch, the subject of Springfield's 
1st round upset of the Providence Bruins
came up. Chris basically raised the possibility that the AHL 
hierarchy is biased in favor of the Indians. He noted that the offices
for the league are in Spring. and many ex-Indians are working for the AHL.
Furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the Cup 
finals between Roch and Spring, that the Amerks charged favoritism by the office
and that:

""...there were little questionable things liket he AHL president and
staff attending all games with the Springfield brass, including sitting
in their box for the game in Springfield and, according to the Rochester
media, openly cheering for Springfield.""

Certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this
is true. I don't know if this is anything more than whining on the
part of the Amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the
Wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises
questions about President Jack Butterfield's leadership.

You know, you're absolutely right.  I think we should round up all those

see, with whom should we start?  I dunno, Lemieux?  Hmmm...sounds like he

I don't think it would be hard to find some Native Americans (or Native
Canadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of *ours.*  Ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all*
immigrants of some sort.  If you really don't think that Mogilny, Bure,
Selanne, et al have improved the NHL, then I'm not sure you understand the
game.

Finland will be 4th of pool B and will most certainly meet Canada in the

As long as a player is under contract to an organization, he is obligated to
play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission
to play. The Rangers are certainly within their rights to force Zubov and
Andersson to report to Binghampton. 

It certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the Ranger 
organization, however. Is having Binghampton win the Calder Cup really more
important to them than keeping their players happy?

Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be
like without Recchi for 30 games.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring
ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.

Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42
points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor
in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as
a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.

My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,
but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest
disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any
coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.

OK, ""this ain't North America"" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city
having a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course,
Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small
distances between cities but still. 

> Germany      : Dusseldorf, Cologne, Berlin, Munich (Mannheim, Rosenheim)

Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one
of the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about
7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built
unless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. 

> Sweden       : Stockholm, Gothenburg (Malmo, Gavle)

Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has 
5,000 seats I think.

> Finland      : Helsinki (Turku, Tampere)

If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.
Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for
major league hockey.

> Italy        : Milan

...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa

and the smaller cities in the north.

Paris had their own ""Volans Francais""(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.
I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals 
tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for 
attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor 
sport like hockey.

Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning
anyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by

Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger Nielson...Roger needs
players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight
lines up and down the ice.  Dudley and Nielson are the only two coaches
bad enough in the league to take talents like Mogilny and Kovalev and
not know how to turn them into Bure and Selanne.

Get Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.

The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got
players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches
who are interested in ""rope-a-dope"" strategies.  If you want the
Roger Nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and
get a Mark Messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks
from a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players
like Kovalev.

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-
istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the
game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is 
bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being
benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to
attract, that these players are indeed superstars.

It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-
bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-
ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him.

You know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great
final.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry
nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.

Of course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver
scoring the final goal....

Keenan and Messier have always gotten along...Keenan dumped Steve
Yzerman from the last Canada Cup team, even though Yzerman had

I would argue Gerald, that Bowman is the first ""modern"" coach.
Bowman's Canadiens were the first NHL team to have a weight-room
in the 70s.  He is the first coach I have seen, that manipulates
the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (During important games
listen to the pre-game interview will Bowman and compare that to
what is on the ice!)  I agree Bowman is a master of the lineups. 
Remember last year in the SC when he benched Jagr only to set him free 
in OT.  When Jagr banged in the winning goal I thought this was
trademark Bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!

I am left asking ""What is a modern coach if not Bowman?""

I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can
here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.

I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,
THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or
were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging?

As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I

   Well, here it is, NHL in the year 2000.
I got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and 
although I initially thought I had just been taking too many too strong 
drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  You can see the 
league has already started to move to this direction.

   *The Walt Disney Conference*
Anaheim Mighty Chipmunks    -Franchise name to be changed after each new 
LA Kings                      hockey movie         
LA Flames                   -We've seen some of that
San Jose Sharks
San Diego Bruins
Tijuana Red Wings   -Detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry...
Dallas Stars           
Houston Oilers
Texas Rangers
Seattle Canucks

   *The Norm Green Conference*
Alabama White Hawks
Biloxi Blues
Tampa Bay Lightning
Miami Blades
Helsinki Jets        -You've heard them starting getting used to the anthem
Montreal Quebecois (sp?)                 -There will be no 'Canada'
Atlanta Devils
Orlando Penquins
Key West Islanders
Hartford Whalers                        The Whalers will never move, huh?
Palm Beach Capitals

  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe
the rest of the 'message'.  I'm sure the future will turn you into believers 
too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool 
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can 
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the 
game in their back yards !

         I hope I'm just out of my mind.
        There won't REALLY be a Disney team in Anaheim, will there?
        The Stars aren't REALLY moving...

Summary: UMass hires Head Coach for first season since 1979
Keywords: UMass Minutemen Mallen
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]



The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday
afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former
Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year
contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. 

Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson
(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for 
the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of
Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.

UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had
undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November
of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following
its one year construction deadline. 

The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this
upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994
season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or
potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will
leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and
Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.

UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; 
expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.

Subject: Panther's President
Organization: Cybernet BBS, Boca Raton, Florida
Lines: 46

As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.
After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.

A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_
Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders.
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.

The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price 
information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the
day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and
GM.

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.

""The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,"" Torrey said.  
""Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.""

More BIO:
In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight
seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-
offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.

""I guess this completes my own personal hat trick"", said Torrey, 58, a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach.

The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being
down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady
defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play
philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like
Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too
many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If
last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole
championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is
to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the
last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury
suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for
the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an 
Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game
against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third
period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game
winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity
for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just
like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!

Not boring is right!!! It is more likely to cause me to have a stroke!!
I had to listen to game two on the Blackhawk station and I don't think I
could take another call of ""And JOSEPH makes a SPEcTACular saaaaaave"".
Now I'm a Blues fan, but I don't want them to play ""like"" they played
in game two. Sure the result was fine, but the Blues match up very well
with the Hawks so they really don't need to treat them like the 86 Flames.
We don't need a ""Monday Night Miracle"" to have a chance to beat Chicago.
The Blues can do it on talent. At least over the hawks.

Toronto, will not last long.  (Keep in mind this is only a predicition).  
Wendall will have to get into the game however otherwise Probert will

Bowman is the genius...Johnson isn't.  Bowman is a great coach...Johnson,
a very good one.  However, Bowman is really not a modern coach, and
Patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and
delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on Patrick's part.

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with;
it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds
from CBC (-;).  It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack
of it, that we're complaining about.  They had rights to two OT's
that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and
they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in
desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.

Grrrr, let's start a whole 'nother topic on show bad the sharks are doing on
these things. I swear that ALL of my partial plan games were televised (I
know, I'm exaggerating, but...).
In order:
-the new ticket prices suck
-wait 'till people try to park at games next year. Public transit? Yeah
right, I'd love to take caltrain for 3 hours to see a 3 hour game.

Shelling out hundreds of dollars for partial season plans for two years
doesnt mean anything to the sharks, as I get to pick my seats after the dead
rise from their graves to claim their seats! :-)

After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as
possible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shots
this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders). I've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. Just
as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the
head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens
(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of
course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match
penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few
years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also
very good.

How about that Tocchet head-butt? Is there an automatic susppension that
goes along with a (non-kicking) match penalty? I can't remember anymore.

Oh, the playoffs should be fun,

And of course, Mike Ramsey was (at one time) the captain in Buffalo prior to

and 1 real captain (Lemieux) playing for them.  They rotate the A's during the

Subject: Isles / Hockey Ramblings
Lines: 43


	Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. 
The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles
beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.

	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in
general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders 
back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that 
the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,
come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty 
wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played 
a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL 
debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this 
guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a 
Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot 
correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?

	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick
Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey
talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. 
Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a
defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. 
This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such ""enforcers""?  Not
only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a 
good fight once in a while, but only when it's ""called for"".  You know, when a
guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of ""hockey ethics""
might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. 
I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the
referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,
not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. 
If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.

This is incorrect.  This year the Pens had 61 games on ""free"" TV and 6
games on PPV.  Next year they will have 62 games on free TV and 22 on 
a subscription basis.  

You actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be no
more ""radio-only"" games.

Its a good deal.  Last year, everybody bitched about Baldwin ""breaking
up the team"".  Now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this
team together and that takes money.  He comes up with a creative way
to generate more revenue so he can afford this team, and people bitch
some more.

Everybody wants something for nothing.

I've sold one, but I still have 2 left for sale. I also realize that $45 is
alot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. So if enough
people are interested, I'll break up the set into team sets. I'm not sure
how much for each. It would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then
the people who get the Whalers and Devils (Note, I'm not bagging on these teams
its just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would
be subsidizing the people who want Chicago or Pittsburgh. So I'll have to make
it varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.

Can the Sabres win two more games against the Bruins?

I think game three in Buffalo will be the most important of the
series.  If the Sabres lose that game, the party will be over.  It will 
be hello next year.

The key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can
keep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by 
the Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.

Finally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.

In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is
in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him
to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian
players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners
can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US
that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their
import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would
make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some
that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm
club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on
the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian
players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))
So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in North America.

I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the

players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and
Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to

This is a general question for US readers:

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost
impossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had
an opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because
I'm in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with 
coverage, and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even
locally in the US and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if
the games go into double-OT.

Well, the ""jettison for youth fast"" strategy was his. Also in hindsight, it
didn't work all that well, but I think it was more because it left the
Sharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. It
was the injuries that caused us to fall.

From all indications, it wasn't the ""major"" factor, but the ""last straw"".
There were personality conflicts among Shark management, and disagreements
over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded
vs. kept, but who was being sent to KC. What Ferriera did, if rumors are
right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).

>I'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept
>him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!

I think if they'd kept Ferriera, they would have lost some of their other
management staff. Depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost
Grillo AND Lombardi AND Murdoch over the summer. Frankly, I want to keep
those three. (we may well ahve also lost Kingston, which, of course, is now
a moot point). 

The Sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly
consensual and cooperative. Ferriera wanted to run things his way. There
were conflicts. Ferriera lost. That says nothing about his skills or
accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. 

I think he did some good things for the Sharks, but that he never fit in as
a ""Shark person"". I hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in
Anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey. (but I want the Ducks to be
doormats for a couple of years, so the Sharks succeeed first).

Heh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain.
I'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast 
viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into
the Long Beach GP. =)

Were you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day
""contracts"" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST
show that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to
have their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business,
not your own personal video servant.

Maybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw
ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to
Dodge saying that ""thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS, 
you will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff
like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time
for hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry
games (just one example)

Come on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the
""big three"" overight.

After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard
recently.  This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have
no reason to doubt it either.

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center.

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too
high.

Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if
it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals
aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.

His designated point-getter remarks were not only meant for Lemieux,
but for Gretzky, Bure, etc. etc. .... and he made those particular
remarks last December before Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin's,
and as the Leafs started their second half roll, and before
Gilmour's great season was being recognized by many people.

There's quite a few Wings fans lurking about here, they just tend
to be low key and thoughtful rather than woofers.  I suppose every
family must have a Roger Clinton, though.  But remember (to paraphrase
one of my favorite Star Trek lines), ""if we adopt the ways of the Leaf

    ESPN never committed (and I never saw advertised) to a particular
Thursday game.  They had originally scheduled Bos-Buf, and that was
somehow leaked on this net, but to my knowledge ESPN never publicly
released a schedule until Monday when they announced Pitt-NJ Thursday
and Boston-Buffalo Saturday.

  Buffalo is up 2-0 is the series with Boston, and the reason....Grant Fuhr ?
  Fuhr is playoff hungry, and he's proving once again why they call him
  money goaltender. Fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
  league anymore (Statistically at least), but he's proving that he can
  make the big save at the right time.
  
  The Leafs should have kept Fuhr, and probably would have had a chance 
  against powerhouse Detroit. But again.......where was Andreychoke in game 1 ?

  I can see the huge smile on Gerald's face after Fuhr's performance.

First, I enjoyed reading your post.  Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak
spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has
had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and 
leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of 
respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason 
concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense.

The score is now 6-0. The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils who

throw on my jersey, Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the first
caps game I've been able to watch all season. And what does ESPN do? they
go back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning!

oops excuse me =) goes into his penguin worship mode (Dont freak pens fans!
They are worthy of this! I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much next
year!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh they
were just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission. Good
they've put a close game back on. Wait! WHATS THIS SHIT?!! THEY'RE SHOWING

You think that's bad ... one year, we had all three New York teams in
the playoffs and the cableco operator (SCNY once shared a channel with
BET but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6PM) didn't know what I
was talking about ...

While it's nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces
the same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions
and zero promotion (okay, I don't watch that much TV so I'm just foaming
all right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable
before going to the networks.  In year one of the new ESPN contract, the
saturation coverage of SCA (all other games shown to completion, like
the Quebec-Montreal and Sabres-Bruins overtimes) is missed around here.

weekend will help your case.  :-)  Seriously, this is only a fun pool and
I trust each person to be honest.

Again, sorry for any inconvenience, and I hope the pool is still fun for you.

        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain, this time 
        B.J. McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded.

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see.


        well talk to you later

        Steve

Toronto, to the Cup finals???

First of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?  Al
Morgani (or however you spell the idiot's name) must be from Chicago,
because on ESPN, he said ""it's not even close--Chicago will definatly win
the Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close.""  Everyone is
picking Chicago!  I don't get it, he says it's an ""easy choice""?
God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a
point or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team!
As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they
aren't going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the
Hawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose.
As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings
fan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux,
Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait
til next year.
But hey, these were Paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their own
opinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, I'll
walk to Toronto to get some tickets, and that's a 700 mile walk!  

--Ryan--

Detroit Red Wings--the forgotten team!  Go Wings!!  Let's hope the Penguins
go out
early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my
$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. 
Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!
Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad 
Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,
even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent, IMO.

Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say
what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. 
And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. 
Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The
third goal was EN.

No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.

I think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post -
namely, Quinn taking advantage of a major league bonehead for a GM
in St. Louis.  This trade was an absolutely stupid trade for St. Louis,
and it was not the only stupid trade that this guy made.  We can give
Quinn credit for being an opportunist here.

How do you figure?  Both Vancouver and Detroit did the same thing last year:
They both won their division, they had close to the same number of points,
they both went down 3-1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in 7 games, and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat, with less talent.  (Specifically,
if I remember correctly, third place teams).  How does this make Vancouver
more improved?  Further, if I'm not mistaken, the Wings had more points than
Vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).

I think, as do the owners, that hockey will do well in Miami since there
is a lot of people from the Northeast that spend their winters in
Florida every year. As for the coverage, someone will have to come up
with some money for that since broadcast rights can be expensive!

	Was the ABC coverage of the Kings/Flames game supposed to be the
way it was shown in BC with CBC overriding the ABC coverage?  When I flipped
to ABC, it was the same commentators, same commercials even.  My question
is:  Was this the real ABC coverage or did CBC just ""black out"" the 
ABC coverage for its own?


	comment:

	CBC had a great chance for some double headers:  Toronto/Detroit
and Vancouver/Winnipeg, but today they said that the East gets the Leafs
and the West get the Vancouver game.  I thought that they would show them
both.

 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a
powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift.
The Wings' lines usually look like this:
 
                      Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli
 
                      Kozlov-Fedorov-Drake
 
                      Kennedy-Burr-Probert

And won't they have to change their name to the ""Steelers"" or something.
The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a  few years back.

Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about
it, what lakes are in L.A.) then I guess the NHL can have the Hamilton Oilers.
