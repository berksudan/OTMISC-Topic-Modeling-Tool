Back in high school I worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
psychologists at Bell Labs.  When they were doing visual perception and
memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
refresh rates common.

So your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.

Many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive I have
which is 3.5"" 600RPM!!

I now have some information on how to modify this for use with a BBC B 
computer. Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm
(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow
for the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also
change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!

Hopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 
quid and upwards ....)

The drive is a JVC MDP series drive ...

I, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  Squirted a fair amount in
an old model 15 Teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  The eruption
when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... I almost got
my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the
platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had
heart attacks.  Beware the explosive properties of WD40 vapor.

Oh dear, time for me to try to remember my chemistry.  Let's see if I
can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind.
<sounds of gears>  <fumes of overheated oil>  <unmistakable stench of
the Nasal Chromatograph>   Ha!  I knew there was a double bond!  Now
how shall I show that in ASCII? 

          MEK:                                 Acetone:

          C - C - C - C                        C - C - C
              #                                    #
              O                                    O

The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond.  MEK has a
methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone
has two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead
is dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think
that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.
It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.

Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.  If you buy
some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need.

WHen trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you 
need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 
resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the 
error of 1% to cope with. 
You have 3 choices;
a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low Q circuits or low 
sensitivity designs
b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (Vishay/Dale)
c) use trimmers or SOT's (Select-On-Test)

The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution.
PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4
is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of
PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.

>What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,
>is exothermic, or energy discharging.

As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).
(More about this later.)

What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:
(we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)
The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things
happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead
           and lead oxide plates are dissolved).
        -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution
           becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).
Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate
in a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)
we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4
forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this
happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).

The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If
there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.

I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they
are for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore
the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with
these products for a newer battery.

This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.
In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
temperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this:
""If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to
 -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.""  We all know from experience (at
 least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is
not true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
the battery.

(Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge
 to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any
 such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This
 is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool
 during storage.)

Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!

Actually, I think J. Chiu knows the score and is just being
silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is
right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.

Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel,
hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).

The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine
way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
All the other units were defined many decades earlier.

The switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when

One of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are
1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than
nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many
fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many
fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were
adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").  
3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally
not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil
plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.

Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants
of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the 
heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in
order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is
normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is
desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because 
moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine 
low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity
causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest
pressure condensing environment is always the best.  

A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where
the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the
condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the 
condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too 
hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into
steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a
particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all
costs.  

The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant
in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower 
they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in
the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 
degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is
used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower
system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water
is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,
operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order 
to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher
hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the
condenser area.

At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the
air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge
water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water
from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and
humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water
temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical
""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.
It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful
in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the
plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets
too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive
pressure.

True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and
feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard 
stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.
The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood
the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few
dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved
oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will 
find outside the laboratory.

The object of a cooling tower is to distribute dissolved salts in 
cooling water over large areas of farmland and to therefore decrease
farm subsidies for non-producers by rendering their land infertile.

A side effect of this deficit-reduction program is that they provide
a low-T reservoir for a variety of industrial processes.

     Hello, 

   Let me introduce a problem:

   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? / 
   When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal 
to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/
   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...
The output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
   Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter 
actually measure? And what does it show?  

   Related question (less important to me):
   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
analog ones? 

   Thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at
avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. I would appreciate either 
way.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

Yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
distance to absolute zero. And in any case you're going to have to
borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this

Yes, you increase the RPM slip of a ""boxer"" type fan by installing
a capacitor in series with the fan's power supply.  The air flow of
small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4
uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working
voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is
usually required to experimentally determine the best size
capacitor for a given application.

For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.
It can run and start reliably from as low as about 4.5 VDC.  It is
exceptionally quiet, but at admittedly low flow.  I wish I knew who
made the fans for Radio Shack.

Since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  Hence,
digitally compressed TV is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
than amplitude modulated TV.

Subject: Re: Laser vs Bubblejet?
Organization: Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine

There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer.

I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your
nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.

HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an
original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no
soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP
service center for further information.

The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from
the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser
printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material
difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously
slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect
works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.

The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that
permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as
about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for
its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.

A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer
has completed its warm-up cyle.

Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.
Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the
problem.

Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste
could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing
stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet IV.

Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image
drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice
print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system.

The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are
subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.
The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is
almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.
I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.

It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If
you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,
the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.

You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in

When will people learn!

The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast 
resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to 
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
contact the ballast. 

Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary 
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in 
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.

If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a 
month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, 
DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).

Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance 
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and 
counting)

additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed
to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program.
Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever
time they like.

Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That
could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a
specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.


As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:
Limit the size of data that the program can work with,
Disable saving the data,
Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as
such)
Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started
and/or exited

etc....
but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.

Definately, I agree wholeheartedly.  If they can build the amp where

Sure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to
  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
I don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that
  the amp is doing nothing :)
The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

My opinions once again.

HAP controls just outside Chicago sells these.  I don't remember which

I just installed a Motorola XC68882RC50 FPU in an Amiga A2630 board (25 MHz
68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the FPU separately).  Previously
a MC68882RC25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  Now the
systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
the presence/type of FPU.  When I reinstall an MC68882RC25 the system works
fine, but with the XC68882 even at 25 MHz it does not work.  The designer
of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 Ohm)
might help, but that didn't change anything.  Does anybody have some
suggestions what I could do?  Does this look like a CPU-FPU communications
problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
Moreover, the place I bought it from is sending me an XC68882RC33.  I thought
that the 68882RC33 were labeled MC not XC (for not finalized mask design). 
Are there any MC68882RC33?

Marvin Minsky (hi there) writes of building ""perceptrons?"" in the 1950s using
motor-driven potentiometers to vary the weights. He reported that the circuits
worked even tho there were wiring errors. (Can you say ROBUST?)

Cadium Sulfide cells vary with light. CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID
somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used. 
Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8.
LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a
few mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and
eraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of
CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.

I've been wondering about this myself.  The house wiring thing is really

whom?  Given that these devices have been advertised to be effective against
everything from insects to rodents to nasty dogs, what is to say that my
insect repeller won't just annnoy my dog and give me headaches?  Could there
be that much selectivity in frequencies?  Have there been ANY studies
on the effects of various pressure levels, bands, and sweep patterns on
various life forms?

And how effective could they be?  I certainly would not want to tell anyone
that they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric
buzzer...

That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.
Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser
gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers
who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on
self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the
data on computer disk.

The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will
notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called
a ""bingo card"" in the industry) includes lines for a company name
and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national
advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as
best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company
and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably
send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer
call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they
will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail
outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th
e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have
nothing to mail out accept the catalog.

A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry
magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They
use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read
the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push
you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile
how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.
This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that ""23% of readers
requesting data were interested in capacitors."" And finally, some
magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For
example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information
about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.

The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines
include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the
advertiser can attempt to cull out the ""literature collectors"" from
the serious potential customers.

""Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.""

What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?

  Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more
  than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of
  weeks later.

  If you are really, really serious and you really, really want
  the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also
  cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually
  everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data
  on a computer printout.

  To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're
  not really ""qualified"" for, send in a bingo card at least every
  other month and circle two or three numbers.

  Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.
  Advertisers almost never call.

Yes,

Take Interstate I-70 to the route 48 exit.  Go south on 48 about
2-1/2 miles.  Trun right on Shiloh Springs Road.  The hamvention is
at the Harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north

It is possible to park at the mall to the west.  There are shuttle

If possible, get a Montgomery County, OH map from your local AAA

If you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly

Hi,

	Being a Electronic Engineering Student with only Electronic II under
my belt, I find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage Audio Amp. So, 
I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!

	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No,
Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:

	Ai [Current Gain]
	Av [Voltage Gain]
	Ap [Power Gain]
	or whatever.

I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but
I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts
list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin? 
SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag
so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in
the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could
figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas? 

	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp 
models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High
power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than
I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet
good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me? 

I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help!
Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News... 
And I'll post if there's and interest!

Radio-Electronics sends each company a bunch of computer-printed address

The company sends whatever it wants to -- normally a catalog.

I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a
chance to read the news for a couple of days...

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private
Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from
the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
in front of the user's eye.

The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA
compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up
and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the
sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image
projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
with the background.

I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I
looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking
if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found
annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly
used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.

about any commercial game in existence. The names of the companies (yes,
companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to
them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or 
something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition
is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own
convenience.

If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such 
company. I will not give the name of this ftp-site to anyone, even if only
to protect the companies which wrote the original games.

DISCLAIMER: I do not condone the use or cracking of any programs. I believe 
it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run.

On the subject of copy protection: Most pirates don't give a damn about 
using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting 
the program. They just don't have a conscience.

Assuming you are refering to standard POTS or ground start lines:

If you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor is the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC with respect to
ground while the TIP conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure
to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).  

If you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions, the RING
conductor will be the one with approximately -48 to -52 vDC while the TIP
conductor would look like it's floating (you may see some potential from
line capacitance it will bleed off over time).  Remember to use the telco
ground as your reference when making measurements.

Two things to watch for:
In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.
OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course
illegal.

If you can modify the design of the DTMF decoder, the ideal comunications
would be over a multi-drop system, like RS-485.  RS-485 boards are available
for PC's, probably cheaper than a bunch of RS-232 channels, and RS-485 is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply
8-pin DIP driver chip.  Software at the PC end would be similarly complex
for either RS-232 or RS-485, in my opinion.  The higher data rates possible
with RS-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.
Hope this helps.

Why are circuit boards green?  The material used to make them goes by two
names.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same
material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They
are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are
a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on
the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National
Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer
of epoxy resins) to find out.  As an aside, I occasionally mix clear epoxy
and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.
The proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in G-10.  They are
the same green color.

Here's something I posted about this a few years ago.  It's not fully
up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different
manufacturer's synonyms):

------
In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view
of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my
views on things like availability and backward compatibility):

74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively
	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball
	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.

74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher
	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.

74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.
	Very obsolete; use CMOS.

74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in
	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.

74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower
	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of
	devices.

74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high
	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.

74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things
	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.

74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly
	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.

74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with
	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer
	CMOS 74 families.

4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS
	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low
	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.
	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,
	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).
	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The
	clear choice when speed is not important.

74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power
	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for
	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.
	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of
	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power
	consumption at faster speeds.

74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read
	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility
	in CMOS involves some compromises.

10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources
	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for
	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow
	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,
	can be expensive.

100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and
	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.

As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and
74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices
you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just
have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible
with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of
hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.
10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.

Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are
interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.

Great Explaination, however you left off one detail, why do you always
see them at nuclear plants, but not always at fossil fuel plants.  At
nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas
fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot
water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many
fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive
contamination.

Just a shot here, but ya never know:

I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a 
while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the 
amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  
I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably 
lousy heat sinking.

You said ""a nice Alpine"" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higher
in quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside before
you scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.

Subject: Radar detector DETECTORS?
Organization: Virginia's Public Education Network (Richmond)
Lines: 50

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.

The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the
bonnet (US: ""hood"") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.

The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the 
battery off the ground may help.  I'm not sure if spraying with WD-40
would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

Just a thought...

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as ""1/3
octave"" or ""1/2 octave"" or some such terminology).

White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
db/octave).

Subject: Can Radio Freq. Be Used To Measure Distance?
Organization: Boeing Computer Services
Lines: 19

I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver?

Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft),
and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.

How about measuring vertical distance as well, any chance - or am I getting
ridiculous?

What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

Sorry if I'm ""mucking up"" the network with one of those questions best
answered by Bill Willis via US Mail... and I apologize for not being
""tuned-in"" to electronics. :-)

	I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think
you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM
+/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common
I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940.
I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of
difference.

	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote,
and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very
detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
specs. if the system uses that.

It appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast

that Motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.

If you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle,

for every other use you can buy a cheapie. I have a metex which is some 
made up name, as I have seen the same DMM with other brand names on it, I 
bought it about 4 yrs ago for Aus$125.00 (convert that to US and you see 
that it's definetly a cheapie.) So far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
moderate abuse, and has many features on it (CAP, FREQ,Transistor check, 
etc). I am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
the name. Hope this helps.

I will appreciate any advice or references to advice.  Also, exact part

Don't mount it on the side.  Call up Crown, the company that has the
patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.

Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.

Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap
Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a
clean balanced output.  Phil's mods seem to get reposted here on a regular
basis.

I don't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery.

However, you would have been better off leaving them outside. Keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside.
A warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one.

When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month.
Letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it (I suspect this is
what caused your problems).

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use
the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that
you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it
may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.

The things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the
film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when
the camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's
standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.

All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery
(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera.

I expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really
determined.

... Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold? My gut feeling is that, as a

compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.

Not hard, you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software, but
this hogs most of the available CPU cycles on a low-end controller.
I've seen some application note from Philips that used one of their
8051 derivatives as a printer buffer, with up to 1MB of dynamic ram
that was accessed and refreshed with software bit-banging.

Another alternative would be to use one of those nice DRAM controller
chips that ""create static RAM appearance"" and all that, but they may
be too expensive to make it worthwhile.

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 

Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing
high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing
line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.

Not entirely true. A friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game
GODS and asked me for help since he could not find a ""trainer"" (small
patch that lets you play without losing lifes). The game is compressed but
I did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file
would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the ""shield"" in the
game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.

There are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or
another and I have seen examples of this with my own eyes. The copy
protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,
compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly
compressed), dongles, key disks, etc...

I believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection
schemes.

     I'm looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response

I don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak,
per every beep I put on a cassette tape.

on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain
frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for 
the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of
color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...


     I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape.
So on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc. 
, with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED (
probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with
each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort
of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the
rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape
(except for background his), the LEDs would remain off. Please help!

We use a CD-ROM based system here.  There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a
4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for
something it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well.
THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.
It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff.

These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.

If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a
page-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump
the 5 or 6 pages you usually need.

I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available
to all Internet users.    :-)

I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain

to be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There's an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven't a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I
could really use copies of them or at least some help.
 
I need to know:
 
o How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.
o How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
  and if the small card is used.
o The purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more

	Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your
mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big
current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output
nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.

(nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about

	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest,
6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company
name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power,
mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a
1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals.
If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the
pertinent info.

	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida.
Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like 
nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices,
so they might be able to help you out.

	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.
The device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game, although you'd
need to up your carrier signal concept to 58.8 KHz......

Are you sure that he needs a two way converter? If he wants only
RS232->TTL I would suggest the MC1489, its very cheap (0.80 DM in
Germany). This chip needs only +5V. The MC1488 TTL->RS232-Converter
uses +12V and -12V.

BTW... The MAX232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the USA...
I paid 2.95 DM for a ITS80272 (made by Harris), its absolutely
compatible with the MAX232 or the ICL232.

The board itself is also identical, with room for all three caps. The

How does that make sense? 0.047/2 is 0.0235, essentially 0.022 for caps
(there are just standard caps, no special W/type/precision).

Paul,

Unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
just about every chip made.  The stuff they will stock are the ones
that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.

The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or
the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip
through them.

Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,
etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of
different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?
Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good
bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.
They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
they represent.

Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2
qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
a mail order outlet will charge.

My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use
too many esoteric parts sooner or later.

good luck,

aaron

They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin
of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
faceplate, if any).

The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.

So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every
grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens
to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground,
the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
ground will remain relatively noise-free.

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert
unbalanced 1/4"" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher
quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from 
Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4"". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy
transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30.
You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear.
The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component
with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.

It isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here, but rather
which is better at transferring the heat out of the (presumably warmer
than ground temperature) battery.  Call it a question of thermal
conductivity, or of insulating ability, or ""thermal mass"" - whatever you
like.  Question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the

Organization: Data General Corporation, Westboro, MA
Lines: 26


I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my
cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.
On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor
to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my
cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
of 47k.

It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses
that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the
rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should
be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.
This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not
doing anything high-speed.

In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
speed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the
resistor value?

After talking about 63/37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point...
""Occasionally, impurities may be added to solder, to vary charactersitics 
within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance.  For
example, addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce
the amount solder moves under stress when solid.  For particular
applications additions of impurities may be warranted but, in general, it
is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible.""

If you are just getting sick of the real estate used by the HCT373, you could
always use the approach I have seen one designer take - he stuck the chip in
the middle of the EPROM socket, under the EPROM.  Naturally, you have to use
an IC socket with the right dimensions, but layout is really easy.

Well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
information.  But the city's cable channel (35 in CableVision areas)
shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, I
believe).  Most of the major LA freeways are covered.  The
computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
(respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and ""incident""--I might be off
a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).

I often look at this display in the morning to see if I really want to
fight the traffic on the Sepulveda Pass or work from home for a little
while to wait for it to clear.

Another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  CalTrans
has had a ""big board"" driven from this data in their traffic control center
for some time.  I don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
it.

Organization: University of California, Berkeley

NNTP-Posting-Host: uclink.berkeley.edu
Summary: Need help!!!

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...

For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs:

Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V
Current:   *limited* at 1A

Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A
AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)

Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting
regulator chip ;^)

Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do,
if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the
supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we
should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm 
resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by
necessity, must be 1V.

The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output 
power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.

So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?

Thanks in advance.

Take a lemon.  Stick a copper strip into the lemon.  Stick a galvanized
nail in about 1 to 1-1/2 inches from the copper strip.  You should get
about 1/2 volt from it - enough to light an LED.

If you use MEK for your sake wear safty glasses or better still

Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I have
a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
(excellent) gear).

One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO is
whether you can turn interpolation off. The other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode.

I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are
_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a ""real"" scope :-)

This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluated
the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has
a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
least they appear to be logically laid out.

One more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. These instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement
over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our
scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
longevity of the instruments.

Reply-To: paj@uk.co.gec-mrc (Paul Johnson)

I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I
came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling
components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a
current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side
to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I
think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.

Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for
picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a
couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an
efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour).

Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the
temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably
its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no
leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more
(although that would be a lousy way to control it).

What I would like to know is:

1: Are the above guesses correct?

2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?
   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm
   too fast when I unplug it)

3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like
   magic!

4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?


Thanks in advance,

I've had my Fluke 8060A here at work for just over 10 years now.
It is a wonderful meter.  Several colleagues here have some of the
newer Fluke meters, though I still would just as soon hang on to my
8060.  The 8060 a is the 1980s digial ""analog"" to the Simpson 260
analog DMM of the 1950-1960s.  There was/is (?) an 8060B that had
extended frequency response.

I've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by Soar that I keep
in my toolbox at home.  I've had that for six or seven years now
and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than
adequate for day-to-day hobby use.  I think Soar OEMs their stuff
for a number of vendors.  Some of JDR Microdevices' stuff looks
rather similar to Soar's.

We're looking at a series of chips by WSI, the PSD3xx series. They have
_mega_ address decoding logic on them, various ROM sizes (upto 1Mbit),
various RAM sizes (upto 16 K), and 19 I/O ports which can be chip select

Cute chip, 44 pin PLCC package.

I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.
When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4
wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So I
have one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.

Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter across
the red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on my
second line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first
line. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the second
line(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the
red and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. 

Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.

Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in
from the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and
went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines read
open.

I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?

Up to 60 microamperes  =   on hook

Over something like 10 mA  = off hook

        Yes, it is possible.  I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, 
with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.
   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is 
bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip 
numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, 
which will do you NO good for reading in.
  
          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:
  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.
  In pascal, you would ""Write(Port[xxx]);"" where xxx is the address in 
either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the 
strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, 
so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output 
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, 
do ""Port[xxx]:=value
"".
 
                Hope this helps.
        Let me know if you need more help.

Bzzzzzt! Wrong answer.  The UK tone dialling is identical to the US system. 
The different settings on your modem are so that it uses CCITT V21 & V22 
tones for data transmission, rather than Bell 103 & Bell 121 tones, which are 
used only in the USA and canada AFAIK.  As most people now use at least 
V22bis, this is largely irrelevant.

For your information:

I hooked up my ImageWriter I to my COM1 serial port and used the C-Itoh
8510 driver in Windows 3.1.  The cable I am using is a straight-thru
cable connected to a Null Modem Adapter I got at Radio Shack (catalog
#26-1496a) for $4.95.  It seems to work fine with both DOS and Windows.
I used the following command in DOS

	C:\DOS\mode COM1:9600,n,8,1,p

and set up the port the same way in the Windows Ports setup.

the Null Modem connections are as follows:

	1	to	1
	2	to	3
	3	to	2
	4	to	5
	5	to	4
	6+8	to	20
	20	to	6+8
	7	to	7

I printed from several applications and all seems OK.

	With relays alone, you will always get a transient when
you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear
the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator
is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch,
THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.

	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few
thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which
drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices
are cheaper than relays.

      Well, I've now been working on this DAMNED stepper controller board
 since 9pm.  It's now 6am... I'm pissed off.  Period.  Alright, I can
 drive the steppers through the 3479P's; no problem (that's with the
 6-wire steppers, 2 to +, and the other 4 are the phase lines).  Problem
 1:  I've got some 4 wire steppers.  I put the darkest line to + and the
 other 3 to the 3479P... worked, kinda.  Tried it with a printer stepper
 (moves the head back and forth, 4 wires), didn't work too well.  It 
would
 shift back and forth (use something like a 4017 instead?)  Also I've 
been
 trying to get a bunch of NPN's to work with it... NO LUCK... tried 
PNP's,
 still NO LUCK!!!  I don't know if I'm cursed on this or what, but I feel
 my brain slowly frying with the thought of STEPPER ... ARGGG!!!
         I don't know what's wrong with the transistor hook-up (to-220 
pkg
 type), also tryed the 2n2222-pkg type... no luck.

                         I'm going to try getting some z's, and I hope 
you
 can help me with this problem.
   If someone can please help me with this soon, it would be greatly

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair,
Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least
that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface
Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes
for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc). The guide is mainly for hooking
the player to a computer, but with a little work, you could build a wired
controller.

   Two things to watch for:
   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing.
   In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
   are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and
   in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
   Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
   phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.
   OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course
   illegal.

As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecom
operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.

I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMF
dialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have
been retrofitted with ""magic fingers"" that converts from DTMF to pulse
dialing.

The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line
(400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200
game machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking
with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the
2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).
Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into
a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to
backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could
be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them
into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.

Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got
two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa
cartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and
handling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo
(interested in that too?).

Hope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too,
since they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).

I've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
transformer cores and windings (the 60Hz kind). Likewise, if
anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
I suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
real difficult at 15 KHz).

Hi, folks out there !

I don't know whether I am in the right newsgroup, but I have a question.

If I am completely wrong here in this group, could you mail me the right name  
of the correct newsgroup ?

A friend of mine is studying electronics at the Technical University in  
Karlsruhe/Germany since one year.

He wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control  
engineering in the U.S.A. .

Does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the U.S.A. ?
Could you send me information like (e-mail)adresses of the universities,  
""quality"" of these studies, and so on ?

Is it possible to e-mail the universities directly to get information ?

Do the universities send information via e-mail ?

Please could you answer via e-mail, because I don't read this newsgroup  
regularly.


Thanks in advance.

I'm still not sure how this is supposed to work, since the .ZIP files

The 9144w4 is the date code but none of my books list a W03563.
What is it out of and can you tell us what kind of circuit it is in?

In the odd case that 9144w4 is not the date code, NTE says a 9144-60
is an AM reciever subsystem and a 9144-61 is an FM subsystem, but these
are both in 16 pin packages.

What frequency is your carrier?

Have you considered using two tones, one for 1 and another for 0?

How high is your RS-232 data rate?

Can you use more than one carrier freq?

Have you considered hiring an RF data transmission consultant?

You might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. They

RF is used for much longer distances in two major modes. Transponder and
phase measurment. Transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
receiver time.

Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and
measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the
Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
stations.

RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS
manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used,
esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette.

On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as

I know x86 and 680x0 assembly quite well, thank you.  I know exactly which
two bytes need to be changed, I have the code to do them too.  I just said
""Don't ask me which ones.""  I didn't say I don't know what that means.

Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which
does a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match
value stored (encrypted, of course) in the program.  It could be claimed
as a part of anti-virus code, and it would not be far from the truth.

Did ANYONE read what I wrote?  That is NOT what I wrote! (or meant!)  

What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the
restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the
manufacturer.  The manufacturer will then supply the
then-proven-legitimate-user with a patch that will disable the restriction
and PROUDLY PROCLAIM the legal copy with the ""Registered to XXX"" screen.

> > Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more

Of course they will, but that was NOT my point.  The purpose of copy
protection is to discourage casual pirates (""Oh, can I have a copy of
that?""/""Sure, here."") and the less sophisticated pirates (""Let's look for
all those calls to INT13H..."") .  Any one determined enough to break copy
protection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire
load-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make
such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses
(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy
protection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy
protection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.  How many
of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us?  Not that many.

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their
54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple,
repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope
in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling
rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but
before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.

Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz
sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front
end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for
equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.

So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where I need storage for
later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to
fall...

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not  
sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the  
metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in  
the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook  
something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)

>Yes. It's called RADAR.
Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its
reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of
the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example,
the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500
feet altitude.

Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually
travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something
like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad,
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.

Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again
the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E.
should know about anyway ;-).

>> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength

This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit
over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With
the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at
one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for
the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...

>Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in

Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.
This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.
Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...

>> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies
around 4 GHz.

Hope this helps...

of low quality. Also, it is improbable that any credit will be given to a

   Two things to watch for:
   In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some
   of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
   phone can be set to pulse dialing.

Most (if not virtually all) swedish exchanges can handle tone
dialling. Many older electromechanical exchanges have been modified
accept tone dialling.

True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or
so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch
of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least
defeats your approach.  It's a little costly, though.

Personally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program.

Sorry Charlie...

I have a dozen, VERY blue LED's on my bench right now. They have
a clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely BLUE. The hue
is sort of a ""summer day cloudless sky blue"" but make no mistake,
they are blue.

You can buy them from Digikey, Circuit Specialist, Jameco (I think),
LED-Tronics, Stanley Optoelectronics, and others. The current price
is around $2.50 each for small quantities. I will also be selling
them through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks).
Write for details if interested.

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on
what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good 
electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need
shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic
fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded,
like a Faraday cage.

The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances,
you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems.
You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a
real problem (one that bit me once).

Thus, a deciBell (deci-, l., tenth of + Bell) is a fractional part of the 
original Bell.  For example, SouthWestern Bell is a deciBell.

And the measure of current, Amp, is actually named after both the AMP company
and the Amphenol company.  Both companies revolutionized electronics by
simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets 
were affected by the amount of current running through the wires.

The Ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers, thus
our use of the Ohms...


Alexander Graham Bell, actually, is where Bell came from...

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
box. If you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. Are you sure that what you
are doing is on the level. Sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
at somebody's unlisted number.  Fess up.

This was the Pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.
It didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but
it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.
There are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.

There was a pneumatic amplifier designed by Alexander Graham Bell, as well,

For the most part, silver-solder is not used for general soldering
tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth. Silver-solder, when
exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually
grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically
short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. For this 
reason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.
Fortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites
as fast as silver-solder. Therefore, it is used extensively.

That's completely inaccurate.  The ohm was an original standard made equal
to a the resistance of a standardized electric stove heating element.  That's
where the song ""Ohm on the Range"" came from, of course.

I have a Fujitsu M2322K which has been removed (I believe) from a digital
X-Ray machine (takes X-Ray pictures without film).  The Fujitsu part number
is B03B-4745-B002A.

I have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type
of 168 megabyte capacity (though I was told it was over 800 megabytes).
However, there is very little information on the interface standard used.
It appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection
corresponds to I know not. One connection is a 30-way IDC, the other a
60-way IDC.

If anyone has any information on this device, I would be most grateful
if you could provide it.

Thanks.

Subject: Home-made IR remote extender

Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:

  I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is a 
little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. Then
I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works
like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are
relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with
my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
VCR, it didn't work.
  The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD
player...

	Any advice would be appreciated....

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are
connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  

Hmmm.  How are those orange ""isolated ground"" outlets (often used in
computer rooms) wired?

Yes.

I use 74HC4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
works fine. In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into 
50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
resistive.

Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Remember that the output load is seen by the input device.

Like most high-volume manufacturers, Adcom has most of its PC boards
assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  Final
assembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.

The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;
by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcom
also tends to prefer American and European components over their
Japanese/Far East equivalents.

Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make products
that perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and Van
Alstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.

Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you might
prefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is

See if Radio Shack has a National Semiconductor Adjustable Voltage 
Regulator, (National) part number: LM350T or LM350K.  These devices are 
rated for an input to output differential of up to 35 Volts @ 3 Amps.

Digi-Key Corp. has these parts, as well as several other useful regulators.
If you don't have their catalog, their phone number is: 1-800-344-4539.

I can only guess that you may intend to recharge a 7.5 VDC nicad battery 
with this device, and if I'm right, you may want to look through some of the 
hobbiest books to get various ideas for battery charging circuits, first.

Refer to patents by JAMES HARRIS ROGERS:
958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188

He details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.

Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was
unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this
soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.

The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of
their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is
quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore,
the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods
were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely ""abberant"".

Subject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing
Organization: University of Kansas Academic Computing Services
Lines: 33

Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a
couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.
spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C
and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time
delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this
application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.
When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x
the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it
is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K
resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of
2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)
Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for
256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.
After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14
day timing cycle and so forth.

Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts
to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see
what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that
has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns
off ;-)

Well, you might try the A.R.R.L.'s license study guides. For example, my

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent I should 
use to clean duct-tape adhesive from carpet?
Someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out.

Is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax?
(whatever that is ... but it just barely ties this query into 
sci.electronics)

Thanks for your help

Does this imply the German tone dialing is compatible with the American 
one?  I know at least the British system is not -- it is supposedly close 
enough though that an American phone will work.  But my modem (American)
has a special setting for British standards...

Even easier, my area supports 311.  Dial this and a recording recites your number.

This topic was beaten to death a year or so ago.

The concrete is not the problem. 

Lead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long
time), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem.

I would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware.  What did

the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors

Ah-ha!  I'm not alone at last!  Which Sony do you have??  I have a
27""SXR (pre-XBR series, circa 1987).  That damn thing used to
make noise like a mad-man.  I had/have 2 separate problems...one being the
flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
came together. 

First:  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly,
the thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential
in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it.

Second:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I
leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on,
and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the
cover on!! :-(

A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole
leak somewhere on the flyback.  Usually it's surrounded by a bunch of
black dust/dirt.

I hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!

	Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators

	(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)

	Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty
	good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems
	when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious
	amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my

	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.
	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose
	me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full
	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd
	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
	low volume :-)

	My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are

	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? 

	Take care.

	P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and
	(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A
	and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be
	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.

What do you mean by ""police band"" - there is no such thing.

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
openers in malls would be illegal.

One of the great problems here is that there are too many
ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly
local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
but incompetent idiots.

Unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
Lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
the day where you are faced with death for not doing X, and
amputation of all your limbs for doing X ... the choice will be yours.

Well, yes and no.  The _image_ can't be on the screen less than 1/30
of a second, but a _mixture_ of images that's about 90% of the field
that was supposed to be there and 10% of the 'subliminal' addition
could be overlaid for one field, producing the same overall effect to
our sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1/300 second.

..although, like the previous poster, I have to reserve my doubts

Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites.  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters.  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on
a good day) are available from many sources.

I designed and built hardware in 1988 that would output a logic level (from
a 567 tone detector) upon detecting a 500 microwatt LED 28 feet away.
Used a Motorola MRD360, biased linearly  in a DC-feedback loop to servo out
variations in sunlight (and 60Hz from lights). Used no lenses.

Well it looks as if Digi-Key sells a chip with the number ICL232 that does what
you want.  They are selling it for about $3.50...

Hope this helps...

Not necessarily true; a short in one, if near the maximum series

If your looking for LEDs in the $.10-$.20 range, forget it. Blue LEDs just
recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive.
Maybe in the future they will become less expensive (and brighter), but
for now it's going to cost you and the output will be limited. If they ever
do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green LEDs, you're probably
going to see a whole new family of color displays.

Yes, but still not a 6502 for those differences.  Same instruction set,
of course.

Yes, the same number, but an entirely different device.  I should have
qualified this further by stating that this was the PAL version of the TIA -
I am not 100% sure that the NTSC TIA would have a different number.

Does anyone on the net actually have details of the TIA, as this is the only
device I have not yet discovered details about?  Atari Australia, when asked,
claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600
had failed, as the US head office had refused to provide it.

I saw a couple of cheaper devices with PN2222's and a couple of resistors
hooked up as a cheap inverter.  Nasty, but workable, and cheaper than a
7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

You're right, it is HAPP Controls, Inc., but you can buy direct from them.  I
don't have a phone number with me, but anyone interested in it can email me for
it.  I don't remember their button price, but the joystick price was $8.95
per dozen at last check.  Should be slightly higher for one or two, but cheaper
than Parts Express.  As for the trackballs, i don't know the new price either.
But I can sell you rebuilt arcade trackballs for $50.  That includes new rollers
and new bearings (when nec.).  I also have a pile of used joysticks and buttons
that i would be willing to sell.  Please email to address below if interested.

I would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
IR emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
daylight.  The IR source could be emitting a signature; I'm leaning toward
30 KHz square wave with 50% duty cycle.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give
information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s),
possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp
current pulses.  At this current the duty cycle of the LED drops to 10% and I
would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.

Has anyone done something like this?

I'm working on an audio mixer project, but I'm having trouble finding
parts.  I want to use op-amps for the gain control stages.  The ones
I have found that are good for audio are LM739 and LM833, but I cannot
find either of these in the electronic parts places I've looked.

Are there any good substitute op-amps and/or are there any parts
suppliers in the LA area that carry this kind of thing (10KOhm dual
audio taper slider pots would be nice, too).

Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I've been thinking of sending into Mad magazine an idea for a 
parody, of those books entitled ""How Things Work"" that
engineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators,
flourescent lights, etc. work.

The parody would be ""How Things Really Work.""  Under ""Canned
Food"", on the left page you'd see the description from 
""How Things Work"": gleaming stainless steel equipment
pasteurizing the food to precisely the right temperature,
then sealing the can in an oxygen-free environment, etc.

On the right page you'd see ""How Things Really Work"":
brain-dead workers sending disgusting food to the
gleaming equipment -- rotting vegetables, parts of
animals people don't eat, barrels of sugar and chemicals.

Under ""Elevators"" you'd see (on the left) computer geniuses
working out algorithms so that X number of people
waiting for Y elevators will get to Z floors in the shortest
time.  On the right, you'd see giggling elevator controllers
behind a one-way mirror in the lobby choosing which people
appear to be in the biggest hurry and making them wait longest.

This is not news.  In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it was
such a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a ""space 
saber"" or ""light sword"" or something likewise theme-y.  My addition was 
using a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition to 
character graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.  
No one to kick but myself...

Ten years ago is about right, since I built mine in '84 or '85.

comments from Phototransistor experts?)

We intended to use this atop a stepper motor, to provide headings to the
beacons. The plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons, of different frequencies, in 
each room, and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to. We did not do so.
One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps!
Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor 
technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going to
explain resection over the net.)

Given hindsight, I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling
phototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at
the several expected frequencies, to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon.
By doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledge
of the angular response of the phototransistor, you SHOULD be able to
rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.

I have a thermal fuse from a Apple Laserwriter II power supply (Made

tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a 
rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  It
is about 0.2""x0.2""x0.1"", with both leads coming out of one of the
0.1""x0.1"" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asian
company, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuse
is rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  I
only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want
to talk to me, let alone, deal with me.

Please advise via E-mail.

In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical
electronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you
don't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found.  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.
They didn't emit very much light...

5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish 
to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great 
that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor 
only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
 
                What could the problems be and what else could I use

As a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
the circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary
opening and closing of the path.

The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high
impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic
impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers
the audio.

In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
impedance.

Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.

Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before
break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.

Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.

A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists
of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is
off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying
the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and
you have a mixer!

Lots of luck!

I once wrote such a program (in BBC basic...) It was very crude, and took
around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of 
intelligence), and told you the best combination >Rq and the best below Rq.

If you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and
then search the solution space using three nested loops. I'm sure you
could knock this up in an hour.

Look for information about 567 tone decoder chip. It is an easy to use
chip for detecting sound of certain frequency. You need only one
567 and some other componets for each led you want to control.
The chip can take the voltage levels, which the casette gives.
Radio Shack Archer Semiconductor Reference Guide gives good information
how to use that chip. It should be simplest way to go. The chip costs
something like 1-2 $.

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs
for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down
to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and
it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.  This
sort of thing can easily multiply power consumption by a considerable
factor, because the CMOS transistors that are supposed to be OFF aren't
all the way hard OFF.

$50 each!!  Don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a
little.  I've found DOD brand DI boxes for as cheap as $20 each.  You can 
get higher end ones for more, but for PA use for bands, I wouldn't bother.
Making one yourself might work, but getting a sturdy enough enclosure might
be hard (they're made of heavy guage metal, since they're always on the floor,
being kicked around a lot). For any additional questions on this topic, you 
might want to post to rec.audio.pro

  I was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these
electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage?  What kind of
memory is stable/reliable enough, non-volatile enough and independent enough
(of outside battery power) to last say, 10 years or more, in the life of a
vehicle?  I'm amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for
this length of time (especially in light of all the gizmos I work with that
are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow).

Side question:  how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with
a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles, after say 100/200/300K
actual miles.  Looks like fraud would be fairly easy - for the price of a
new odometer, you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the
buyer it has.

Thanks for any insight.

1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10  module by putting it 
before the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not very 
reliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?

2. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it is
broken, too much current? How can I get arround that? 
  
3. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X10 PC computer
interface without having it go 100% on first and then down. I am doing
my own programing, not the X10 program.

I've come across a circuit from Integrated Circuit Systems Inc

NTSC signal.  
The output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various 
speeds.  I notice that it outputs a 28mhz clock..  can this output be 
used on an Amiga system?
And must it be NTSC/VGA  or can it be NTSC/NTSC  ?
 
Any simple circuits to boost an NTSC to a VGA signal?

Subject: How to kill AC inductive load spiking?
Organization: University of Nebraska--Lincoln

NNTP-Posting-Host: unlinfo.unl.edu

Is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of
the AC cycle?  A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?

I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with
zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays ""quiet"", AC-wise.
But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control
of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets
one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but
I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having
to do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might not
be sufficient.  Ideas?

Well - 100+ amps anyway. Transmissions are generally for a short interval.
The battery would supply the rest. Of course, if you transmitted too much,
you would run the battery down.

It really would not be that much of a brake.  Even at 50% efficiency, 1500
watts would only consume 4 horsepower.

	Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total
hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data
from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard

drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!

	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope),
but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS
information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS
manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the
motherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk
backup/restore.

	As long as it wasn't done too terribly often.  Otherwise I think it

	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be
reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is ""this
software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to
install it on other machines.""  Or something similar; Access for Windows
does this and it only requires a click on ""OK"" to go away.  Pretty
non-intrusive, but it gets the point across.

	This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware
products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big
software companies to implement this without it getting very
cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.

Gee, I got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
use in WWII, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
landing on a beach, for example.

Which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  At a communications
conference a Marine Corps communications officer said he didn't care
much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication
systems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted
was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 Japanese
transistor radio stuck in the ear of every Marine hitting the beach.

I am searching for programms concerning audio effects.
I built a 4 channel mixer (4ADC + 1DSP) for audio signals.
I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want to
include some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus.
The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cant

So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work,

We'll let you live, but just this once....

There's more to a real ""storage"" scope than just a long-persistence
phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all;
what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,
which becomes charged as the electron beam intially ""writes"" the trace.
With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level ""flood""
electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
which are next to the ""written"" areas on the storage screen.  There are
some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
tube, and the stored trace tends to ""bloom"" with time. 

Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
frame-buffer memory anyways.

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound 
like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are 
common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the
local oscillator). 

Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must 
generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc
frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.  
The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since
the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...
I think you get the picture.

When the utility gave up on that Cinnci, OH plant (Zimmer?) and

Sorry about following up my own article, but I wanted to continue
that what might be being missed here is that the important thing
might not be temperature differences per se, but the action of
heat sinking the battery.

Perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical
lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting
one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This
would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries
at the same ambient temperature.

I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the
one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
some validity.

Back in high school I used to work for a detailing company, and one of the
services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil BEFORE you
sell the car...  ;-}). Unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure
washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. On more than one
occasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have
gotten under the distributor (I would put a plastic bag around it to try and
minimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly
IMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. The usual
solution was to carry a can of WD-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray
all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.

It may be a myth, but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash...

my condolences.

i can't even imagine what i could do with self-modifing hardware.
i *can* imagine self-modifying software,
and even though *all* my teachers say that's BAD, even Worse than GOTO,
check out what the experts *used* to say about self-modifying code:
(he uses ""orders"" rather than ""opcodes"")


""On the Principles of Large Scale Computing Machines""
by Goldstine and von Neumann,
collected in 
_John von Neumann: Collected Works, Vol. V_
reprinted here with absolutely no permission from anyone.
""We plan... to have a full size (40 binary digit) word hold
either contain
1 full size number (... equivalent to 12 decimal digits,
but we will use the first binary digit to denote the sign)
or two (20 binary digit) orders.
....
	It should be added that this technique of
automatic substitutions into orders,
i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders
(under the control of other ones among its orders)
is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if
part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then
""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the 
variable which is obtained in the course of the computation
requires that the machine itself should modify, or
rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which
controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this
modification after it has already calculated the value of the 
variable in question.
	On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its
own orders is one of the things which makes coding
the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.""

Hi,

Right now I should do some characterization of opamps. Because I don't  
have
special equipment for this task, I have to do this job with relativly  
simple
equipments (Frequency sweeper, DSO, etc.). 
Does anyone know good test circuitry for characterization of opamps? 
Especially for measuring open-loop gain, phase margin, PSSR, CMMR and so  
on.
Are there any books or application notes on this subject available?

Please reply vi e-mail or nn.

Thanks

      This is a 1950s idea.  Supposedly, splicing in a frame of ""Buy
popcorn"" upped popcorn sales in a movie theatre.  Big flap at the time.
Congress involved.  Talk of making it illegal.  General agreement by
networks not to do it.

      A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency
re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape
with single-frame messages.  It aired on a few stations, but a tech
at one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at
the tape frame-by-frame to find the ""defect"".  Big flap.  FCC notified.
Commercial pulled.  Press reports. Embarassed ad agency.  You could
probably find the press reports via Dialog or Nexis if you wanted.

      Now that everybody has VCRs, it's not likely that anybody could
get away with this on TV.

Hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked

Sure, you've already got the right idea.

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little
depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
the availability of parts.

Hows that sound?

					---Joel Kolstad

P.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
accurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with
100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.

     I have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  I simply
ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8V in this case.   As long as your
analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.
Of course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and
+8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic
must be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
control logic.  In my case, I was able to use the bipolar supply all the
way.

Does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data I/O (print spooler,
digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a DMA chip or a
dedicated microcontroller?  Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best
way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
by the smart data I/O.
 
Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easy
to obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit
those characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want,
but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with
onchip (E)EPROM.
 
So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple
to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
few I/O lines.

A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information that
you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of 
human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and the
WATSMART System ??).  These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and
Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a
spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence,
the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the
four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of
the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional
to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII
graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)

If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position
of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina-
tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When
this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of
""tuning"" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED
for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between
the two is the position of the LED.

Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and
they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made
systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ... 

Lindholm, L.E., and K.E. Oberg, ""An Optoelectronic Instrument for Remote
On-Line Movement Monitoring"", Biotelemetry, 1, 94-95, 1974.

Woltring, H.J., and E.B. Marsolais, ""Opto-Electronic (SELSPOT) Gait Measure-
ments in Two and Three Dimensional Space - A Preliminary Report"", Bull. Pros-
thetics Research, 46-52, 1980.

Most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate
measurement than you need, but I think that its simplicity beats scanning
a quadrant detector with a pan/tilt system until you reach zero difference.

Water. Nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. The heat is then used to
heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
resultant steam drives the turbines.

The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
to continue the cycle

An Easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the
balanced low-Z output, but this solution does not provide any
galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and
mixer. If no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,
crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,
the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (It is
cheap...somewhat $10/DI-box).
Not sure, but Craig Anderton did introduce one DI-box project
in Guitar Player mag years ago (transformerless).....

       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual 
boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry
that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's
more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system
as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  

       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they
usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the
way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,
rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal 
pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".  

       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is 
purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when
the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than 
cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.

You didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  Where
exactly are you running 100MHz??  THe digital side?  TTL?
ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment 
all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along
with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name
a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long
as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  

A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design
Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered
to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.

The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself
has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I
don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
probably isn't going to make that much difference

If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun...
TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment.

Look at the 4053.  This is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog
multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run
from a single-ended supply as well).  With dual supplies, the logic
inputs still range from ground (0 Volts) to VDD.

This is a neat (well, I think so) design for a switchable-polarity
amplifier:

                 +-----/\/\/\-------+
                 |                  |
                 |    /--------\    |
INPUT -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |
       |              |  opamp |----+------- OUTPUT
       +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |
                 |    \--------/
                 |
CONTROL	---------X (analog switch)
                 |
                 |
                ---
                GND

All resistors are equal-value.  When the analog switch is closed,
the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  With the switch open, it is
non-inverting-gain-of-one.  You can clean up the circuit to trim
out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
up as carrier feed-through).

For high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).

I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance

Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement
like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics 
to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut
and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the

  Well, Bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in Austria, there are

a closed, often sealed, box) :-)
  As far as I remember from Germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody

seen just wires sticking out of the wall... And I thought Slovakia was the

Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 cap
will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their
performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.
The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,
so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering
the cold).

You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,
that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every
1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would
need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz
oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.

I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the
solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.

Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't
guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable
conditions.

I am not sure about this, but I believe that Analog Devices in Norwood,
MA makes a relatively inexpensive acceleration sensor (primarily for
use in auto air-bag systems). I do not know specs or anything else, but
you might give them a call to find out more info.

For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable
leakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that
is ""causing interference to other services"".

Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and
measurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem,
and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the
normal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and
microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong
Cable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter
to the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cable
company will probably start treating you much better when they realize
you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.

What is important is to document your case as it relates to the
applicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* to
at least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file
with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement
report that details the results of leakage testing.

But remember, call the cable company first, and give them a
chance to work to correct the problem before contacting
the commission.

I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via
the airborne method.

Check the station's master sync generator.  You'll probably find that
it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't
being used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.

Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD
outputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to the
cameras.

If neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync
separator.  Look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators -
they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.

I am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular American phone
on your home system. I vaguely remember a few years ago, when ""Deutsche
Bundespost"" split into Postdienst, Postbank, and Telekom there was some
discussion about a new regulation. I know that cordless or cellular phones
still have to be approved by the Telekom, but does that hold true for regular
phones? In my areacode in Germany (2234 - Frechen, near Koeln) you can use
touch-tone dialing. I assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively
set to pulse dialing. Last time I checked (Jan '93) the Cologne areacode 221
was still solely pulse dialing.

BTW, touch tone does become more common in Germany, bringin with it the
flourishing of 1-900 services (in Germany 0190). I just hope we'll all have
ISDN some time at an affordable price - idle wishes...

The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional
or not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or
input presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively
coupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.

If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own.

If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input
through to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change. This may mask the switch click.

An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR)
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles
use this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy.
Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.

For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try 
looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its
older predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed
prior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete
and IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly).
All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multi-page article.

Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as
putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.

Hope this helps at least get you started.

Are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
out level signals?  Also, are the clicks you mentioning the big
clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
bounce?  How are you driving the relays?  TTL gate output?  Switching
transistor?  How are the relays connected to what you are driving?

Need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)

Hmmm...
  A possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold.  The clerk sticks it
in the store PC and asks for the buyers ID. Later, if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. In addition copies which were
sent to distributors/stores would have a vendor reg # or serial # in order to
track in store piracy.

Possible additional program security schemes would be:
1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in
   and registration. (inconvenient)
2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)
3. encryption, crc check, self modifying code (limited effectiveness)
4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation/setup config or
   memory manager, etc. which would check the main program's crc. 
   (only as effective as above methods at best.)
5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked 
   copies of the program and/or the offenders hard drive. (risky, and probably
   illegal, certainly immoral)

my new ideas aren't terribly feasible to implement as presented, but I thought
if I threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.
What is the problem with parallel port security keys? I haven't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes, so I don't know what the

Ok, I was under the impression that it accepted digital input.

I still don't know for sure if it accepts BOTH interlaced and 
non-interlaced as I have gotten conflicting info.

Subject: Polaroid Range finder interference-Help!
Organization: /etc/organization
Lines: 26

We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. We
would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between
firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same
direction. 

To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C
5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that
corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line
of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;
we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the
time the init line of sonar B is activated. 

We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.
We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
for sonars B and C. 

Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
this type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
appreciated.

I believe that the ""A-D converters"" found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your
paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works
pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as non-linear as that.

Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher
voltages would be more precise).

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...

The father of a friend of mine is a police officer in West Virginia.  Not  
only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
cases . . ..  No foolin!  He can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (Yes,  
I realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
His ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
living, I have heard . . ..

So what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???

Subject: Grounding power wiring, was Re: a question about 120VAC outlet wiring
Lines: 163
Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1
Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY

There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding
practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:

The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or
the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to
carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the
voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It
should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the
normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in
the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding
conductor.  

Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages
on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding
conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for
this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in
many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read
both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on
installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated
grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors
back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service
entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many
of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide
a safe ground or a quiet ground or either. 

The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is
referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be
white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in
most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance
panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household
service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which
attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  

The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In
the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the
circuit from the panel to the load device.  

Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding
conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance
from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but
measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,
under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the
grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of
the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since
there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also
no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment
has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""
ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. 
The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few
tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not
present a shock hazard.  

HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact
with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,
a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to
flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you
will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)
Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in
some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of
inadequate size, causing it to overheat.

With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a
short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may
flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which
increases the possibility for shock or fire.  

Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on
the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often
causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in
technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.

The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as
well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for
lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back
to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded
objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses
quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the
dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it
flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause
corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,
and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop
between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the
water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. 
(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not
it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)

Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any
sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service
entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have
a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this
application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the
grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding
screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above
ground, with the possible problems listed above.

The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one
building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be
used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate
wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. 
These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days
before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to
have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to
have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place
of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate
neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings
(since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the
wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. 
So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,
it's primarily for lightning protection.

People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding
conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere
there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good
grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes
is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under
the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this
aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does
its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall
tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding
locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  

""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty
sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have
the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and
inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the
greenfield.

""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes
often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often
from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold
box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and
the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with
120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator
here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one
of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a
ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in
the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the
box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.

On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets
when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them
without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the
protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't
install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is
desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is
connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,
whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something
provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded
GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93
code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be
renumbered though.) 

We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more
to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

This definately gets the car going, but... WD-40 is highly flammable. Explosive
even in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
eg. And contact points tend to arc a tiny bit :)

I once saw the alternator/points cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
it had been restored to life with WD-40... fun to watch
(It was a Honda MR-50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
grommet, so it wasn't really a big blast.)

PS As a more serious aside, it is apparently also conductive, so it is best 
to exercise caution with it around mains wiring.

Yes it has to be very clear (like it wasn't there).  And of course, cost is 
always a factor.  I am trying to get an idea of the feasability of such an 
idea.  But I don't want to give too much away.

Do you know what a bi-metallic strip is?
Just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which 
when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your 
christmas tree lights).

So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon, 
heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the 
starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out 
(O/C).

BTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one 
day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) 
clock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter. Well 
powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock!

Now there's a good idea ! All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, and
a good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of the
same idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I take
along in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.
I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
duty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).

An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the battery
and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
then I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)

How about rec.radio.amateur.packet?  At least at my site, there is no
general packet radio (i.e. non-amateur) newsgroup.

That said, I would definately subscribe to r.r.a.packet if you want to
learn about all aspects of amateur packet radio, at both the high and
low ends.  Also, I would get the FAQ from the group, and then post any
specific questions to that group.  Everything I could tell you is 
probably in the FAQ, and the people who really know what's going on all
seem to be on r.r.a.packet (although they might be here too, you never know :)

Hope it helps...

Try the folks at Dimolex Corp., La Crescenta, CA 91214.
Their number is (818) 957-7001.  They make membrane keypads
that are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys.  They
have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes
under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as
backlit models.  Some of them can even be cut with scissors
to form a funky shape other than a rectangle.  Many of the
models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel,
colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make
your own layout.  One piece prices aren't cheap, though,
as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45
for a 40 position *kit*.

I have no affiliation with Dimolex or any company connected
with them.  I *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,
and am pleased with what I got.

Hi all,

I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd
like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to
use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation
consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.

We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes,
and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control
circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.

I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the
cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one
problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be
a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute,
so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid
cuetape!)

Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function.
(A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film)
This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second.
What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay
for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay
is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit
of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured
out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!


Thanks,

Mark Fontana

I am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from

in doing this?  The specs call for a few sequences to be met before
standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
I thought that I had it worked out.  However, with a 32kHz crystal the
lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is
three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting
to create.

I have done the following things:

1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is
   low during this time.


2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or
   WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks very much,

   This is called silver bearing solder.   It is used to solder to
devices that have silvered contacts.   One application is soldering
to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These
were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.
If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated
solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be
disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts
are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.

There are a number of inaccuracies here:
1) In fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  This is why
   batteries should be stored in a COOL, dry place.
2) An battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
   on wood.  The battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the
   same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
   none will effect the other.

There is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  Just keep it charged.  (A trickle

NOT ALL PARALLEL PORTS ARE BI-DIRECTIONAL WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

My experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
original 286s proves that.  They had the input direction disactiviated by 
tieing them R/W select line of the circuit to Vcc.  To make it bi ( which 
I did ) I had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
the proper location.  I thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
Zenith ( they were not Zenith-Bull Group at that time).

Pink noise is a random signal with more low-frequency components
than white noise.

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency
analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which
means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.

Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass
filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more
low-frequency components.

The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring
animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will
explain you why.

Enjoy it.

Hi,

   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor
voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 
260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases
and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output
voltage as possible. (about 260v).
  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages
(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v
across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.
  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.
 If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will
increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.
These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of
them, So:

1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel 
with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?
  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase
the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more
stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...
as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new
capacitor will 'smooth' this out.

and
2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to
be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out
the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !

  I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH
of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my 
dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not
playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long
run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

Email please.... Can't always read the net.....

Thanks in advance..

I am making a search for a CAD program that does a decent job

MS-DOS, Windows if possible.

What I want the CAD program to do is to draw diagrams by
dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements
needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ICs (case with pins).
It also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
components as well as their values.  In other words I want to
produce quality drawings.  Printout would be to either 24 pin
dot-matrix and/or Laser Printer.

If you know of such a CAD program that is of reasonable cost,
please respond.

    as a point of info, some of the early nuclear power plants in this

then had a second stage -fossil fuel- step to get the water (actually
steam) VERY HOT.

   I remember seeing this at Con Edison's Indian Point #1 power plant,

I missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or

If line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available
that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also
has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  LM1037, I think?

Good point...also, I wouldn't be surprised that the components

An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.
The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.

Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though
the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive 
heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component
regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is
because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....

From what I know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). Things
like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
even lightning strikes are very likely and I don't think you like to see
the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [Even ethernet cards are
protected. I've looked at the one in my PC and the connector is
protected by a gas discharge tube!]

{But if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
them.}

Suggestion: look in the RS data book. They have several RS232
transceivers that have overvoltage protection. Among them include the
LT1080, LT1081 and MAX250 and MAX251. The Maxims are suppose to be
electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
ask me why. I've never used them before.

Another alternative is an RS232 surge protector. Two are listed in the
RS catalogue. If you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
me.

His question is about some 18-24"" diameter balls which are attached to

two poles.  Neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.
My only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.

Anyone know what they really are?  Is there a related FAQ for this?
Is there a better group to submit to?

We'd both appreciate some enlightenment.

Sometimes.  It depends on your monitor and your timing.  If you don't
have enough vertical front porch and you use XOR composite sync you can
get even/odd tearing at the top of the screen, which is very sensitive
to the HHOLD control.  It looks like what you would expect if you
scanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the
upper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. 
With proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock
solid.

I'm no expert at UPS's, but you said something that made it sound like
you didn't realize something.  On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),
there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is
ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual 
condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal - 
the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but 
there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it 
takes a while).

If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,
why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw
things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC
on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when
you ""need"" it.

Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least
SOME of this helped.

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

Assuming 68HC11...
In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM
controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you
could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh
address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd
timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.

Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which
has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one
of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664
DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only
another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256
DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).

It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actually
about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip... I've got 8 256k simms... that's
2 megabytes on my Apple //e... (used to be in my '386).

Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station
with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors
including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time
dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational 
equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows
where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a 
broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the
receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
unit.

The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series
of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will
use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately
305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals
on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system
which has stations all across the US.

The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.
Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.

The Fujitsu 2322 uses what is known as an 'SMD' interface (Storage Module
Device?).  A lot of older minis used it.  Sun still does on their server
models.  There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the 
Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There
used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in
Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up.
Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses
though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but
I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words,
if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.

A 1 of 4 decoder need not be the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer, although
many commercial SSI implementations allow you to use one as such. Strictly,
a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change
state, according to the inputs.

A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which
of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are
three inputs required.

A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable
input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all
outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output
will be low).

An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to
select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your
aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note
that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since
you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left
once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.

A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus
a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use
the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the
four enable lines.

Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the
four final stage decoders.

Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

	Some TV's, including my RCA set at home, uses simple carriers

Brad,
   For an antenna, gain is synonymous with directionality.  The only way 
to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The 
""gain"" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred 
direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.

Very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate
distances ... might be more interesting than my application.  Just a thought,
you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote
control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.  A Hamamatsu
detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give
the current position.  Store and collate this on a computer and you could

Oddly enough, you don't, at least according to the wiring FAQ that
is regularly posted on misc.consumers.house.

A GFCI senses discrepancies between the live and neutral wire currents,
and cuts them both off if a discrepancy is found.  No ground connection
is needed for it to function.

	Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE
have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivity
is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
are larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take more
battery power.  

	Programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.

IN ORDER to get the 15 nS response time you need, you are better off 
going to an ECL slicer which can run off a single +5 or -5.2 V supply, 
you just need to bias or do some level shifting perhaps to get it in the 
range. Check out the ECL 10K books for a simple cheap solution.

It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood):
the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

>Later model 2600

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here.  The 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

>Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for
>their games. 

ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K
games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari
(and others) made much of these ""huge"" cartridges.

>I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I
>would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. 

Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the
bottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.

As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart.  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range, and the writes into another, but all the time this scheme ate into
the *very* scarce ROM address space.

Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5
nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!

The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally
somewhere around 40kHz.  Sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
(radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.

>What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?

It might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous
""sonic estimator"" type devices that do what you want here.  Many are pretty 
cheap too -- <$30.  (In fact, for awhile the Stanley Estimator was selling
for something like $8.  That's the one I bought! :-) )

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
any of the outlet boxes).

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

One of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask
you for a word from page x, line y, and word z, but this is pitifully simple to
remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program, and
some self-rewriting code to confuse some people.  Also, make sure that your
program can not be run out a debugger.

Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,
just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,
you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.
Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with
garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in
some random sector.

Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they
are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the
opposite of what you want.

Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the
machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can
think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it
requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should
be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything
else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once
again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC
checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other
things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a
change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the
program.  Tell them the program is ""VIRUS SECURE"", and remember, you have
helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.

I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't
do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in
the process!). Goodbye.

What is the program that will be sold?

  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the
10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.

  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially
double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.
The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used
previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham
Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.

  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used
at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design
of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).

  While using this would have let me reduce the ""external"" IF count on
receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I
didn't bother with it.

  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2
MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios
actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and
speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data
stream is another matter entirely.

  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a
""beacon"" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow
due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO
also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even
though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes
of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of
a second.

  I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in
and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland
IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the
proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running
low on resources of time, money and energy.

  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW
ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma
Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally
polarized.

  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly
approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and
you might want to carefully consider your ""target"".  If you can't
arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think
you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by
multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.
For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread
spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems.
I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.

I've seen them in surplus stores.  All they are are fluorescent bulbs

As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near
the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope)
exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a
friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.

Hope this helps.

I just got caller-id (except Bell calls it ""call display"" and didn't know
what I was talking about when I asked for ""caller-id"").  I got the
cheapest display box I could find, and hope to convert it to serial out.

The chip used is an 18-pin DIP marked ""CDT 14-285"" and ""1473 9220"".
I presume the 9220 is the date.

I'm hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip, to save
me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope, asking my friends to
call me again and again.

I'll post any interesting replies, and my experiences.

Wow, what a concept!  Does anybody want to speculate on how this
""non-connection"" would fit into the theft of cable services laws?
It seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

Does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this?

For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2

DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the
controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.

The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National
Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would
like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
implement in my circuit.

BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas
Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer
Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM
memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the
power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use
this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

I suspect that the stories are just that, stories.  The voltage can only

car, when your vehicle is at idle, does your car stall? No, the other car
just does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle
was too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed
will drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the
increased amperage requirement.

No.  No.  NOOO!!!

The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it
under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in
it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if
you're grounded in some other way at the same time.  

The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for
the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you
plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly 
measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.  

They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere,
repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things
like sub-panels.)

What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is 
to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact,
depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.

There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and
news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and
you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy
to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in
the future.

There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,
or in your words, ""it DOES have a bearing on...."".

Now, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination
stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,
but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And since
junction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental
effect on linearity.  

a few facts:
-bias points vary with temperature
-junction resist varrie with temp
-Adcom products do NOT run class-A

If you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements
for most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier
warm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for
the output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the drivers
are not switched.

In any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,
betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
(idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with low
distortion and ""good"" sound quality, and high bias results in
warmer operation, all other factors being equal.

	Here is a list I get when I was combing through some microfilm one
day here at Drexel while completely board.  Most of these circuits are
pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice.
	This is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without
having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff (not a good word, but I'm
tired right now).
	Hope you enjoy!

	If you have any additions send them to me and I'll add them to the list
.  They don't have to be from this particular magazine, they just have to be
interesting!

Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that...I sounds to me,
your UPS takes in AC, rectifies it to DC to charge the batteries, and
then takes the battery DC and chops it to AC again, feeding your
equipment.  This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to
switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,
as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.

Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you
lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to
replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and
you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.

Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that
AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to
be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.

Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back
in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they
did back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure you
it'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhaul
everyone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there.

Funny . . . I and most of the detector-owning friends I have, are  
generally able to *REMEMBER* such things as nearby microwave towers and  
radar detectors going off in EXACTLY the same spon EVERY DAY . . ..

I know on I-64 at the Grayson, KY exit, there's a store just off the side  
of the road (think it's a Liquor store . . .) with what must be a security  
system that would make most federal prisons proud.  It's the only thing  
I've ever driven by (besides a cop) that puts my Whistler in ""Oh my God  
he's Right Behind You!!!!"" mode . . ..  I simply ignore the detector and  
use my eyes when I drive by that store . . . 40 seconds later, all's quiet  
on the front and no problem.

Gee, how about an (ahem) ""accelerometer""! Such devices are available from
a variety of sources (one that comes to mind is Bruel & Kjaer if you have
a lot of money to spend). MOst of these sorts of devices output a voltage
proportional to acceleration. You need to know what range you're talking
about though.

I have 2 OMTI 3527 SCSI adapters for sale.  These make an ST-506 RLL drive
look like a SCSI disk drive.  Each adapter will support two RLL drives.  I
have used this model OMTI adapter with my Amiga A500 and a C-Ltd SCSI host
adapter without problems. I'm selling these because I got them about the

used them.  I can't guarantee they will work with every SCSI host adapter.

They are essentially new in box. I paid $150/ea, make me an offer.

During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
to melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air
will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.
There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.

Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies
are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attack
by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property
rather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will save
power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.

The green layer is a solder-mask, and is used to make a finished board
look neat, and to avoid solder bridges, especially when using wave
soldering (or any other mechanized approach). I've seen red mask,
but most that I've seen are green.

A bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask
is put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side
(or just one side) of the board.
A fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green
solder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass
board with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.
Teflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.

I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're
not about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requires
a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. A lot
of companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a real
boardhouse.

What happens is that (I heard this discussed on ""Northern Exposure"") there  
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  
molecules in the concrete.  This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually  
their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete  
combination.

Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES!

Remedy:  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.

	Greetings. There are 3 types of warnings on (US) tapes:

	   buy this tape""

NASA and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
the loudest reported reproduced sound. They used an ""analog"" electrically
controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. If I 
remember correctly it was called a ""modulated air blast transducer"". There
were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 dB @ 80 Hz @ 10 mile
distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc.

The Federal Communications Act of 1934 made it *legal* for you to
operate a radio receiver of any kind, on any frequency (including
X, K, and Ka bands) in the United States.  The Electronic
Communications Privacy Act of 1989(?) restricted the FCA of 1934
by making it illegal to receive the land-mobile telephone service,
including (I believe) cellular phones.  No restriction was placed
on receiving RADAR (or, curiously, cordless phones.)  Enforcement
of the Virginia law is in violation of the FCA of 1934.  If you have
lots of time and money (and a lawyer, which I'm *not*,) you can
argue this in a federal court and try to have the law overturned.

I can hardly wait to see the responses to this one, but somebody

There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the
user is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
(some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different
machine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.  

The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends
on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user 
did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.
No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!

I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's 
conscience should do that.

I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of ""casual""
users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
(It's the truth.  I have ""friends"" who ask me for copies of my latest games
all the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will
discourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my ""friends"" dug up
somewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual
release!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable
the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined
pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread 
that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once
found by authorities.  It is the ""casual"" pirates that the copy protection is
determined to discourage.

What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.
Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is
encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus
violated their license agreement.

This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal 
discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only
problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.

The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand,
the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is 
supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not 
supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course,
a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?

Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,
though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't
decide to talk at the _exact same time_.

Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to ""something""
that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it
used to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS
or slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more
than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be
able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)

You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,
though.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4
RS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.

Probably won't help.  I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer
used those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them.
Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)

The module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It
contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator
all in a tiny metal can.

If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can
probably order one.  BTW - the carrier frequency is 40 KHz, and each
different TV/VCR/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.

The curiosities that you speak of are EL (Electro-Luminescent) pads.  They
are mostly used as backlights for LCD's, and as you pointed out, comes
in several different colors.  Many of them emit white-ish colors (""true""
white, and blue-whiteis-blue are the ones that I've personally encountered
the most often.)

They vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at 
about 100 Vrms, and at much higher than 60 Hz.  (400 Hz to 1 kHz, if I 
recall correctly.)   You can get them to work at 120 Vrms, 60 Hz (i.e.,
line) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster.
(Oh yes, almost forgot, EL's have this tendency to wear out over time...)

I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program
is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be
distributing the stripped version is well under a week.

Hardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate 
your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
connections to ""real"" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your ""check for the 
hole"" code.

You may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad
higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few
potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose
numbers don't change with the price).

As for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just
have this ""thing"" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,
so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully
low.

It sounds like your TV is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
protection.  (Poor you!)

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you 
souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of 
copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to 
the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
protection.

One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape 
for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an 
extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR 
first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I 
don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want 
to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.

   I thought the first thread was hilarious, so here goes another post.

Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.

  One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.  
They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding
lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the 
riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries 
was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered
that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all
worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced 
about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored
in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)
  Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts.
one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and
discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries
dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said ""HMMMMMMMM"" and 
the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned)
the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They
were the same.  
   Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead
acid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only
needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they
worked fine for around 25 of 'em. 
  This leads me to believe one of several things.
     1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)
     2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
        batteries.
     3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the 
          room where the concrete is, 
     4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
         better than concrete.

(BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)  

   Any other ideas?

    I have a mystery part labeled NEC AC100.  It's from the low voltage

is labeled CR691 where the part goes.  (Possibly an SCR?)  The pin
labeled G on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); the
pin labeled T1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power

rectifier in the supply.

1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual
certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
control's zero detent position.

2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many
generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest
flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector
on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out
.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may
also find that loading the output of the function generator also
reduces the harmonic distortion.

Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to
use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:

------10K--------+---------? ohm ----

Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.
(loaded)         |
-----------------+-------------------

Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy
to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can
virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the
millivolt test generator you want.

Good luck,

The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom had

audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they

I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
something is assembled.  This is especially true for something as

I'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years.
Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to

	Typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap
FIR, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit.  At this kind
of speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less
expensive than analog components of comparable precision.

	I gleaned this information from a hardware manual for
an old CD player design; where one would find similar info for
a particular CD (the digital filter IS an interesting component,
from my point of view), I have no idea.  The digital filter
is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical 
analysis, to see just how BROAD the term 'interpolation' is...),

The make some amazing IRLED's.  The really high-powered devices are arrays of

designed as illuminators for IR vision systems.

Blue lights. Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the
spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).

possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people
with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up
most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things
to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not
work as well, if it worked at all. (lecture on basic atomic physics
fits in here, about electron transitions (quantum leaps) and stuff.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to
have a ""dirty"" amp.

   Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs

Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow
down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.

   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
   Good instructions are included with the chokes.
   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

And please remember to be friendly when approaching your
local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the 
cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation
and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most
are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes
dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost
pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.
interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  

BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or
not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of
being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.
Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers
to take any precautions.

Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are
required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more
than 10).  So if you hear ""This is WA1QT"" or some other call starting
with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.
CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required
to) and fire/police have other private ids.

I'm not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a ""reasonable use"" exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it's okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it's only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

Digi-Key also sells Quad Line Receivers, parts DS1489AN (68cents) and DS1489N
(48cents).  A Quad Line Driver, part DS1488 (48cents), is also sold.  I guess
if you don't won't to supply +12V, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
be worth the extra cost.  But 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly

Mike, Ring is the RED wire. Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard
phone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost
connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.

Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to
GREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the
voltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position).
I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too
much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere).

Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts
DC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current
loop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential
of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).

Hope that clears things...

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem
to remember that PeP is actually 4x the ""real"" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP
actually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.

""Effective transmitted power"" is also ""odd"", in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry.  Which is why a TV station with a 50KW Klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
CN tower ;-).

This is like Sears HP ;-)

Though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  About 125-150A with
a 12V alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.

It's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies).  You'll
feel it when you hit the key.  But not too much.

	This is not a good idea.. I upgraded my motherboard last fall.  I
would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because I changed motherboards.

	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum.  Are you
going to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb
of RAM to their computer?  I did that a couple of weeks ago.  It's in the
BIOS, and if software had told me ""this isn't the machine you installed me
on"" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.

> I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's

	This is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give
them that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.

> You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable

	Do you know any assembly language at all?  All anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction
to just completely skip it.  Not that difficult, really!  And there is very
little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or
some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE
were tagged as uncompressable.

	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.  Making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the
determined ones are just going to answer ""Joe Blow"" to the question of
""what's your name"" so this won't stop them in the long run.

	Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more
time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme.

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. That's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the battery
thermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will
self-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to ""shallow-
cycle"" the charge in the battery. Such mild ""exercising"" of a lead-acid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new battery
in a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for   
storage.

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent
toner, like HP's ""Microfine"" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output,
but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet
output is definitely superior.  

On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use
the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
worse than a bubblejet. :-)

One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets.
There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
(such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good
looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of
the really good style bubblejets.

P.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can
highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable
Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).  With the DeskJet
Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!

I hate to disagree, but I will. :)
(note: I don't pirate software, nor do I trade it. I simply have met and
talked extensively with those who have. that's it. the FBI can tap someone
else's phone :)
Most pirating is done by people who don't use the programs they pirate.
A cracked program tends to get passed on, resplendant in the various graphics
and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s).

I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'
copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use
on one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most
spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had
someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?

It's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to
use and they feel justified in making a copy since ""someone's already paid
for it"", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much
though.)

>If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that

what about commercially available copy programs? CopyII?
how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't?
and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy
wouldn't know about this:
  after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that
the 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least
200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down
and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who
are doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few
arguments to the dir command.

>I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*

really? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster,
but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you
jump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through
faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty
index too!

But I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written
down.

what if they need to re-install? The idea of a backup still holds- if
the original disk goes bad, they're out of luck for about 1-2 weeks, which
is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks-
if they'll do it without a charge.

There are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.

When a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
National MM-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). Now, if you
have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.

The old GE thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
SCR and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
example.

	Yes there is.  Not common for CB.  The pattern is different (sort of
	a cloverleaf, with four main lobes.

	Use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (The

	I reccomend the ARRL Antenna Handbook, or a good basic book.

If you want slow LED flash rates, adjustable by switches (or by a
4066/4016 digitally controlled switch), I suggest looking at a 555
oscillator chip. They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in
quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info
about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest
Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with
resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math
to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a
555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate
doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz
to about 500 KHz (I think).

About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to
use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio
line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.

The data line is probably most easily done
by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565
chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing
about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp
information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack
info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.
Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I
would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is
going into, so I am really generalizing...

As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I
suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would
be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making.
Hope that clears things......

	Uh oh...
	Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve
modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new
ways to ""crack"" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact
is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or
less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good
one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions,
assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea,
legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications, and are merely curious?
	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I
can.

	Incidentally, the ""Uh oh..."" at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it

This is vague, so I am posting it in case anyone else knows more.

I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.
Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder
than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out
pretty quickly though.

Imprecise. This description

 1. ignores the role of the ballast,
 2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.

The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts
short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less
heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to
the neon discharge.

The starter contacts open before the tube fires.  Actually,
the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast
because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.

A capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
excessive arcing during the firing.  The neon reionizes but does not draw
sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.

You should be clear in your mind what your goal is. Two possible goals
are (1) maximizing you income from your program, and (2) minimizing
the number of illegal copies which get created. Accomplishing (2)
doesn't usually accomplish (1).

Most vendors have concluded that copy protection reduces the number of
normal legitimate sales by far more than it increase sales by virtue
of changing 'copiers' to 'purchasers', and hence merely reduces
revenue.  Most legitimate buyers nowadays (including me) have had bad
experiences with copy protected products (e.g., hard to make a
legitimate backup, incompatabilties when new system on system upgrade,
etc.), and they won't touch them with a ten foot pole.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the

no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

The color of the board shows the composition of it, hence the use of it.

Original and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown.
Phenolic (spelling) was a tan
Most ""non filled"" fiberglass boards used in computers are green.
Filled fiberglass is blue.
Teflon is white.

As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them.  First boards were
used mainly in audio circuitry.  Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because
it would arc and burn.  Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen
by its use and cost.  

Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the
fiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a 
capacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the
high frequencies.

Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections
is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of
the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses.  Camcorders use this
to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.

Am working on a generator made by Hewlet Packard right now and the entire board
is gold plated, boy it looks expensive!!!

Hope I got most of my facts right as I am working from memory of material read.

My education was pre-transister!

What, pray tell, are you putting together?  And what about costs?  And does it
have to be transparent as in totally transparent?  Or just transparent enough
to allow light from the other side to shine through?

You take two copies with a different registration id, compare them byte for

Sci.E(E) netters:

I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
requires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are working 
fine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are so 
cheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding any 
LCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  I 
am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
1000-10,000.

Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a part 
number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
they find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
quantity.

I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see whole 
calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This 
$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processor 
chip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.

If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
distributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.

P.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
have LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone else 
had better luck with this strategy?

No need to be sorry, I blew it on this one.  At the main breaker box
where there is a thick wire ground leading to the earth, both neutral
and ground are hooked to this bus.  In any other breaker box (or an
outlet box, etc.) the ground and neutral must not be connected together.

If you put another computer on the port instead of the key, you can hack 
them by reading what happens. So I've been told, I've never seen this done 
but I think it's possible. You'd need some hardware knowledge and some 
software to read the port!

Well, I'm not sure I'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
filter DSP construction article in the Sept 92 issue of QST magazine (Ham Radio
oriented).  The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.

This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code is
available too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note that
this is for communication applications and is not ""high fidelity"".

The rule for the designations is that if it says MC, that means it works
*exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  If it says XC, that means
there is at least one known bug.  Often these bugs are small and obscure;
you might never run into them in practice.

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is
supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest
looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
power and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now own
the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities
you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...

There's a ""wiring"" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believe
an alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure what
current code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate
(unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific
protective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in the
protected circuit.  GFCI breakers are available (but expensive).

Judging by your .sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge.
Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available
via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.

Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'.
To do this simply:
1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM
burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into
one file yourself with suitable gaps.)
2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game
console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.

To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'
is simply another address line.

For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would
wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches
would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.

Maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. The MAX7219 drives 8
7 segment LED displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete LED's with
a 3 wire serial interface.  The chips can also be cascaded to allow very
large arrays.  I am working on a sign display using this part.

I'll have to post the contact info for Maxim later, it's at home.  There was
a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of Circuit Cellar Ink's.

I'll toss in my 2 cents worth - I've begun to think that distribution
disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.
We've been especially plagued by Borland's distribution disks.  I'm 
lucky if I can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap 
out on me.  So definitely, as a matter of course we ALWAYS make copies
to do our installations with.

	Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part
because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure
of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just
exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products
is that this matches a hardware optimization.

	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has
TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term)
so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can 
be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world.
ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND
gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and
inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).

	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT
gates (with your choice of internal connections between the
various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum
of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into 
a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization
of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to
do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist
with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of
a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software
does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding
it all out, then simplifying.

For those who would like to know, the 6507 was a 6502 without IRQ or NMI,
and with only 13 address lines (giving 8K memory space).

Didn't know about it being called the 6526 - thats the CIA found in the
Commodore 64 (I don't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around).
The TIA was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in the
bottom 128 bytes of page 1. To get an image on the screen, you had to wait
until the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line
into the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many
duplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This
took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the
display.

>There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
>regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page
1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is
both shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a
machine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it
also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the
high byte of the address is hardwired to 1).

The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers
(can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the
6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I
think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so
many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do
something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.

There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at
least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I
imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly
to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so
the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly
normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more
usual active low chip select.

No.  The blue LEDs sold down the street are in milky-white plastic.  

And, fyi, putting a filter on a ""typical visible light LED"" (presumably meaning

I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive
ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.
You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When
someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
rings instead of long rings.

You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.
A device would measure the length of rings.  When it
detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
Five rings later your fax picks up the call.

This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
switches now available.

But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new
# to my friends and customers.  This should leave the
old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the
phone when I hear the long rings.

Originator: dgj2y@kelvin.seas.Virginia.EDU

	I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks by
buying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhile
I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there
seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,
I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
random 50mV bias.
	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed
from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input
impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have
maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have
input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to
use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing
reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now
with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of
a pain in  the ass.
	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could
solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator
input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor
of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd
like to have this box not be active.
	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I
had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. The
function generator was the same way on that one, too.

	Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than
most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least)
all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at
much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.  The 'increase'
of wiring capacitance is not really relevant (you have to use
transmission line techniques, and the capacitance is no problem).

	Hand-powered is a terrible choice (IMHO) unless you are
a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections
at a time.  Your hands will cramp.  Battery-powered wire-wrap guns
are available in the $150 range, and so are the little
twiddle-stick manual types ($15).  For a modest project, of
a couple hundred connections, I'd prefer to borrow a professional
AC unit... or a pneumatic one.

Hello,

Can somebody tell me what kind of MOV's are most useful for a computer
surge protector?  Radio Shack have 2 types, both rated 130V, one for
a 10A current and the other for 20A.  On the other hand, commercial surge
protectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330V-400V, which SEEMS to
me in imply a rated voltage of about 250V (250V * SQRT(2.)=353).

What is the right kind?

While at it, ow important is really the EMI/RFI module?  Is there really any
noticable level of such noise in the power line?

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and word has it that
something similar is on its way here.  Since we apparently
don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing
cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests
are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the
video being piped into a command center they're building
somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or
cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large
multi-colored status displays will show the various routes
using different colors to represent the various average speeds
for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front
of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic
status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also
looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to
providing continuous audio from this system.

In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display
boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data
on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the
system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it
will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is
similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read
""cheap"").

We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP
audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal
reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle
receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is
applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some
other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your
stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station
jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.
I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle
receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly
fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers
don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely
true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system
up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You
may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing
more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)

I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more
info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

Here in the UK, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. Private
lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.

Don't quote me on that..... But I think I remember a BT engineer 
saying something to that effect when I was doing some work
shadowing a few years ago.

I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no
  amp which can touch it at the price range.
The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other 
  amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid
  with massive heat sinks and very solid casing.
If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components 
  in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect
  symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each
  channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are
  virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.

I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east
  or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components
  they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the
  amplifiers sound so brilliant.
I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with
  those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly
  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like
  the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded
  like new.

If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will
  sound brilliant and last a long time - period.

Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.

A verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  I had the pleasure of
doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my B&D heavy duty at
full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 MPH.  Now if you go
a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 MPH out of
it.  (If you speedo doesn't burn out.)  Anyways, to roll a 100000 Mile
odometer would take 22 days or so.  Much easier just to take the speedo
apart.

Thought I'd share.  BTW, all this info was obtained legally  :-)

         A while ago I saw some translucent pads, about 6""x8"" or so that

another green, another blue.  Interresting.  I was wondering if anyone

   oh, the pads were rubber-like and were floppy like, about 1cm thick or

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series
between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.

Open it up and look for the power amp ""ICs"".  They'll be fairly obvious. 
Replace the one connected to the dead output.

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the
input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both
chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  

If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an
outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and
balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of
the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably 
before the other controls).  

If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should
probably forget the whole thing.

I'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need Direct

line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the run
to the mixer.  Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm going
to need like 5 or 10 of them!  I looked inside one (belonging to
another band) and it looks like just a transformer.  Does anyone have

I guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).

Or: Get an 8-bit DA-Converter (merely a couple of transistors and
Resistors) and an OpAmp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
the rest by software (stepwise refinement). The port addresses for your
printer ports are probably: &H378 (LPT1), &H278 (LPT2). This should work
well enough for your purposes.

Hope this helps

Here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. The cable tv companies  
even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable  
tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency  
conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  
into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look  
for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or  
the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far  
bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an  
administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they  
get...
The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  
rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get  
out of our freqencies.

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring
and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener
and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever
scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on 
the frontend.

Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets
dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly
12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that
far down is probably a big no-no.

The easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

This is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you

From my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet 
circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving 
a fixed intermediate frequency (IF) that is more easily amplified. The
detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar 
detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there 
are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't 
paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF. 

I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and 
how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector 
in a proper RF shielded enclosure.

I, too, have a XC68882RC50 math coprocessor, which I installed
succesfully in my Mega Midget Racer (clocked at 33 MHz). I have tried
clocking my FPU at 28 to 50 MHz and it all worked just fine. I have a

Or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  A lot of shareware out there is 
very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  Perhaps even 
support of some small degree.  Whatever you want to offer that is ""better"" 
than the circulating version.

It doesn't really hurt legit users.  Shareware is still much cheaper than

Hi people..

OK heres my problem.... 
I keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which
detect IR light....

I believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal (visible) light
and then if they are exposed to IR light they glow or something like
that...

I think that they are avaliable in the states and even in England, but
alas I live in Australia.  Could someone please inform me if I can get
these things over here, and if so where??? and how much???

Also are they really commonly avaliable in the states, and if so, then
how much are they and who sells them (maybe if I cant get one here, I'll
write to one of the companies over seas..)

Anyway.... Thanks in advance...

I strongly disagree. I think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't
copy the program if ""diskcopy"" can't do it.
If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will
suffice.
I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*
because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.

Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
backup copy? Almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. I think its a waste
of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to ""lend""
out the backups. 


No flames intended - just my thoughts.

An ideal item would be an LED array for which each LED is about 1/2"" square.

Hi folks,

I borrowed a VHS tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the

processes. However, I've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so I don't 
want to take the chance even it's small.

Anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes?

I remember a program called Copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser 
hole in it. I think it simulates the laser hole. After copying the disk the 
program is, if necessary, used in conjunction with a program called Nokey or 
something. (The program tells you which program to use)

More than Talk:  From the FCC Rules:  73.4250 Subliminal Perception:

(a) See Public Notice, FCC 74-78, dated January 24, 1974, 44 FCC 2d, 1016; 39
Fr 3714, January 29, 1974.
(b) See FCC Information Bulletin, ""Subliminal Projection"" (sic, at least in my
rules service copy of the rules), dated November 1977.

Since I don't have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information
Bulletin around, I can't tell you what you can't do on TV ( or radio) but I
seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s. 

Practically speaking, I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits
in MTV promos,  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such, but
maby that's just because the contrast between the single frame and the
surrounding material was significant.  I never believed in the one-frame type
of SP being real.  

On the other hand, the Coca-Cola or Brand (insert desired name here) beer cans
conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched,
that's another story, and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer
company for the privilege of doing that, there has to be a ""Promotional
Consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program; but if
the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company
and didn't get any of the payment for ""brand visibility"" that the film company
got, then they don't have to run the message.

I had a GE Emerson 13"" color TV for about 3 years and one fine day,
while we were watching something (I doubt if the program was the cause),
we heard a mild explosion.   Our screen went blank but there was sound,
so we thought, 'oh we have special effects on the program'.  But soon
the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the TV.
The brilliant EEs we are, we unplugged the TV and called customer service
only to be thrown around by please hold, I will transfer u to blah blah..
  Finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the TV and got a new one
(we wanted a bigger one too!).
 After all the story, what I wanted to know is: Is my problem an isolated
incident or a common one? (I recall reading about Russian TVs exploding, but
not here, in the US). Why would the picture tube explode or even smoke?
 I still have the left over TV set, I might dig into it this summer. Any
idea where I can get parts for these things? (probably will cost more than TV).

First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors,
transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla
coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean
an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla
coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for
diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called
""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly
efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,
which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active
reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve
efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core
resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI
for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer
screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil
from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all
Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter
and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind
to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,
gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and
telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????

GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE
TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!

If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.

With regards to what you wrote, how does one ""adjust for room dynamics 
and stuff like that""?  I asked a professor that question just
last week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed
to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's
a lack of a covalent bond) that act as ""traps"" to nearby elecrons, and since
this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't
able to ""trap"" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me
that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the
""pink noise"" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering
how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
""man made noise"" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have
any information about this, it would be appreciated.  Hope this didn't sound
too drawn out.  Thanx.

Here's the scoop.  When you get your home brew receiver working, would
you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  I always wanted to
build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.

pin 1:  signal ground
pin 2:  signal
pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors

The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There
is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to
ground.

The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver.
They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would
imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
it as the external receiver.

If you need more info, let me know.

I've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
systolic array chip that had 50pF loads on the clock lines.
(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.)
Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:

1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 

2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load
	on the clock lines. 

3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high
	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large.
	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly
	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably
	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).

4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I
	needed.

Does anyone know if a source for the TCM3105 modem chips (as used in the
Baycom and my PMP modems)?  Ideally, something that is geared toward 
hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.

For years, we've been buying them from a distributor (Marshall) by the
hundreds for PMP kits.  But orders have dropped to the point where we can
no longer afford to offer this service.  And all of the distributors I've
checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).

I'd like to find a source for those still interested in building PMP kits.
Any suggestions?

It is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
or for an illegal use.  Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no
other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 

The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.
The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have
enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.

When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, 
explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an
association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.
(I promise I am not making this up!)

I do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
raiser aspect of tickets.

Hello,

I just canceled my support of the Cable Regime and I would like to at
least pick up the 3 networks and NBC.  :)   I do not have tons of
money nor even a few pounds so what I am looking for is the best solution
for reception for under 100 dollars.  I have seen modules that you plug
into your wall outlet that ""supposedly"" make your entire house an
antenna.  I have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for ""excellent
reception"" at best.  I'll try anything, though, if it WORKS.  I am in
a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations
which are pretty large (Montgomery Alabama pop. 200,000) and Colombus Goergia,
pop. 100,000+.  Any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and 
company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)?  Thank you in
advance.

Dear Netters
I want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. 
Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each
running person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred 
meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is
about 150MHz and about 440MHz.
To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best 
the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather 
specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-
units i need.
On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I 
need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  
receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers 
as needed in the particular case.
DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER 
SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?

Since your MOSFET is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
today's standards.  If you have an idea about its voltage and current 
ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating 
of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely ""ON"" 
at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is 
used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without
any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box
labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one
in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some 
fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason
for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).

I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd
bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind 
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (Q dope
for coils *does* not improve the Q--it just holds things together with
minimal loss).

I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection.
As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is
impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a
CD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.

Hmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe
disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You
would need a tonne of disks though.

I remember, back before commercial mikes with the ""PZM"" label (for
Pressure Zone Microphone) started showing up, I read an article,
in some engineering journal, that described the principles involved.
All the physics aside, from a practicle standpoint the author's said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small Sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk.  In demonstrating it at
a presentation to audio engineers, this was impressive enough that
the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.

Anyway...I want to build some to use as ""choir mikes"" (wide coverage).
I've had good luck using some small electret mike elements I got
from Digi-Key - most of these are limited-bandwidth, peakey units
but for a buck or two more I got the ones spec'd to go out to 20kHz
with a bit flatter response.  

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of
critical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, which
puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a
small clearance.  I haven't dissected a unit like you can buy at
Radio Shack to see how they do it.  Thoughts?

I was a bit surprised that the manual for my Fluke-87 multimeter
suggests applying WD-40 to the test lead sockets, especially the
current range socket.  The intention is to prevent the
test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there
is no test lead in that socket.

The manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to a
swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly
from the can.

Speaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that
I've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five years
since the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agree
within .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would be
just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I
didn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I
don't use dB all that much in my work.

off-ramp on the freeways. They're the same sensors used at most stoplights
now (coils in the pavement). You might want to give CalTrans a call or

My own practice with new software :

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies.

install to hard drive from second set of floppies.

put originals in a box in room number one.

put copies in box in room number two.

1) Accidents DO happen to original floppies.
2) Accidents CAN happen to the installation floppy.
3) Sometimes software goes out on floppies that are JUST marginally good.  Or
   gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage.

I've had experience with SOMETHING like the last.  I purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor.  THe debugger in the package just would NOT install to the
hard drive. NO WAY.  Repeated floppy-to-floppy copies FINALLY got a clean read
of the disk.  I DON'T recall if I used ""diskcopy"", ""copy/b"", or ""xcopy"".

I made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that.  No problenms ( except with my typing :-)  ) since.

I regard backup floppies as CHEAP insurance.

Just my side of the question...

I'm glad to see this idea come up because I've had something similar in mind.
What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address 
data.  When the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code, 
just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the 
appropriate place the following:

Name=Joe Doe
Address=123 Main Street
City=Anytown, CA
key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd

Every user needs a unique key.  The executable can propagate as much as you 
like, the author can respond to the registration by e-mail, post card, 
whatever.  Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name 
showing up (maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message).  
Authorized users can make as many copies as they like, upgrade their 
machines, whatever.  The main motivation here is guilt and irritation at 
seeing someone other than yourself as the ""registered owner"".

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs
for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt
radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.
If you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station
nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio 
transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are
correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.

If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite
chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably
being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
Good instructions are included with the chokes.
If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof
or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things
a radio operator can do to reduce interference.

That's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do.
IMHO it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as
possible AND to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain-deads)
, quick reference books, how to do books and videos, paid support hot line
(1-900 :).  For the registered purchasers, these can be part of their package.
I have seen many books to teach people how to use DOS, WP and other software.  I
I suspect either users can't read the manuals or they don't have manuals.
Either way, there is $$$ to be made.   BTW books are quite a bit more
expensive to reproduce than a $1 disk.

With the popularity of Multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems
(eg. OS0.5, Windoze, Mack System 7), it is pretty easy to run a debugger
and figure out the protection schemes by disassembling/tracing/trapping
the application during run time.  Schemes like compressed software/
special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.

Hardware keys (unless well designed and *TOTALLY* transparent) is a
pain in the b*t.  We having using a piece of software under Windoze
that uses a hardware key.  The key interfers with the printer stuff
with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software
to work properly.

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]
Lines: 28


	Being in the ""visualization"" stage of a circuit design right now,
I was wondering what the best way to ""scale"" an AC voltage using an 8-bit
digital word is. I am thinking of using the common method of sending the
word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (converted
to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of this
method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)
creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I
realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,
but that would require more parts and boost the price further.
	Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8
bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip.
Unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;
if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.
	I am building this project as a ""dimmer box"" for a light
controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains
very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user
wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each box
costs $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 =
$2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed about
today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive!
	Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of
easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always
the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!

TriQuint (Beaverton, Oregon), has been selling an 8 bit, 1 GHz D to A
for several years.  I have used it and it works well, faster settling
time and smaller glitch area than any video d DACs I have seen.  Also,
they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale
now - it's somewhere in the 10 to 12 bit area at 1 GHz.

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics:
Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by
Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks
about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in
BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to
use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical
Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some
millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has
appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,
etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

Re: RMS readings

Unless the DVM *says* it's measuring RMS, it's probably Average voltage.
The input is diode rectified and measured as DC.  If it says it's RMS
and but measures square/triangle/etc.  incorrectly, it's measuring
average and multipling by a correction that's *only* true for sine waves
(i.e.  Vave*(0.707/0.63) = Vrms).  If you want correct RMS for (most)
any waveform, you need a ""True-RMS"" DVM/DMM which literally does the
Root-Mean-Square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry.

It's NOT the concrete floor that does it. The problem is that lead-acid
cells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance)
will discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells
self discharge even faster. If the battery was not completly charged
when left sitting, it probably discharged past the the point where cell
sulfiding occurs, which in many cases means a ruined battery.

DEC did this on their new alpha chip.  I'm sure you could call them up

Actually, there are some details in their article in IEEE Journal of

Nope.  Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks.

You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try
strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out,
which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're
going to need a bigger generator.

I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out
of the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.

I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of
work, and not with the pro-audio people.  Also, I recommend that you don't
try to tap into junction boxes at all, but hire a licensed electrician if
you don't really know what you are doing.  I've had to clean up after two
people who nearly killed themselves playing in hot 200A boxes, and it wasn't

RS Components (they exist in Australia and the UK. Don't know about the US) have

a single 5V supply. External components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode,

You can design for ramp shutoff, brick-wall current limit or even 
fold-back cutoff....sounds like you want ""BRICK-WALL"" current limit.

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
drive. In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on 
the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing 
resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense 
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation 
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??

Unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  The most common method of
implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  The
local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
care.

For a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _Spy Catcher_.
The author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for British
Intelligence.

The STANDARD AT bus (ISA) runs at 8MHz, not 12.5 MHz, but some 
non-stnadard ISA buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  For instance, my 
486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do 
AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.

The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may 
have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  

33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.  FYI: the AT bus 
operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.

The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a
ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through
the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The
sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
draft generation.

It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at 
locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,
usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically
takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.

Um...

1) Your Professor if just plain wrong.  Although blue LEDs are one heck of
a lot less efficient than red ones.
2) ""Typical visible light LEDs"" don't really exist.  LEDs have a fairly
narrow region of transmittence.  (Since the Fermi energy around either side
of the band gap falls off exponentially, blah, blah...)

>Source: Solid State Electronic Devices (Ben G. Streetman, 3d ed., Prentice

You might want to check the copyright date on that. :-)

Blue LEDs most certainly do exist, I've got a bunch at work.  Cree Research
makes them (probably along with other companies...  Cree is big in
materials science, though; they advertise in the stuff like Physics Today,
etc.).  You can buy them from JameCo (I think), DigiKey (definitely), and
plenty of other distributors.

Actually, these days you _can_ get a ""typical visible light"" LED -- it's
called a ""rainbow LED"", and I've forgotten who makes it (they advertise in
EDN and many of the other trade rags, though).  It combines a reg, green,
and blue LED all on one chip (and has four leads).  Nifty device, although
it's probably fairly expensive.

They are illegal here in Manitoba as well though I don't know what

It has always amazed me with the way the laws work.  It is not illegal to

I would suggest Draw for Windows (by Micrografx).  I have this on my
home box.  Its quite impressive and only cost UKL100.  It has a rather
nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own
drawings.  There is no circuit component clip-art included, but you
could add your own quite easily.

It works with any Windows printer driver of course, and can also
export embedded postscript and PCX files.

Note: I am not connected with Micrografx in any way.

Try a differential amplifier. Put back-to-back diodes between the collectors
restrict the voltage swing. Have 10 mA flow, with 500 ohm collector Rs, and
keep the stray C below 10 pF. Try 2N5179s. Run collector to your logic.

Hmm - I don't think you and I are thinking of the same thing. I was the
original poster, BTW. The accelerator that I'm talking about almost
certainly uses a 68HC000, according to the footnotes in the Supra ad. It
only costs $199 list, so I really doubt if it has a 28 MHz 68030 inside.

It's called the Supra 28, or Supra Turbo 28.
There's an external A500 model, and an internal A2000 model.

BTW, does anyone know if a 28Mhz 68HC010 exists?

I think a few things are being missed overall here... First of all, anyone
with a DOS manual can copy a disk, or copy anything (hidden files dont
go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely DOS ignorant) off
of a hard disk. 'Professional' crackers aren;t interested in copying disks.
They are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly
listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number
dialog boxes, volume label checks, and who knows what when it comes to
computer games. 
    
Those people are in the minority, however. In my experience with the world of
people and software, it seems that a good majority of people (say 80%) will
at some point copy a friend's program (""Gee, you really oughta try this"") or
accept a copy. These are people who normally would buy a software package
or do without, but decided that just once it wouldn't matter.

The last thing is people who own or are responsible for more than one 
computer; most people aren't going to spend $150 * X# of computers for the
same software package.. they will just install it x# of times, especially
things like DOS upgrades.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces
on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,
the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'
""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims
in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...

    width   Temp rise
    inches  degrees C
    ------  ---------
     .125	100
     .15	 75
     .17	 60
     .20	 45
     .24	 30
     .33	 20

At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.
Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes
up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be 
ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the 
required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself, 
I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is
a transient or fault condition.)

(There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?
But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or
just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate
sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)

  Why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)

  I decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and I just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but 
they act like the two terminals are shorted.  I asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them,
but he couldn't tell me why.

Aaahh... a problem very near and dear to my heart. In our case, other
monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be
specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this
problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc
several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the
juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side
of wall maybe?
We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input
lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference
effect on the computer monitor next to it. 
Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very
common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type
O'scopes).
I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount
around deflection coil of interfering monitor. 
BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH
VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T
BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO
MOUNT CAN.
Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also
good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on
monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other
sources.

Hey, now will you stop encouraging him? Copy protection only serves one pur-
pose: to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. It will
definitely not stop any pirates. If you want to protect you soft, supply a
good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively pro-

I am not a battery expert, but from recent reading, a lead acid battery
will self discharge at a relatively high rate, and if stored in a discharged
state, will develop a condition I think is called sulfation.  In storage,
either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance
I'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle
charge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable
if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time.
The refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the
charging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may
only apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid
type.

You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, ""The
Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,"" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source
is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with
ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air
to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are
spaced every 6"" starting about 10"" above the bulb.

Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use
your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may
not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or
racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my
oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a
wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows
for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it
often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are
using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway
through.

If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub
for this stuff.

Acetone will likely damage the carpet. First solvent to try is denatured

alcohol instead of denatured alcohol. If you want to have a cocktail while
you are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol :-). If the alcohol does
not work try carbon tetrachloride. If neither of these work you may need to
try a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. Good luck.

The best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the 
best explanation, but the rest makes sense) A one wave will cancell itself 
out (BTW no such beastie) . The best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 
1/4, then 1/8 etc.

As for SWRing in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. Since the 
wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to SWR 
in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.
Anyway in the beginning of CB's, all new antennas had to be SWR'ed in, 
nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not 
much point in SWRing. Then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
anyway.

The best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready. Perhaps
Postscript or Rich Text Format?

Most commercial switchers do NOT use magnetics for their energy storage;
that's handled by the big caps on the primary side, those which in a 
linearly-regulated power supply would be considered the ""filter"" caps,
coming right after the bridge.  The transformer is just that - a 
transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT
negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
""snubber"" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in.)

The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in
a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a
high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or
""filter"") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor.
The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer,
resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which 
are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor,
which acts in a ""pulse-width modulation"" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying
the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less
tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear
regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the 
regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC)
is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement.

While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these
designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored; besides the inductive ""kick"" giving the switch transistor a
bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another.
In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others,
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't
saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the 
imagination! :-)).

I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer; 
hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above.

Hello--

I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that
it proudly proclaims ""8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING"" on the box.  Now while I think
I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete ""samples""
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),
I don't understand this ""8 TIMES"" business...  It seems to me that when
I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs
said ""4 TIMES"" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting
senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't
I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording
process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate
(from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data
rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean
that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has 
changed since 1983?

I'm so confused...

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I
ask this again:

1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be
   I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?

2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies
   hole currents over normal electron currents?

3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of
   hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual
   test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,
   don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,
   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,
   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).

NOTES:

   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area
   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole
   particles only exist in the presence of matter.
   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain
   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if
   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point
   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).
   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether
   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for
   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such
   currents *if* they exist.
   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics
   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.

Thanx,
Eric.

    Just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles
on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....

    I wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  Not because the engineers at BMW are
putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

   If I were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):

         * Debouncing/deglitching  ( Is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )
         * Smoothing:  The rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                This is a car, not an electron.
         *  Top speed limit:  Anything above 200MPH is ridiculous: must be
                                        electrical noise or contact bounce

    As for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
a BMW dashboard, I seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the

They are one of the largest manufacturers of IC packaging in the

It sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at
least IC probing to test performance.  HP, Cascade Microtech and
Tektronix should be able to help you here.  One note, testing at high

Write a good manual to go with the software.  The hassle of
photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive
but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee
mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.

You're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use
are non-licensed users.

The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
your price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.
Retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying
customers; the software industry is the same.

Unless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly
copy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion.

Not even in sub panels!  The only place the neutral should be connected to the
ground is in a SERVICE DISCONNECT!  In your house the ""main"" panel serves as
the service disconnect.  Sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
disconnect equipment.

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes
X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup.
You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted
onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does
something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely. I wonder
if ANYONE has ever managed to design a single sided PCB with an
8051, 573, EPROM, SRAM and >>NO LINKS<< ?

Thought it means Global Positioning System. There are two precision levels, one  
for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  
ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),  
though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with  
an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the  
same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  
then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  
You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
Your original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)  
idea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't  
know of an address anymore).

Rubbish. The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a ""dry film"" mask applied to them (usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red
or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner. There's a lot of info
about the pro's and con's of each, but that's another story...

They are real, and we still pay licence fees to receive TV.
The detector vans pick up the IF, true. This tells them what channel you
are watching. The can also pick up the line time base freq, and frame rate
(Try it with a LW/MW radio near telly, it picks up a sharp hum)

From this they can even watch (poor quality though) what *you* have on the
screen, by picking up re radiating junk.

Just to complete that thought, the cooling towers cool water that

The reactor has a closed loop circuit to prevent radioactive
contamination of the the turbine feedwater.

The cooling tower is a separate circuit to avoide contamination of
the turbine feedwater with atmospheric contamininats, etc.
Purifying boiler feedwater is important business at both fossil
fired and nuclear generation facilities.

understand it, there's a pin on the chip that, when voltage is applied, kicks
up the address.  The question is how do you determine how many bytes the
address is incremented by??  For example, if I have code I want to be
accessed at $2000 and also at say $4000 how do I move the address pointer to
those positions??  Thanks for any info...

This is just basicly right. The connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. I would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town, there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.
And regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system), that does
just apply to pulsdialing. Not to touchtone.
Btw; Norway is even more interesting. They got both system! So you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.

The only explanation I can think of is that two capacitors in series
can handle twice the output voltage. Sometimes two elco's in antiseries
(you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
one.

Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants
are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling
towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for
coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.

Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when
its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network
of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling
and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the
hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than
just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is
rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently
seen rising out of these towers.

That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because
it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of
the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.

The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam
system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the
boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across
the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and
by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it
back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference
(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot""
turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

Isin't there some kind of rule (regulation, law, whatever) in some

Okay, so what do you do if some part of the machine (presumably the part  
on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself  
upon goes bad, you replace that part, and now your program won't run  
because it's on a ""different"" computer???

This is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like  
the BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number.   
Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.

I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.   
We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred  
machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of  
over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab  
with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with  
admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more  
than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of  
your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.   
""Pirate board"" or no pirate board.  I too have ""friends"" who blatantly and  
quite successfuly ""hack"" copy protection schemes practically in their  
sleep.

Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one  
machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some  
setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,  
mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network  
administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are  
(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and ""acting"" similar to  
the average user, and maintaining ""behind-the-scenes"" consistency is a  
real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty  
different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his  
disk.

Often we have hardware problems at peak ""business"" times and have to do  
some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .

Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..

The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration  
files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found  
to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  
COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  
machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  
ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  
this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  
all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.

Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  
to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  
usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  
the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with ""copy  
protection"" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain  
 . .

In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort  
of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and  
you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's  
guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this  
REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute  
the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but  
please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the  
costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the  
legitimate user with a ""copy protection"" scheme!

Why can't he record it legally?  It may not be admissable in court, but
recording for personal use is legal.  If he wants to play it for his ham

It doesn't actually have to be 1500 watts at 100 feet.  I've heard radio
transmissions from concert security over guitar amps with no guitar plugged
in, and security uses radios transmitting 2-5 watts into a rubber duck antenna,
which acts more like a dummy load than an antenna.

This would be susceptible to fading, multi-path etc. We used to use a
system at the shop made by Tellurometer in South Africa. It used a
10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured.
The 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched
ones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units
came with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and
instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp.
They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end.
Current technology uses polarized reflectors, dual polaization TX/RX
and psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution
at X band, much better at 47GHz. (Only one end is heavy :-)  ).

Open up one of the airbag control boxes.  They have inexpensive piezoelectric
accelerometers in them.  I know that the GM cars use the Setra units.  The
cheapest way to get such an accelerometer is to cannibalize an existing
automotive unit.

Incidentally, these things aren't very linear, but for the application they
would do a fine job.

Hi there,

Does anyone know whether the PUFF RF design package is available
via ftp from any site? As I understand it, it is in the public

Any other PD RF design tools out there that can be recommended?

In making batteries you could use copper and zinc in an acid electrolyte.     
Copper=copper wire (pennies are now mostly zinc if I recall correctly)
zinc= zinc strip (Hardware stores arround here (Seattle) sell this to prevent
      moss buildup on the roof. An alternative would be to use a galvanized
      (zinc coated) nail
electrolyte= lemon juice -> Citric acid is the active ingrediant(sp).
 
Volta (late 18th century scientist) used a stack for his batteries-
copper disk, paper disk soaked in acid, zinc disk, copper disk, paper ....
they were advanced technology for the time.

You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not
interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an
all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's
heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks
that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the
properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at
that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not
unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things
in realtime if you write efficient code.

In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)
filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out
there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs.

Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and
give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they
charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.

I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are
built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"".

Subject: Need help with video detection circuit
Organization: Systems'n'Software
Lines: 55



I am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (Vs.
a blank screen) by monitoring the R,G, and B outputs of a graphics
card.  It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at
65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be
cheap.  

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each
compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my
circuit would not detect it.   

The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.  

There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require 
split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply
circuit.  

At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor
circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing
transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any
ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly
appreciated.  

Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so
I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course,
you will have my undying gratitude.

That's a standby unit not a UPS, otherwise there would be no interuption.

GEC/Plessey specify a series of FM demodulators (SL1454 etc) for use in
satellite TV receivers : 150 or 600MHz in, 10MHz of baseband video out.
I think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended
for use in DMAC decoders, though that isn't used in the most common 
implementation - it may not be in volume production.

The most easily available components probably vary with local satellite
standards, and I think the european systems vary rather widely from those
in the US - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver
designs to find out what's in common use.

It's not the temperature, it's the karma.  You see, dirt has good karma,
since it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared
off and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being
a karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no
longer able to keep a charge.  Because wood is also good and organic, putting
a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.

The Buddha-nature is in the acid, but it is also in the lead plate.  The
novice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or
whether the solid lead had it.  The master handed the novice a 250V B battery,
terminals downward, and thus the novice was enlightened.

While I have gotten 8-9 years out of this digital receiver, it
has been acting VERRY strange of late.  I hope that  the following	
symptoms may help someone diagnose the error:

- i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had - has long died
thus if i unplug it - it won't remember the presets

- it has given up listening to the remote.  (i tried changing the remote's
batteries) when i try a remote function - the receiver registers that it
received it (a green remote light flashes) but the right function
doesn't happen - if any function at all.  (also strange- when i hit 
the ""mute"" button, for example, the display panel goes black - yikes-	
i've never seen that before ...)

- before all the strangeness started, the system turned itself OFF and ON
again - by itself

- sometimes it won't play a radio station, so i have to kinda twist it 
(yes kinda flex the motherboard, chasis) for it to get the radio
tuning back - the aux in function always works however....

it is inconvenient, but NOT inconvenient enough to pay an 
expensive repair fee.  while, i'm not a hardware guy, i wonder 
if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix.
the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go ...

someone told me this unit series has a bad Voltage Amp chip.

I've even seen pictures of an installation where the ham pulled a little

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips
or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer
assembly are tightened properly.  Other than that, my next guess would be one of
the motors.  Hope this helps.

just a suggestion:
take a motorola mc14536B set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
secs with either a RC or xtal clock input. then feed to a MC14521B as clock
input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
cycle... Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.
Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3"" or 4"" of foam or build a box
of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery
and ckts warm.
2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.

Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL
rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction
in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..

hope this helps

The battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold.  The temperature
combined with self-discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of 
the battery.  I strongly suspect that the only reason the battery doesn't
go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
cooler.

I still think a major point is being missed... If you are worried about

software (mostly games, but so what) daily for fun. They can usually find
a crack around anything, especially if the manufacturer leaves a hole for such a thing.

There usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
keep all of their internal numbers private. Depends on your exchange.
Any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
lines that echo the number you called from. The line service guys use this
to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.

It sorta depends on what you drive. I remember running a two channel 
Motorola with a vibrator power supply and about 40 tubes in a 1958 
Volkwagen. The poor little 6 V generator had a heck of a time, and if you 
keyed the mic at night, you needed to be stationary, because your lights 
got AWFUL DIM. Isn't progress wonderful?

Subject: Common-mode noise and small signals
Keywords: noise common mode
Organization: Iowa State University, Ames IA
Lines: 20

I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform 
synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large
common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred 
times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to
make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with 
line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).

How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an
HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to 
'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
input since it will read accurately down to DC.

Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem, 
how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected 
to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for 
use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would
appreciate it.

Digi-key has the NE-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on

For a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best
reference for non-engineers is probably the Radio Amateur's Handbook

I think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) April 1st is over.
I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
""storys"" about them. OK ?
Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
         It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry 
         conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-
         powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
         a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to
         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason
         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an
         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one 
         side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""
         steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
         energy that carnot will give them.
         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
         The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,
         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in
         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
         radioactive pollution of the environment !
         
   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-
         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still
         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with
         the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the
         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
         This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures
         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. 

   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem
         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
         1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
         getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.
         

Only my 0.02$ !

No, it is independent of the speedometer. The gun processes two doppler
returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
of the target, taking the difference between the two. Some guns with
a ""moving mode"" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
preferentially at the pavement.

Car and Driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in
1985. I used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
radar-measured ticket. It detailed ""moving mode,"" which is easier to
defend against because of the increased amount of variables.

To put it bluntly, they are full of it.

Paying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the 
output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to 
this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision 
copy protection.)

In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry 
of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow 
magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The 
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.

It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.
When the SYSOP wanted to, he could have a message sent to the user's end 
saying that it is sending the code to format your HD.)

Zilog SCC:
---------
	RR0[7]:  Break Detect

This is a very popular part, but it has a number of quirks, especially
in HDLC mode.

Signetics 68562 DUSCC:
---------------------
	RSR[2]:  Break Start Detect
	RSR[3]:  Break End Detect

Two of the bits in the Receiver Status Register.  You can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high, too.  Also, only one NULL will be put
in the FIFO per break detected.

This is simply the best serial chip I've ever worked with.  _Many_ less
quirks than the SCC, which is IMHO second-best.  (Death to 8250 devices!)

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for
antenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations
(though good PC software would also be of interest).
I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for
some time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)
designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption.
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a version
that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm not
sure how many ""new and improved"" versions of the code might be out there
somewhere.
I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones I've seen have
been aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out there
useful at the lower frequencies, I'd like to know about it.

Oh, yeah.  This is a fine place.  We haven't had the ""why does concrete

The concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
them into the ground.

Another explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery
needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery
self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.

Naawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.

I use an H11F1   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals.
There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortion
measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a
+ 14 dB line level.  All I did was put the FET in series with one leg
of the balanced line.  No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence.
The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200
ohms with it on.

 So-Called Cool-Hot boxes have been advetised for several years.  I recall
Damark advertising them in a recent catalog.  Problem with the units is they do
a sh***y job of keeping food cold/warm.  The peliter devices used just don't
seem to have enough punch to keep up.  If you want something hot, you need to
heat it up before you put it in the box, and end up hours later with food thats
only moderately warm.  Same goes for cold items.

What are people's opinions about laser detectors?  Escort makes a
laser detector, the Passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  However,
I've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
detector.  Otherwise it won't work.  Regular radar, of course, travels
in all directions; hence it is more detectable.  Any comments?

Escort has a deal (till the end of April, I think), where if you buy
their wideband (Passport 3200 - X, K, Ka) and laser detectors, you'll
save $60 off of buying them separately.  In this case, the addition of
the laser detector over the Passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. Passport
1000 normally costs $100).

You don't say what kind of ""electronic equipment"" you mean.  It's hard
to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't
do things like washing lubricant out of switches.

When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just
used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear
is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for
several days to be damn sure.

I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.  I would
be very wary of CCl4, not least because it is dangerous to *you* even
if it's not going to harm the equipment -- not only is it poisonous,
but I believe it's now known to be carcinogenic.

Recently I posted two oscilliscopes for sale. One has sold, the other is

 Used, good condition:
 Hitachi V-422 40MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 1mV/div
   o DC offset
   o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified
     waveform)
   o VERT mode trigger
   o TV sync separation circuit
 List price      $910.00 (...and the price Fry's electronics just
                         quoted!) :-(
 Sells for       $699.99 (JDR MicroDevices current price)
                 $745.95 (Products International)
 Your price used $425.00 obo
...I haven't gotten an offer at the asking price, so 'obo' applies...

I also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold:
 JDR 2000 20MHz Dual-Channel Portable Analog Oscilliscope
   o 5mV/div
   o Component Tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils)
   o TV video sync filter
   o z-axis input (intensity modulation)

'Broken' means: The CRT produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does
not correspond to the input signal. My guess is it's repairable but more
than a simple calibration problem...but I honestly have not tried to
calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. It's 'as-is'.
I paid $60 for it in its current state (I bought it thinking I'd repair it,
using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since I've sold the
'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and I'd like to recoup
that amount. As above, I'll accept offers and take the best one.

I'd prefer a local (Bay Area, California) buyer, so (a) I don't have to
ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.

Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:
This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set

120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
                           !

modified set for 2 level brightness:

                string 1
120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
    5w    !      string 2     !
          b   ________________!
120v rtn__!___!

             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.

Only one blinker is used.

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  
Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get
one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.

What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light 
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current 
from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing 
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness. 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires 
in a safe manner!

Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.
The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were
VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest
problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.

In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets
with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you
can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they
were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory
periodically.

With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be
less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer
recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their
equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find
that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it
should be o.k. for most applications.

Sorry, I am way out of line here. My first microcontroller I built was
a MC68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. That was not easy to
work with (in addtion to a small 2K on-board EPROM).

Yes and no. I would use the FM transmitter chip from Motorola (Linear and  
Interface Databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. SBL-1 from  
mini circuits lab). Everything is done in the FM chip and then mixed up with  
the oscillator frequency. Just have a look at the ARRL Handbook. There are lots  
of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. I don't think, there are single  
chip designs for such high frequencies yet.

I am looking for a text/reference that will include pinouts,

Does such a text exist?  Are there docs on the Internet that

IC manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
FTP site with all it's data books in the form of text files.
(ala RFC style).  This would save time and money for the
IC manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
IC's
are found in the internet anyway.  

Are there any books available for purchase that reference

My impression -- it's not an area I've played with much -- is that the
much-beloved NE567 is basically obsolete.  If you want to detect a 1kHz
tone, set a switched-capacitor filter chip to that frequency, feed your
input to it, and see if anything comes out the other end.  The NE567 was
what you used when good clean bandpass filters were hard to do; nowadays
they're easy, and the results are better.

I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet,
I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only
a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters,
resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to
look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one
grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the
presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However,
you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.

The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as
much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets.
Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe
that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).

If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say
fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain
(I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9
months).

PS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill with
the waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought

wonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits)
to refill my cartridge?

Hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  Just
a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  I have the clues

occasionally and I dont know what they do.  I think type D is like a PWM scheme
or something.  Thanx in advanced.

---------->
The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.

Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like
switching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called ""class S""
before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable
for very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile
amp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year
(to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems
with layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able
isolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) ) 

I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that
operates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver
amps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit 
(I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and
I beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that
it had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on
PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)
under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high
current at the zero-voltage crossings).

I don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
postings ""near UV light"" /is/ ""actual UV light.""  The ""near"" means that
it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what
""far UV"" is.)

Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the
near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are
going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV
sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The
shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.

It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively
cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to
be useful, but not dangerously so.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities
to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and
use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software,
_DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551
with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).

Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_
stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may
get only a half byte...

	Nonsense.  First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water
(that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes

The simplest one is easy.  Take a lemon or other citrus type fruit, and
stick a pair of metal strips into it for the contacts.  The two strips must
be of disimelar metals like copper and zinc.  Then connect a voltmeter to
the contacts and read the voltage.

Not recommended. Your circuit would take too much current, when
telephone is on-hook. Telephone company does not like it.

I'm doing some work on the Mac IIsi and need some information on the CPU.
I have the Motorola MC68030UM/AD Rev. 1, but I fear it is out of date as it
does not have the characteristics for the CPU package type used in the IIsi.

What I need is the Theta (JC) Thermal Characteristic (the Junction to Case
thermal resistance) for the _PLASTIC_ FE style package.

If you have this info, I would appreciate your sending it by email as postings
suffer a few days delay here.

If you are keen on this stuff, I am also interested in a more accurate value
for the typical power dissipation. I'm assuming 2.25 Watts (using the 2.6 W
maximum at 0 C decreased the way the Pd drops in the 6801x as Ta increases).
If your manual has a chart of power dissipation, I'd like to know what it
reads at 25 C and 40 C.

Thanks for reading!

Heh, heh, heh, heh....I laugh because I have the same damn TV, and it
did the same thing!  Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the
same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.

#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want
to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll 
*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any
case, don't kick it around! :-) 

#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned
out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess
the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying
around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it
being more than 50 cents!.

Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of
schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
the flyback.

Yes, it does.
All the equipment has to have that Telekom approval number to be
legal.
What has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else.
I'm pretty sure the same holds true in Sweden (at least when I read

Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in
a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this
concept.

What is the difference between vertical and horizontal?

This depends on the required range, the required accuracy, the allowable
ambiguity in range, the frequencies the FCC (etc) allow you to use.

They do interpolate - it's not linear interpolation though. You are correct
that the frequency content is not altered (more specifically, the baseband
spectrum is preserved, and so is every Nth image spectrum. The other
(N-1) in N image spectra are removed, where N is the oversampling rate)

Ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0Hz to 22050Hz, and a gain of 0
from 22050 to the new Nyquist frequency. In practice a finite transition
band is required, and there is also a certain amount of pass-band ripple
and stop-band leakage. With a high order (eg 200 taps) digital filter,
a very good approximation can be easily achieved.

No, they actually use a digital FIR just like yours, but built in hardware,

I guess that the answer is somewhere between the two.

As an interesting (?) aside, some of you out there may be aware of a scheme
used by Pioneer and Wadia, which is called (by Pioneer, at least) Legato
Link. I haven't heard one of these players, but by reading advertising
blurb, and a couple of pseudo-technical articles I deduced that all they
do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter, and let a load of the
first image (ie aliassed) spectrum through. Talking to Bob Stuart (of
Boothroyd Stuart, aka Meridian) confirmed my suspicion. He said that it
sounded awful, but then he would, wouldn't he...

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.

The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,
translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this
does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying
their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But
it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that
the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own
diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.

Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning
that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for
him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone
else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is
not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages
a court would award.

However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,
almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore
unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)
cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.

Caution:  I am not a lawyer.  Consulting a professional would be wise if
significant amounts of money are at stake.

When constructing active filters,  odd values of resistor are often required 
(i.e. something like a 3.14 K Ohm resistor).(It seems best to choose common 
capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).

Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade?.(1,
1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc ).  It is a common enough problem,  yet I cant

Might depend on where you live .. I know locally, for most of the winter
the ground, and concrete floor, within sheds and garages (unheated) is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature.  The air does get
warmer during the day, but during the night, the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer, especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect.  And the nights are longer by several hours than the
days.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not
	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't
	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,
	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;
	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.

	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National
	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).
	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,
	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!

	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the
	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,
	however, do not.  Check your with your local building
	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family
	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial
	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different
	rules.

	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in
	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.
	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line
	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've
	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or
	``CEC''.

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.

Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.
	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly
	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the
	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged
	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.
	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized
	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the
	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --
	US$65 plus shipping and handling.

Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance
	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two
	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,
	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the
	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th
	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th
	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an
	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In
	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications.

	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province.

Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?

	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.
	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical
	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)
	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However,
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can
	find one willing to supervise.

	If you do your own wiring, an important point:

	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,
	and will impress the inspector.

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to
	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.
	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.

	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector
	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it
	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way.

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C
	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types
	become very brittle.

Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?

	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few
	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved
	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers
	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.

	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or
	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or
	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill
	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and
	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull
	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.

	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws
	work well).
	
	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper,
	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay
	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized
	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should
	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There
	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't
	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.

	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire
	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more
	accurate.

	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the
	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)
	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors.

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation.

	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired
	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more
	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple
	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost
	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.

	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)
	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)

	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.
	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.

	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate).

Subject: What is UL listing?

	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent
	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means
	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements
	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just
	that it probably won't kill you.

	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are
	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.
	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or
	occupancy permits issued.
	
Subject: What is CSA approval?

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to
	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is
	required by law.

	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved
	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim.

	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC
	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies.

Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?

	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell,
	    Craftsman Books,
	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70
	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan
	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co.
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision.  Which is currently 1990.

	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called
	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer
	questions on the net ;-).

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.

Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about
	this.

	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at
	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims.

	In general, the process goes like this:
		- you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose
		  special conditions on you, require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.
		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection.
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors.
		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before
		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a
		  ""rough-in"" inspection.
		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,
		  you will need a ""final inspection"".

Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.
	Do I have to upgrade?

	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,
	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some
	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.

Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V
	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same
	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.
	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number
	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and
	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V
	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low.

	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y""
	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...

Subject: What does an electrical service look like?

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)).
	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire
	normally carries no current.

	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or
	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.
	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the
	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often
	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.

	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in
	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.
	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral
	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.

	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are
	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one
	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 
	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your
	inspector.

	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot""
	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well.

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,
	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one
	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some
	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only
	service).

Subject: What is a circuit?

	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:
		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.
		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.
		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,
		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.

	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or
	air conditioners.

	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there
	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead
	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.
	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,
	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to
	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible.]

	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,
	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.

	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a
	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.

	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground
	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape.

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.

	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)
	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"",
	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection.

Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the
	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green
	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the
	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding
	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should
	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire
	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected
	together in the panel.

	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]

	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used
	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to
	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral""
	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light
	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.

Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For
	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should
	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As
	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire.

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively
	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use
	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a
	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be
	replaced.

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact.  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high
	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which
	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose.

	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which
	can often cause severe damage.

Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse
	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a
	penny"" trick.

	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better
	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When
	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,
	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.
	Breakers don't do this.

	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special
	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)

	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the
	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one.

Subject: What size wire should I use?

	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,
	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,
	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid
	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.

	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily:

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type.

Subject: Where do these numbers come from?

	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.
	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When
	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need
	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in
	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs.

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.
	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller
	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire.

Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means
	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.

	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In
	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.

	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.

Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they
	used?

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector""
	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.

	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them
	together, then twist the wirenut on.

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure.

	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers,
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly.

	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead
	of taping it, the connection should be redone.

Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?

	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any
	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking
	the circuit.

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,
	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI
	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the
	GFCI happy.

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.
	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed
	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be
	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet.

Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,
	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',
	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances.

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or
	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may
	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?

Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a
	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,
	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most
	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.

Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?

	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with
	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE
	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one
	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch
	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),
	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a
	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on
	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such
	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.

	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use
	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.

	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.

	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little
	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which
	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead.

Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?

	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,
	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if
	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of
	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very
	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).

	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In
	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will
	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;
	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were
	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to
	ground...

Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization

	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the
	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)
	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the
	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).

	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the
	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.
	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to.

Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex
	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider
	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,
	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be
	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When
	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be
	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets.

Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to
	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.

Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.
	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.
	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside
	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several
	different categories of NM cable.

	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage.

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath.
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC)
	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.

	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,
	but this is technically illegal.]

	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the
	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC
	and CEC):

	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.
	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.
	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance.
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.
	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation
	      material (a wad of fiberglass).
	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box
	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"".
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,
	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical]
	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.
	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring
	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach...]
	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or
	      similar finish.
	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.
	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m (39"").

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation.

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings.

	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of
	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a
	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the
	wire.

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.

	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will
	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like
	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground
	wiring section.]

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose.

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"".
	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.

	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes
	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.
	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable
	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.

	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other
	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For
	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.

Subject: Junction box positioning?

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may
	get nasty.

Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?

	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few
	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well.  For example, older house
	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess
	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists.

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually
	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering
	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*
	long)

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3""
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,
	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.
	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown
	in later.]

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat
	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.
	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary.

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.

Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with
	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can
	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in
	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral).

	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem.

	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.

Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?

	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque,
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.

	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between
	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the
	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a
	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if
	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to
	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must.

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.

Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?

	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor
	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long.

Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200
	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational
	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.

	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router
	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall
	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously.

	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This
	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,
	check the amperage rating, which is always present.

Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?

	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety
	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.

	There are several different approaches to solving this:
	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.
	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.
	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.
	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong
	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,
	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable.

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.
	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.

Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?
	Should the test button work?

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,
	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.
	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require
	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:
	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially
	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded
	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician
	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it, and promised to investigate.)

Subject: How should I wire my shop?

	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for
	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have
	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp
	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two
	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.

	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and
	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong.

	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring""
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V
	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.
	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,
	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop
	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to
	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.
	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''
	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.
	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy
	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.

	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And
	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea.

	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.

Subject: Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use
	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is
	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,
	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And
	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation.

	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power
	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.

Subject: Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.
	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new
	wiring.

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum
	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.
	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper
	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When
	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes
	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance
	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/
	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even
	cause a fire.

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things:

	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will
	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes
	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.

	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be
	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection.

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.

	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.
	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately.

	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,
	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should
	       be repaired.
	    
	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an
	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool.

	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above.
	    
	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped
	       (not nicked) wire etc.
    
	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,
	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,
	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having
	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.
	You can do this yourself too.

Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?

	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.
	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any
	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many
	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.

	Here's some hints on what to look for:

	Obvious non-code wiring can include:

		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls
		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without
		  proper marking.
		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of
		  a GFCI)
		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)
		- Switched neutrals
		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one
	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:

		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring)
		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when
		  it's *really* convenient ;-)
		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		- Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different
	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 
	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural
	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping
	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture.
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some
	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires.

	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.

	Comments on K&T:

		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.
		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in
		  quite good condition.
		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.
		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with
		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.
		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit.
		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain K&T.
		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be
		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.
		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.
	
	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques.
	
	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was
	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.
	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.

	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink
	tubing.

	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be
	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff -
	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.

Subject: Where do I buy stuff?

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety
	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from
various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]

The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course),
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data.
Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points
between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more
complicated.

Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective""
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of
all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias
filtering.

Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW
PeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls
the rig an ""electronic brake"" since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down.

My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's
astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with
the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the 
distributor pickup.  Very poor design.

I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing
to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is
wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting
out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference
between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are
usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation
when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when
you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details
and addresses).

Good advice.  Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use
a ""handle.""  They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well,
but that's not to say that they don't from time to time.

Are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost
recovery on?  I may be interested.  I think for practical and cost reasons I
am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the
output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to
extend range.

Yes I'm interested in the company name.  I have access to an extensive data

eye safety is getting to be a problem.

I'm keeping my application confidential for now.  Raising the frequency should
be no problem, in fact one respondent to my question said that I may not have
to mimic the 50% duty cycle normally used by IR detector chips.

   How much software is out there for the Mac?  I've been interested
in using microcontrollers in imbedded applications for a long time,
but was always under the impression that I would need an IBM to run
the debug/compile/etc software.
   I would like to use a 6811 or 6816.  I'm proficient in 6800 assembly,
but have never NEEDED it except some toying with old 6802EVBs.

   Motorola doesn't seem to have any information on Mac software (at
least their local distributor doesn't) and the ELE department around
here has been of little help as well.
   I hope someone can tell me that I don't have to buy an IBM to 
work with the 6811 or 6816 Evaluation Boards...please send me mail!

How do you spell ""tuna helper"" ? 

I gather by off-shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
blue-fin tuna's who are into that squid-fi sound?  (I agree on that one). 
My Adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
""running the chips class ""A"" resistor mod"", and replacing the metal 
bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound 
better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority 
with Adcom, else the mods would neither have been necessary, nor would they 
have improved what was already touted as superlative state-o-d-art le'sound. 
I really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
from an sp9II (even an sp3a!) to a GFP-555/etc., or maybe from those that 
have dumped their forte' amps for a GFA-555/etc....

The lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following
chemical reaction:
 
Pb + PbO2 + 2H2SO4 --> 2PbSO4 + 2H20
 
Lead and Lead (IV) Oxide and Sulfuric Acid produce Lead Sulfate and Water
 
The standard heats of formation at 25 C (77 F) of the various compounds are:
 
              Heat of formation
Compound      at 25 C, kcal/mole
--------      ------------------
   Pb               0.00
  PbO2            -65.0
 H2SO4           -193.69
 PbSO4           -218.5
  H20             -68.3174
 
The heat of reaction at 25 C is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole PbSO4 produced.
Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water
at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be
wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel
like thinking through it right now.)
 
What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,
is exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes
(acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals
may form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.
The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery
charger) is put back into the battery.
 
Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each
cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts
(terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric
energy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it
has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So
while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.
 
To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's
Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials:
 
                                              thermal conductivity

         (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44
pine (across grain)             15                   0.087

oak (across grain)              15                   0.12
maple (across grain)            50                   0.11
 
Note that the thermal conductivity for ""dirt"" (diatomaceous earth) goes down
with temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder
are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity
of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4
times greater than wood.
 
It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on
concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the
discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity
or heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).)
During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on
the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity
surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity
surface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom
surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,
the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster
than that on dirt.
 
This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which
""pulls"" the reaction along.
 
Also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric
acid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.

If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be
there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The
regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits
shut down the EHT supply section.

Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower
the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set
operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.

There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one
above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler
module may be shot; that's fairly common.

people responded with good information, but I don't think I communicated 
exactly what I am looking for.
	I'm working on a custom I/O device that will communicate with a host
via RS-232.  My custom circuitry will use an 80C186EB or EC CPU and require
about 64K of RAM (preferably FLASH RAM).  In looking around, I see that lots
of people have engineered UART-CPU-ROM-RAM subsystems that are ready to be
interfaced to your custom I/O devices.  It's been done so much, that it 
would be best if I can avoid reinventing a system.  It just needs to use
an 80C186 (or 188) CPU, and be able to load a program from the host then 
transfer control to that program.  Well, there's one other thing the ROM
needs to know how to do.  It should have routines to send and receive bytes
to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (DTR,RTS,DTS,CTS).
Everything I've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  That's too much for
this application.  I need something around $100.00.  The CPU has the UART
built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  Does anyone know a 
company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain

At 50 miles, a conventional set of TV antennas on a pole (one aimed

Gadgets to plug into your house wiring are even worse.

Sorry Geoff,

Agree solder mask is green, but in the old days we didn't have wave soldering
machines (which are another topic again).  I had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning!

Board under the mask was the original query.

BTW cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are done
with brown pheonolic boards.  Is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools.  Workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home.  They are very obviously hand soldered.  Quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into Canada from Red China.  In China there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it's yours.  One of my
co-workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 50%.

Also, the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press.  An old lithographer friend had a press for this.  After the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking 
method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer
in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with 
pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite
zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes
away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional 
to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body.
This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.

Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their 
bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.

The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the
Amiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera 
trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of
view, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events
can be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been
fun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy.
Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances,
you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights,
and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and
video brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything
particularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes...

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in
any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference
power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.
So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation
such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.

For power:

  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )

For amplitude

  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )

'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.
It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for
the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation
convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.

Common references for audio are:

	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
	0 dBV = 1 volt

	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)
	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)


Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
or moment.

Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done
with the above two identities and ohm's law.

Ok, here could be the first question or answer or something:

Q: I want to copyprotect a program I wrote.  How should I do it?
A: You would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  You see, those 
   people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to 
   various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers 
   are good, and know the common tricks.
   So, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.
   Ok, then.  What about legitimate users?  Copy protection can be a hassle
   for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially
   if there is some ""key"" item that can get lost.
   So, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but
   would make life somewhat of a misery for them.



(This is my opinion, and I speak as a legitimate user :-)
You are of course free to have your opinion about this subject....

Uh, Bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature?  On the time
scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings
several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature
difference between the battery and what it's sitting on.

>... Question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
>surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?

Because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is
determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
heat loss.  You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case
of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will
affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if
it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final
temperature.

For the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not
whether water will freeze.

Here in Erie, PA there is a system in the inner city called Rado-Lite (a 
trade name) which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of 
way by controlling traffic lights through RADIO signals.  The receivers 
look much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less
than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that 
an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching.  Local folklore 
says this system was invented here; I don't know if this company has any 
other installations.  It has been in operation for at least 30 years, going 
only by my memory.

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a ""character"" containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This
means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to
detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal
generated by UARTs, etc.

I have always thought that if I wanted to send the Police a tape with

tape would be erased as it was played. Who would think to check?

I have written a program and I want to market it.  I would like certain degree
of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
cooperations.   I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,
however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that.
Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of my
software. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.

However, I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software.  
Off course, I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they
can develope a better program anyway.

Might be a good idea...  The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV
In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than
that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
inside a PC.

Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low
distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital
Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized
waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on
the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.
(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed
- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)

If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at
the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete
sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it
uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated
from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design
guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db
max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces

A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a
call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000
for application assistance.

This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.
(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)

>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC-
>based ADC system.

I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be
throwing out your money.

LATCH STROBE INPUT, pin 5, when low, the data in the latches follow the data on the latch data
                             inputs.  When high, the data in the latches will not change.  If the

                               the previous character will again be displayed.

BLANKING INPUT, pin 8,    When high, the display is blanked regardless of the levels of the other
                              inputs.  When low, a character is displayed as determined by the data

LATCH DATA INPUTS, pins 2,3,12,13,   Data on these inputs are entered into the latches when the enable
                                          input is low.  The binary weights of these inputs are A = 1,

LED SUPPLY, pin 1            This connection permits the user to save on regulated Vcc current by using
                                 a separate LED supply, or it may be externally connected to the logic

Recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound.
I didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated HV at work, nor are the
filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.

On examining the power board, I noticed the largest capacitor with a very
bad bulge at the top.  Naturally, I want to replace it, but I can't find
any sources.

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is
roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8"" wide.  The dimensions are important since
the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

Living in the Los Angeles area, I've been to numerous stores (Dow Radio,
All Electronics, ITC Elect, Sandy's, Yale Elect) with empty hands.

Can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  Mail order is 
fine, although I'd rather check out a store to compare the can.  I'm going
to try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have HV caps.

(By the way, the monitor is a ATARI SC1224, Goldstar circuitry, Masushita
tube.  Anyone else had problems?)

Thanks in advance,

You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!
So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.

As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most
notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,
rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup
in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.

GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
regularly (using the test button).

Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, I
have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
their common sense list.  Please exercise caution.

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking
about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).

If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires
unless there is a fault condition.  Notice also that in the breaker box
there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.

Just MHO, but I prefer hardcopy books because you can have three or four  
of them open spread across the bed (next to the desk in my dorm) and  
reference them while using the program full-screen.  The Windows Help  
things come closest to good on-line documentation I've seen, but they  
generally aren't detailed enough and would probably take a LARGE amount of  
space (even compressed) which is at a premium on my system . . ..  In  
fact, the manuals are the primary reason I bought Borland's C++ compiler  
instead of using the one the lab licensed (in the lab, of course).  I've  
got a SHELF full of books to help me out when I'm stuck.  :-)   To each  
his own . . . :-)

We've destroyed about six sets of original Microsoft Word for Mac 5.0 and  
Word for Windows (may have been a bad batch of disks).  Don't have the  
faintest idea what happened to them, they just went bad.  Weren't stored  
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated, indeed they were only  
used once.  Given this, and the massive headaches finding a working set of  
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down, I'd say  
having working backups is a godsend.  I sure wish we'd had them (Sometimes  
I think Murphy's Law holds true more often than Newton's!!) when we needed  
them.  I think it's sortof like snake antivenin.  99.995% of the time you  
have absolutely no use for it, but when you need it, BOY do you ever need  
it!

I don't have backups of my originals at ""home"" but then my machine doesn't  
see anywhere NEAR the use/abuse of these here at the lab, and so I  
consider it less of a risk.  Still, I usually make ""working copies"" of  
them when I install them and then eventually re-use these ""working copies""  
for something else. . ..

Just mine, too!  :-)

BTW, before anyone notices my mentioning ""copying"" programs from machine  
to machine when we do installs here and wonders about the licensing, the  
upper-management (non-student staff, of course) are METICULOUS in checking  
with providers of the software and making SURE we are sticking to the  
license agreements . . ..

From what I understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
device much like the radio in your car.  They work as an antenna picking
up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  Therefore there would
be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.

The ground-lift switch disconnects the GND line from the mixer. The

Some phones have a little switch inside, so you are able to use them

Several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in
defiance to Virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out
thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
the Virginia State lines.  At that time there were no radar
detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would
imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!

As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law
against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective
Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector
accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.  

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2

What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about
dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
control as the best method for controlling brightness.
  I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing
filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had
heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by
cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's
power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then

Actually, a lot of this work used to be done with a CRT that had a beamsplitter
mounted in front, and a tachistoscope driving it.  The tachistoscope is really
just a slide projector with a very fast shutter.  Low tech, but it does the job.

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered
for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.

Also, I know for sure that the IBM Technical Reference says the following
about the Monochrome Display & Printer Adapter and the IBM Parallel Printer
Adapter:

    It is essential that the external device not try to pull these
    lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.

And later:

    If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in
    violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this
    data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.

I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
as a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think
you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the
data lines, while an external device drives them.''  The input
data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.

Anyone claiming that 1500 ""real watts"" isn't possible in a mobile should
dig through their back issues of 73 (and, I think, QST) for a description
of the mobile installation of that most revered of OMs, W6AM.  As I recall,
this included a Heath 1kW (DC in) amp (what was that model number...SB-
something....  my mind is turning to the usual Friday mush...) and was run 
full-out CW fairly regulary.  The car's electrical system had been modified, 
including a rather seriously-heavy-duty alternator, but such an installation 
HAS been done, and so IS possible.  This installation was the source of
the legendary story of W6AM sitting in the car, and paging his wife over the
department store PA systems!

You are correct; the fastest ""complete"" image that could be presented on
TV would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  Of course,
the phrase ""TV screen"" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT
display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.  Might

Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle
it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  The chemical is called
d-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract
of some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a
general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --
it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  It works on sticker glue, crayons,
grease, oil, etc.

It's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add
water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.

Hi,
	I am looking for some help in choosing a package
for a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently being 
fabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to test
the chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100
packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speed
testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
 	
	I know for sure that a DIP will not work
(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
I am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
leadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hard
to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
setup and I would spend loads of time soldering 
as I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chip
carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
not work at high speeds.
 
	Does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
of this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/

would help. 
 
P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bit

In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than 
you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
printer)

A sage said to me: ""Do you want one copy or lots of copies?"", ""One"", 
""Inkjet"".

Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter 
will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.

HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
software package has no inkjet driver. 

There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a 
laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers 
actually use this facility.
(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.
Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.

The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the
grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from
each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect
the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.

Bob is indeed correct here in more than one way. A look in the old
RCA picture tube manual backs this up, as does SAMS Reference Data
handbook. The internal coating around the perimeter of the CRT
(not the aluminum or tin CRT face coating) is referred to as a
""dag"" as well as the outer coating.

Thankfully, I didn't need to go to a f****** library to find it, either.

    Pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
(octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-20kHz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the 10Hz-20Hz octave.
    White noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
(Hz, kHz, etc).  Thus the 10kHz-10.1kHz band has the same amount of
noise power as the 10Hz-110Hz band (both bands are 100Hz wide).
    Pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave
filter (usually approximated by a network of several RC pairs).
Note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network 
:-(
    Pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.
It shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)
as a flat line across the bands.

opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.

Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip
micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only
costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed
the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell,
use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely
on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want
to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut
you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.

If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of 
maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET
to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than 
you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add
a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count
screams up to 9.

PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This
application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the 
programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

Just a thought........Maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
IS an Emerson.  I've got an Emerson VCR which is #6 in the series.  Returned
it six times for various and never the same problems.  Got tired of taking it 
back and fixed it myself.  The Hi-Fi ""window"" was a bit off.  Something like
the Hi-Fi audio fine-tuning.  When I was a Wal-Mart ""associate"" in '88-'89,
we had AT LEAST one returned as defective EVERY SINGLE DAY.  How's that for
reliability?  Face it--Emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium
quality), but they CAN'T make anything as complex as video equipment with 
reliability IMHO.  Please, no flames.  Just *had* to share my Emerson disaster
in the light of this exploding tv.

Subject: Re: Pinout needed for TIL311
Organization: Humber College Technology Dept.
Lines: 29

 According to my TI databook, the pinouts for the TIL311 display are as
follows:
 
 Pin 1 - LED supply voltage
 Pin 2 - Latch data input B
 Pin 3 - Latch data input A
 Pin 4 - Left decimal point cathode
 Pin 5 - Latch strobe input
 Pin 6 - Omitted
 Pin 7 - Common ground
 Pin 8 - Blanking input
 Pin 9 - Omitted 
 Pin 10 - Right decimal point cathode
 Pin 11 - Omitted
 Pin 12 - Latch data input D
 Pin 13 - Latch data input C
 Pin 14 - Logic supply voltage, Vcc
 
The logic supply voltage is 5V @ 60-90mA. The LED supply is also 5V, but
it need not be particularly well regulated. The LED drivers on the chip
use a constant current source, so LED intensity is not affected by the
supply voltage.

One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG
channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.
If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be
sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per
channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should
be rather easy to accomplish.

Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without
generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is
in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
keep balanced.

A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
govern the use of transeivers in your location.

I have a project in mind that requires an array of LEDs that can be addressed
individually by a microprocessor (say, 16x16 or so).  Is there an LSI that
is designed to drive an LED array (including RAM to hold the array state),
or failing that, some way of multiplexing the display so I don't have to
latch a bit for each LED using a discrete latch?  (I want to avoid having
a huge board covered with 373s if possible!)  Thanks in advance...

	Just thought I would add $0.02 to DeskJet thread. I got my
first one in college about 5 or so years ago.

	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for
past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I
got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister
and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go
for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's).
The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would
say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one
(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.

	My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it
to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief
advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:

Advantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's
printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't,
so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet
AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one
DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to
color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I
received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp
laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those
ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25
per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all
hours of the night....)

Disadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and
wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink
(I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and
running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your
bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts
(I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to
$12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but
I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of
about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after
fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing
doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the
paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.
Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in
speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press
software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but
they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.

In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript
(unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even
when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only
instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board
Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser
Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB
negatives directly onto a transparency.

Well, hope my babbling has helped.

I have the ARRL Handbook for the Radio AMateur, and I'm getting the
Solid STate Design for the Radio Amateur.

The handbook is $25 and Solid State is $12 from ARRL, 225 Main, Newington,
CT 06111 but you should be able to find them at electronics or amateur radio
stores.
ARRL will want $5 or so for shipping.

  Does anyone have some information on the relative fraction of the final
cost of each component in an average hard drive?  For instance, I'm pretty
sure the heads and the platters are the most expensive parts, with the
assembly costs running a close third.  Cost of the electronics is likely
in the noise.
  Any hard numbers ($$ or percentage)?  Thanks.

Not any more.  About 2 years ago they all closed.
When Ramco/Electronics city closed, it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out (so I heard).
There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires,
but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff.

Sylvan/Wellington is still on Broadway and Canal, but they're
not cheap, and not surplus.  It's mostly a TV repairman's store.

Not in isolated ground recepticles (usually an unusual color, such as orange
or yellow) often used in low noise, low leakage applications, as mentioned
earlier in the thread.
