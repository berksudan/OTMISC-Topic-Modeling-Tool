I understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered,
so we may learn more during their hearings.

Tough call without more investigation, but if the thermal imaging story
holds up, I think the government will be more credable... of course,
paranoia fans won't believe their results anyway, will they?

Hear, hear! I'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head), and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. It is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident, but I tend to believe the government
side.

People are sucking up to the government when they decide that ONLY the
things the government says are plausible.  Especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

However, from what I saw plastered all over the TV news last night, it's
no longer necessary to be an ""independent thinker"" to depart from the
government's party line.  It looks like our ""independent press"" may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  This, to me, is
a good sign.  I hope it continues.

Independent thinkers question authority.  In a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented, ""coming to a conclusion"" is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
to challenge those ""facts"" critically.  The scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

Has anyone publically considered the possibility that the fires were set
for defence instead of suicide and the destruction and confusion caused
by the tanks and gas caused things to get out of the BDs control?

Well, I didn't bother writing to Boxer, Feinstein or Eshoo, the terrible

was not exactly strongly-worded; I simply stated that the BATF approach
was immoral (military-style assault, firing into a house where they knew
there were kids).

Aparently, Bentsen forwarded my letter to the BATF and they responded to 
me directly.  It follows the text of your reply pretty closely.  However,
I intend to send another letter directly to them, in return.

The FBI, CIA, BATF, etc. ARE federal agencies, you are correct.  But to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and
that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then
tell the Prez, who says, ""I knew all along"".  While this may not seem right,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after
all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and
maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses
are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority
religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do
not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are
associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about
would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt
BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President
Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.

	No chance.  If that CS ignited at all, it would have been
quite similar to a grain bin explosion.  Explosion, I note.  The
entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.  As
there was no explosion, there was no CS ignition causing the fire.

	Note: at five miles a decent grain elevator explosion will
knock you on your butt and your ears will ring for days.  I speak
from experience here.

	And our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  A
fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We
all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
firearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to
do it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with
a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many?  We say ""no,"" while others say ""yes.""

	Of course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention
is how much one has to pay.

>MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE

	It is this ""giving a little"" that makes Americans wary...
We have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a
Chamberlain ""gave a little"" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
and how such ""appeasement"" worked.  While it might work in some
instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a
history of failure.

	Cars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in
the USA.  I'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,
cars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the
arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns.  How one defines ""essential"" often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we
look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.

>EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
>more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!

	This depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As
Desert Storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
when given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
Thus, we're left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown
or if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.
One can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.

>Is this discussion about

	It is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have

>Change of name.......

	That was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out
how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different

how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.

	BATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child
abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.

because of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.

To Rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.
   The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the 
building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed
with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit 
for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims 
that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped
into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either
bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.
I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS
gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY 
uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in 
the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less 
eat.  So my question now is ""why were they cooking food?""
   I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.
But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more
crazy than the ATF/FBI claim).

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their ""OWN CHOICE"".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they ""stockpiled weapons"".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some ""gun parts"" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you 
think?

There is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  The Senate,
unfortunately, is a different story.  The Lt.Gov. has vowed that the bill will
not be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  In addition, the Senate is a
much smaller, and more readily manipulated body.

On ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least
fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is VERY far down in
the bill order in the Senate (I believe it will be addressed after the CCW
bill).

And I thought my TX Political Science class was a waste of time!

The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance to

Moreover, the BATF has admitted having agents in the compound, and as
far as I have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the
compound when the first shots were fired.  For all we know, these two
people may BE the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
and ""cook"" with the faithful...

Assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.

Maybe I sound paranoid, but I watched Janet Reno last night harping on
how much David Koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and I kept wondering 
why she -- much less BATF -- wanted us to infer that she had any 
jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.

I'm POSITIVE that the ""sealed warrant"" is not for child abuse.  What was
it for?  Peobably weapons violations.  Janet Reno didn't say WORD ONE
last night about weapons violations.  Why?  Because she knows that such
a case is no longer believable?

surrounding you?  In other words, is it possible that the prolonged gassing
disoriented the wackos enough that possibility of escape was rendered
questionable?

        The voting booth is highly over-rated.  People need to get up

most don't even do that.

        No, because ""we"" have decided that it doesn't make enough
difference to ""us"" to get up and do something.  That's something,
for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government.  Dozens of ""pro-gun"" speakers
show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.
 
        Why?  Because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters
who's willing to scream afterwards.  And it isn't that most people
give a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  Nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

       The general public's usually not even read the constitution.
And what they have learned is a distorted picture of the whole thing.

I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
""assault weapon"".  You are wrong.  Compared to what most criminals use, a
9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely
rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with
""civie"" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and
the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.

What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen
alone?  It hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work.

       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are
verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments
abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused

       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  

       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust
the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies
total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.

       This is very likely.

       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many
people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're
here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should
have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.
Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more
magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.

>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!

       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,
two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide
rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about
half the per-car death rate.

      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The
fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent.

      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.

      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even
if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.

>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
>it's the 'axer' ??
>(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)


       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.
(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per 
se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's
countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got
more knives or fists.  

       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.
have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they
are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is 
violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The
*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of
99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that
you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.

>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? 

       The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives.
But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,
protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,
too, lost their livelihoods?

>Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.
However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can
be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.

       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If
you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully
simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,
as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)

>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.
That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.
Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the
group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.

       You may take that for what it's worth.

I don't sign any blank checks.

When Doug Foxvog says ""weapons of mass destruction,"" he means CBW and
nukes.  When Sarah Brady says ""weapons of mass destruction"" she means
Street Sweeper shotguns and semi-automatic SKS rifles.  When John
Lawrence Rutledge says ""weapons of mass destruction,"" and then immediately
follows it with:

Folks,

It's time to start building some precise questions to send to our
federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our
local TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be
asked at any investigation into the BATF's and FBI's participation
at the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
from the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
at my gut.  The list will probably grow. 

1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that
     the BATF obtained?

2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition
     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a ""no-knock""
     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the 
     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without 
     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
     on the door of the Branch Davidian's complex and serve the warrant 
     in a manner prescribed by law?

3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents
     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building
     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.
     Knowing children were present, why didn't the BATF have an
     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 

4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over
     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the
     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms
     License, were they actively participating in the legal business
     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the
     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence
     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
     dispossessed weapons.

5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,
     a BATF spokeswoman stated ""We were outgunned!"".  Yet, TV newscasts
     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents
     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the
     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's
     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)
     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the 
     scene of the original assault on the complex?

6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a ""hostage""
     situation? 

7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use ""psychological warfare""
     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and
     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?

8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable
     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers
     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?

9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch
     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members
     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident 
     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  
     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
     penetrated?

10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and
     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,
     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any
     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI
     have that a mass suicide pact existed?

11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian's ammunition
     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be
     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence 
     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition 
     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,
     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were 
     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the
     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
     for someone engaged in such a legal business?

12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical
     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
     crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  Is 
     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will 
     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?

13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the
     complex, ""over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.""  On the video
     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no 
     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,
     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be 
     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  
     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, 
     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do 
     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
     shots from high-power rifles?

14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United
     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use
     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use
     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally
     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?

15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county
     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within
     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?

So if it turns out that the fire WAS caused by a tank knocking over a

Note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.  (Look after the
word ""except"".)  It always helps to read the law before commenting on
it.

Would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  How about someone at
home?  Note that both are legal, and a lot of ""common"" people qualify
for one or the other.

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists
that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.

Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.

The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large
negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
described circumstance) is near zero.

>I can find the figures if you don't believe me.

Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported.  (""Gun cleaning
accident"" is police-speak for ""the family needs the insurance
money."")

A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:

1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation
   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult
   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit
   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,
   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule
   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is
   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.

2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were
   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When
   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault
   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were
   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew
   you could!

3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,
   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and
   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm
   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not
   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up
   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's
   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by
   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I
   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI
   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say
   uncomplimentary.

4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that
   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the
   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing
   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references
   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around
   the ""He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!""
   flag.  Sigh.

5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege
   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought
   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button
   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My
   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to
   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to
   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in
   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the
   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In
   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones
   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:
   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and
   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the
   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have
   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it
   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's
   paranoid delusions.

pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization

about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the

Then you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a
CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that
something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern
capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then
I've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but
don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the

  There was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that I
saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  It doesn't explode on contact with
air.  It is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  Far more
likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with NG outlets running to
the tank.  Damage from the CEV's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing
the gas to spread, unnoticed in the CS fumes and general excitement (propane
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell
leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then Whooosh!  Fire everywhere,
and maybe an explosion.  Use of NG is pretty common in Texas, especially
semi-rural areas.

  I think it would have disarmed many people if the FBI followed this same
policy.  They have not.  They are making claims without evidence, and what
evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.

What is ""doing it right the first time""?  Murdered them all?  Used tanks? 
Maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  From the list presented
to date, I haven't seen ANYTHING illegal.  They claim that the BD's bought
components to convert their weapons to Class III devices, but no evidence that
they had done so.  In fact, with a Class III FFL living with them, this may
have been legal (given recent court rulings).

What you really meant to say was that the ATF should have done the right and
lwaful thing.  Or did you just want the BD's dead?

Subject: Don Kates' talk on the Branch Davidians
Organization: Ideology Busters, Inc.
Keywords: Kates
Lines: 110

This was posted by Lyn Bates to the firearms-politics mailing list:

I recently learned that Don Kates was going to be in Boston to give a talk
at the Harbard Law School about the Waco situation.  (Of course, this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough
summary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

Kates started by saying that since he didn't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not
discuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.

Koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This
isn't the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to
people like Koresh.

Lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.
There were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.
Police originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they
called local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many
small police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the
FBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).
""All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power.""

The BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills
disappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its
existence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
Around the time when the BATF's annual budget is under review, the media
is alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a
pre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but
if any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in
chains.

The Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF's budget was up for
review.

Kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and
that the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

He confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh's arrest
in connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and
the sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns
back.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached
rationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.

The BATF didn't take into account that, unlike most of the FFL's they
audit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his
followers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and
they reacted accordingly.

With respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates
was giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that
the BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their
informants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had
more to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been
completely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you're an officer with a warrant for
thus-and-so; if they don't open the door and the evidence is flushable,
then it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF
breaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the
Davidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served
warrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A
close look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_
have shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was
the first shot fired!

The role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial
position on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the
public's sympathy.

Should the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,
diverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents
like this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,
well-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

PS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston
College Law School next Tuesday, April 27.  I don't know the exact time or
place, but presumably a phone call to the BC law school could elicit that
information.

    He meant the US spends more per capita on guns than Canada which isn't
really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from
the USSR that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending.

    I would like to see if the US spends more per capita on people than 
Canada does.  This is a true apples - apples comparison where the previous
post was apples - oranges.

I read the article as presenting first an argument about weapons of mass
destruction (as commonly understood) and then switching to other topics.
The first point evidently was to show that not all weapons should be
allowed, and then the later analysis was, given this understanding, to
consider another class.

Firearm?  Let's not even consider long knives (swords), which were also
common militia weapons in the 18th century, and which, if anything, are
often restricted more heavily than firearms.  Whatever sense gun control
makes, knife control makes even less.

What if.......

What if the FBI thought that tear gas would force the Davidians out;
at least the mothers and the children, so they (the FBI) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......

What if the FBI knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the FBI knew via their listening devices)

What if the FBI saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......

What if the FBI thought they could finally force the rest of the
Davidians out AND also destroy the evidence that they (the FBI) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......

What if the FBI miscalculated and not many of the rest of the Davidians
made it out.......?????

Answer:  What happened.

I agree, I saw no reason they could not have had ""close in"" pool

No crime, irrelevant either way.

Ah yes, that is exactly what I would do.  Hold Bible study. Take a nap.
Always a wise course of action when you're being gassed.

I don't believe there was a ""suicide pact"".  I believe that Koresh
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
In fact, this hypothesis is CONFIRMED by the survivors' stories.

Yes, that's right.  And once the whole compound was demolished, where
did they expect to go?

The building is being RAMMED and they are going UPSTAIRS?  That's almost
as bad as running into a fire.

Hm, an interesting notion.  We'll see.

Actually, on Friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and

For six hours they were trapped?  The building was not ""destroyed"" 
immediately.  They COULD HAVE LEFT AT ANY TIME.

Six hours to move it away.  Or COME OUT.

No word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative

Right.  For six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at

It's ultimately irrelevant who ""lit"" the fire.  They had ample opportunity

Most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  They tend

I have NEVER judged them by their religion, but by their ACTIONS.

If they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would
have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  Instead, they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least STUPID, if not
IRRATIONAL.  The first was to stockpile weapons.  The second was to
shoot federal agents.  The third was to stay inside.

Just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him, I don't think the FBI deserves blame in this case.

What about guns with non-lethal bullets, like rubber or plastic bullets. Would
those work very well in stopping an attack?

Funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no
evidence ONE WAY or ANOTHER that there were bullet wounds --
not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are
deemed speculative.  INCLUDING reports that there were NO
bullet wounds.

Before long, I think all the kneejerk conspiracy theorists

Lines: 34


The ATF agent interviewed on ""Street Stories"" reported that the raid was
ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was 
coming. WHY?

I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,
and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part
in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even 
suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the
context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, 
as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof
might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests
for sufficient fire power. 

Important dates: 
Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   

On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate
in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have
an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated
agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some
group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent 
on ""Street Stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get 
ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". I believe this attack continued, 
even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top 
down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to
come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.

Well, if police think they are so special that only _THEY_ are worthy
of self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe
we should start demanding that police are only police when ON-DUTY,
that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless
chumps they consider ""civilians.""

Let's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. Or, if they make
the assertion that ""Well, I need to maintain my gun"" let's make it
regulation that they can carry an UNLOADED firearm home, that it's
only fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming home
from his computer operator job...

NRA Director/ex-San Jose cop Leroy Pyle states in the latest SWAT
magazine that anti-cops better watch out for this schism between
RKBA folks and the police. He asks the rhetorical question of 'What
if what's left of the gun lobby starts demanding the disarmament
of the police?""

Well, I guess anti-gun cops who think only they should be armed,
along with the wealthy and politically connected, should be made
to realize that screwing can cut in ways they have yet to imagine.

In the wake of the Waco denouement, I had email discussions with
people from this group.  In particular, we discussed how cults
operate, why the FBI might be motivated to black out news or behave
the way it did, and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing
with cults and similar organizations.

I include an edited account of what I wrote.  The identity of my
correspondents have (I hope) been erased.  The editing process makes

------------------------ (begin included text) -----------------------

I took a course called the MADNESS OF CROWDS, ...  The course included
cults and briefly mentioned/analyzed Jonestown.  (Did some external
reading too).

William Adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of
""evil"" mass movements...  starting with THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,
University of Chicago Press, 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what
would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in WWII,
and by extension in other wars, in racial lynchings ...  I don't think
the books are perfect, and the study of psychopathology has advanced
..., but you can elicit Koresh types from even the first volume.  So I
think they're onto something.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
		How cult psychology works...
	[I'm an amateur.  Hope I'm not hopelessly naive.]

So long as Koresh could ""own"" his people, he made sure they didn't
believe there was any life out there for them, away from him.
Otherwise, he'd (Koresh) be nothing.  During the siege, ex-Davidians
recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived
only through his intercession with God to spare their worthless souls.
Absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ...  As long as they
believed him, they'd ignore BATF/FBI/Child Protective Services or even
the Red Cross asking them to come out.  After all, if they ever left
him, God would catapult them straight to Hell, and the combined forces
of the US gummint, with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)
couldn't save them for a second.  If I believed it, I'd stay and die
too, like the folks in Jonestown.

For a prosaic analogy, replace a cult leader with an estranged wife
(or husband), and notice how many folks show up, kill the ex and then
themselves.  That's the consequence of shattered ""cultism.""  It really
does happen all the time.  [By the way, the treasured ideal in such
cases, without which life is meaningless, is the relationship, no
matter how abusive, rather than the individual's partner.]

...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
    [Why No News, Don't The Feds Owe The World An Explanation?]

I agree that official explanations are in order.  I can also see good
(?)  reasons for news blackouts.

>	The only fact available is that had the FBI not acted  
>	yesterday, those people would be alive today.

 ... that no matter what, those people would have died, because Koresh
made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.
Hence it would make little difference when or how the FBI acted.  He
held them hostage, as his trump against going to jail, but nothing
would really stop him from offing them.  Even if the FBI went away!

Look at history.  Rep Leo Ryan (and some staffers) visited Jonestown,
at the request of constituents who had relatives there.  Once
Jonestown was discovered, and even though they killed Ryan and his
entourage ... they all killed themselves, because Jim Jones knew he'd
be busted.  Internal arguments asking to spare the children, brought
up by some of the women in the cult, were shouted down.  There are
tapes...  The ""logic"" of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is, it
wouldn't kill the kids, was shouted down as blasphemy, and the people
who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by
THEIR OWN AVOWAL would be dead within the hour.  I suspect it's the
same with the Branch Davidians.
(There's a book on Jonestown by James Reston Jr., titled OUR FATHER
WHO ART IN HELL.  I don't know whether it's good - never read it.)

...
The only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment, or organizations buying
full-auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via UPS, on the
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...

So, the only way the BATF/FBI could ""save"" those people, and future
cults, is by ignoring such signs.

I suppose there's another way - outsmarting Koresh and tricking him
into letting them go, or somehow influencing ""his"" people to abandon
him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.
... a mighty tough row to hoe. ...  I suspect the FBI tried to do that
with blackouts, noise and other sensory insults.  However, maybe
they're not very sophisticated, or maybe the job is impossible.  It's
certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.

...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
	[Why the FBI might want to blackout during and coverup after]

    ... - if they were doing a poor job of weaning the BD's from
Koresh, they'd want to keep it quiet so they wouldn't be embarrassed.

    ... - if they were trying to wean the BD's from Koresh, they'd
want to keep it quiet so he couldn't outflank them, or well-meaning
boneheads from ANY point of view wouldn't screw it up. ...  I _hate_
playing chess when the world screams in my face, especially if at
checkmate time people really die, and I could be blamed.

...

I don't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy, unless you
deny the FBI, BATF, Child Protective Services (of whatever stripe) and
the rest of the gummint should exist at all.

Mox nix.  The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light,
and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  That means the
compound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could
be busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can 
tell for sure were all off at the time.

On the contrary.  We are proposing alternate scenarios.  The people who
are coming to wild conclusions are the feds, who are absolutely positive
how the fire started, even though none of them were in a position to 
see it, either (and the stories they ""hear"" from their prisoners changes
hourly).

They did have the proper equipment.  The problem is that they went about
things the wrong way.  The ATF should have served the warrant in a
peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of Rambos with
guns blazing.  I'm not trying to excuse what David Koresh did.  I'm
just saying that the ATF (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops :-)

Let the FBI, Customs, and local police officers do the ATF's job.  WE

Including you?  What if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and
cut you in half with a machine gun?  THIS COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
Maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example.
It's happened before and it can happen *again*.  I have heard of more
than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  Just recently I
heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they
thought he had dope or something.  The guy blew both of the officers
away and he didn't go to jail for it.  The judge hearing the case
ruled that the man was acting in self-defense.

Are you sure that that would have been the way to go?  Surely the FBI
and ATF could have handled this fiasco better.  They didn't have to
massacre all those people.  As Stimpy said in ""Fake Dad"", ""Shame, shame,
double shame!""  The FBI and ATF should be ashamed of theirselves.

	If the militia has as its job the overthrow of an illegal
government, they are indeed useful weapons to the militia.  They
won't be too useful in certain areas, but leveling the Pentagon
would be a ""good thing"" for said overthrow and it's likely one man

armed with Colt Peacemakers.  Don't let self-defense become the

Myself, I won't overthrow my government until it ceases to be my
legal government, but if I need to I want every weapon I can get.

	One can just as easily say no rifle larger than a .22 is
needed to kill a human being.  They are right.  When that human
being is wearing armor and riding in an APC, things get a bit
different.  I don't see where the weapon is a problem.  It's not.
Only the manner of use is in contention here.

	I guess you either don't have an alarm clock or have never
heard the terms ""timer"" or ""martyr"" either.  Don't forget remote
detonation devices.  That CB radio in the pickup next to you can
easily transmit ten miles in decent weather.  That's out of the
blast radius of many portable nuclear devices.

On the news from radio station KANU (Lawrence, KS) about 6:15 this Monday
morning, I heard someone with a nasal-sounding voice (supposedly the Waco
coroner?) claim that he had found TWO persons killed with a single shot
to the forehead.

So far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found NO EVIDENCE
of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  If this continues to be
the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the FBI story,
wouldn't it?  And cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch
a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  The bullet hardly moves,
it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal
force.  It will hurt, yes, but not KILL you - I doubt if it wil penetrate
a coat, for example.

How about an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full subpoena powers, and
powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible
illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the BATF and FBI?  I
cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use
so often, ""if they have nothing to hide..."" they should welcome it,
and vigorously support it.  Note that an internal investigation by the
Dept of Justice is NOT an independent investigation...

Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is
good, or at least, better than the alternative.

Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the
number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these
accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.

...

In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. 
The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber
handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,
would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't
why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,
and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to
kill people.

>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show
>someone  that you have a gun and they go ""Gee, perhaps I should leave"".

In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses
of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer
not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what
you say when you point a gun at them.

If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to
immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is
about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work
the best.[3]

>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human
>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.

Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)
aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of
them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with
having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to
use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,
but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and
knowing how to use the tools to do that.

""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear
arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in
government.""

I think what Jefferson said is still true.

>And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes

Not very often compared to other use.[3]

>Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.

This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is
very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill
someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long
histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these
people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.

>Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to
>kill things.  Right?

Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I
never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from
rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than
is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them
to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,
I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and
ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm
after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,
people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,
particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

[2] RKBA.002 - Declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms
           Version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19)

DESCRIPTION
===========
The accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily 
for almost sixty years. In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per 
1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been 
steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate 
of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.

CONCLUSION
==========
Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over 
sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.

Follow more than one months posting.  As more than one reader has noted, 
there IS some reporting bias here.  I have seen months where these 
numbers were reversed.  I don't keep a constant tally, but it seems 
this particular issue had more shots fired than any other I can remember.

Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, 
""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so 
as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.

Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.

Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent
Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald
Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.

The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy
Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although
Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy
must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is
the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.
Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies
between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.
Cooper conceded that, ""You have all these things compressed into
a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.""

Cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm Colt Commando submachine
gun with a silenced barrel."" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]
Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific
plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.

When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's
M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for
sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.

Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)
had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, ""If
you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,
counselor.""  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of
the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by
killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's
virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions
were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained 
that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the
defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge
sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted
until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to
admonish both attorneys.  ""I'm not going to play games with either
counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start
acting like professionals.""

Spence told the judge that, ""When all the evidence is in, we'll see
that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that
he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events."" 
Spence continued, ""We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely
similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between
the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.""

Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated
objections would prevent a fair trial, ""We can't have a fair trial if the
jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm
bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm
violating court orders.""

Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's
objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and
denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict
his comments when objecting.

The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg
Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five
weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized
on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.

Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned
Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific
plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then
had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton
had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon
was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.
Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,
but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, ""I did not conduct
the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations
with him since the interview was conducted.""

Monday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled
is the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.

Here are a few ideas:

1) a free library card so they can look up the FBI
   Uniform Crime Report which shows how good HCI is
   at lying through their teeth,

2) a free RTD Transit Pass which will allow anti-gunners
   to tour South Central Los Angeles and convince
   people living there that they don't need guns to protect
   themselves because the police will do it for them 
   (don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out),

3) a free bus ride to Vermont, which has almost no gun
   control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either,

4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore
   been unable to figure out what a small percentage of
   the guns owned in America are used to commit violent crime.

Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will
start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
fire at once.
 
This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and
broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but
was really one big fire.
 
Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.
 
I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final
assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show
their agents of the the FBI overcoming the ""forces of evil"", aka
the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove
that they were not using excessive force.

|Question #2

|As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
|Is there any way to get around this provision?

Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun
ban as well, but does allow those with a ""collectors FFL"" to possess
(""collectible?"") handguns.

|What would the penalty if you were found out be?

Probably a fine in practical terms.

|What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment 
|there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
|trial for the shooting?

It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a
handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,
a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend
himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA
Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided
not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs
has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his
house, and told him: ""this is stepping over the line; this could get
dangerous for you."" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers
watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief
and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  

L.V. Cipriani states that the ""Any other weapon"" category is allowed,
but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular, which I
believe is in the ""Any other weapon"" category and a chopped barrel
H&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...

|One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
|rich or famous or related to the mayor?

In your dreams, buddy. As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois
residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians
get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry
concealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes
out of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois 
Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.
[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are
anti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney 
Jack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called ""Republican.""]

Get rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the IL
Judiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW
law...

And I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you ever
think that many people who use firearms to protect themselves
might not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which exist
forbidding concealed carry?

I already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and park
it behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someone
else, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably
not endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've never

Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?
I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.
The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since
they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-
burdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions of
gun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like to

Since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth,
you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with
the newsreporting if you care.

Many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he
is lying, change their stories to match his.  And if the Feds also
lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
stories to match the Feds.  

Neither sides are interested in the truth.  The Media is more interested,
but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
to the ratings and deliberately distort.  

For me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  I doubt the Feds
did that as they were more interested in arresting Vernon.  The real
unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was Vernon, so
I figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was Jesus 
being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto,
so made the decision.  He and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  Thsi conclusion, I came
to after umpteen million hours of listening to NPR and other radio
shows (I always have the radio going when I am in my office on some
innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).

      Fine, support your assertation.  But, you haven't supported

      The National Crime Survey, that secret Arm of the NRA, estimates
between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and
is considered to considerably under-report.  When broken down by weapon,
there is no form of ""self-defense"" including dowing nothing which is

hello,

I just want to make 2 points:

1) The FBI is not stupid. These people are chosen for their intelligence,
education, loyalty to the government, etc. They are given much intensive
training. So, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any
conspiracy here, and say that the FBI was just stupid, I say I don't
believe it.

2) The FBI has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the
latest digital systems. The FBI can manufacture evidence. Need a tape of
Koresh saying, ""light the fire"", and you can have one. Need a thermal
imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of
computer graphics, you can have one. The thing is, manufacturing these
pieces of evidence takes time. So it may be a few more days before we
get to see them. Or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any
FBI video is because it is:
	1) classified
	2) too gruesome for our eyes
	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it

Dwayne Jacques Fontenot

BTW, I get my information from live video feeds. I read the papers too,
but almost everything in them contradicts what I have seen with my own eyes.

Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of
    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost
    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to
    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers
    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of
    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government
    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military
    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are
    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments
    are afraid to trust the people with arms.""
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right
    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A
    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free
    country...""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of
    the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
    a year.""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing
    armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the
    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be
    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large
    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****
    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""
    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they
said ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Right
of the Militia""?...  ;-)

> Your average

You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and
probably females under current interpretation).

The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well
regulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check
how _well regulated_ I am.

Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that
was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a
""well organized militia"".

> It could be

What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set
h_bar = C = 1...

> instead of a separate sentence?

Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist
Papers?! 

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General
    Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
    recital of particulars.""

But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He
only wrote it.

That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist
Papers.

    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This
    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,
    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or
    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""

    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate
    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August
    1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the
    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...
    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of
    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order
    to raise an army upon their ruins.""

So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
our Liberties and Rights.

CCW's are issued at the discretion of the police chief, so it varies
town by town.

In my town, forget about anything more than ""target and sport"" (carry to
and from the gun club / hunting area only) unless you're Mr. Moneybags
with Large Daily Deposits.  (""Your life isn't worth shit, but your money --
now, that's important."")  In other towns, they treat law abiding citizens
like adults.  

Secret game hint: you never know when the rules will be changed -- a change 
in police chief can throw a town from either side of the board to the other
-- fun for the whole family!

Some chiefs will grant you a ""personal protection"" permit if you have been
attacked or threatened.  Some other blue-suited assholes have been known to 
count this as a NEGATIVE against applicants.

It's a crap shoot, and your rights are the stakes.

	At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame
war, I must disagree.
	
	There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often
chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does
basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the
fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less
training time required. 

	Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht
they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which
if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun
from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and
would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various 
gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little
test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked
people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and
shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times
were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or
the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.

	You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger
which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing
city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..

	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but
such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I
know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off
chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that
'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time
to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.

	Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks
in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,
it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the
operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I
don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.

	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree
100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.

Seems to me folks, that if you are so interested in acquiring CNN, just
buy your $1000 worth of stock today.  It's being traded everyday.  After you

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is
""just"" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't
have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I
was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968
8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be
moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked
my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face
felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after
exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a
dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I
doubt whether I could find the exit. Indeed, I can't imagine living through
it.

       If you want to talk ""less likely to get killed with a handgun""
you'd have a point.  ""Safer"" includes other things than simply handguns,
and you can't conclude ""safer"" by ignoring them.

As a ""favorite"", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in
Chicago produced this table:

		Percentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks
			    Resulting in Death
			    
	Weapon				Deaths As Percentage of Attacks
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	Knives (16,518 total attacks)		 2.4
	Guns (6,350 total attacks)		12.2

	Source: Firearms and Violence in American Life
	
It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns
that they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were
so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide
would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in
cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show
a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this
not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife
attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks
(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),
the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the
proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.

What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on
the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended
to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave
physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the
head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this
pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of
rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not
fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and
Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic
differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found
myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I
don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent
crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every
law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.

On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,
seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities
with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.

In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After
a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed
weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.

In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason
to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.
Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are
regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a
restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in
order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns
transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.
In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.

Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for
gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers
studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),
burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from
1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same
standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.

Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver
(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).
18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in
Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /
1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher
(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by
weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.
Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated
assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were
far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.

Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle
(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).
After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as
compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.

When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate
of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in
Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.
Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to
a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns
accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns
were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than
in Vancouver.

The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable""
homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during
the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only
21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in
Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After
excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these
earlier findings.

-------

This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the
argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because
Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times
that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports
annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.

Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access
to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because
persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a
gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.
If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by
the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we
could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to
be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study
interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns
was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that
few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.

As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding
citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did
experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these
cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities
during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,
Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category
over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for
self-defense.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.

Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges.
They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID
impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED.

Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not
federal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably,
and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.

So maybe the best way for BATF/FBI to save people is to mind their 
own fucking business.

That is undeniable truth.  My heart bleeds just as much as yours for 
the children who were never released given 51 days of ample opportunities 
to do so.  My heart also bleeds for people so blinded by religious devotion

I do not think this.  However, if they did set the fire (which started in 
more than one place and spread very quickly), then they got what they 
wanted and put into motion themselves.

I see the BATF is going to be investigated by the Justice Dept. and likely 
by Arlen Spectre and congress.  This is good.  They have bungled the affair 
from the start.

Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have

The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in
wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including 
nnocent children.

For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George

(When questioned about it, his reply was that the treaty did

	I think I have updated info on this.  My understandingis that
former officer Cranston approached a teenager who was being questioned
by another officer.   Officer Cranston struck Teenager A in the head
with a heavy police flashlight, causing a significant, though not
life-threatening.  THere is no evidence that Teenager A was
doing anything threatening at the time.  Teenager A was released
on bail/recognizance and filed a formal complaint against Officer
Cranston.  The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an 
investigation into the use of excessive force.  
	The above is pretty clear... but what seems to have 
happened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston
refused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home
 to get it.  Sources said Cranston had always wanted to be
a cop and was very afraid of loosing his job because of the complaint
against him.
	A few days afterward, Cranston allegedly walked into 
Wilson's Garage, where Teenager A and friends were known to
hang out and work on cars as a hobby.  Cranston fatally shot
Teenager A as well as TEenagers B and C.  Teenager D was shot once
in the shoulder/chest.  Teenager E was working under the car
and was not noticed by Officer Cranston.  Teenager D went to a home
and summoned police, who went to Wilson's Garage and found the 
3 corpses and one unscathed survivor.

	A few days after his arrest, Officer Cranston attemped
to commit suicide in his cell.

Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been
stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how
likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He
was concerned with the safety of the children.
 
What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure
Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI
offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the
permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?
 
What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.
They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their
electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears
with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept
limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on
David Koresh.
 
Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping
to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack
the the tanks.
 
It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over
the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the
federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools
at the ATF who planed the raid.
 
Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have
resulted in the needless death of 90 innocent people.
 
If every thing had gone as planned 90 people would be alive today.
Instead the ATF screwed up and caused the death of 90+.  Incompetent
law enforcement can kill you!

Hm.  A previous poster argued that the fact that the BD's did not rush to
escape the burning building indicated that it was they, and not any of the
government actions, that started the fire.  On the other hand, I wonder if,
with a face full of ""massive amounts of CS,"" *I* would be able to escape

	Why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately?  The NRA
is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame
to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a
lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.  Mention

Hello,

	I understand this philosophy.  The bears are a national
treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it
do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be
killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy
visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans
are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.
I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.

	The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national
treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to ""allow""
provision for defense against them would also ""allow"" provision
for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided
that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than
to take a chance on threatening the bears.

	Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be
""managed"" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think
of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)

I don't recall saying Baptists do any of that.  Though I suppose some do.  And  
none of them are listed in the dictionary as characteristics of a cult.  My

Far from it, I defend the rights of anyone to be different under our

How can you say that?  I presume that you mean that talking about

arguing for those restrictions may lead to implementation, much
the same way as assault can lead to battery (legal definitions).

Well, I can't speak for the homosexuals, but I've seen ALOT
of polite discussion on t.p.g.  Please, everyone, don't take
this guy's word, or mine for that matter, on it.  Read t.p.g.
for a while, and try to determine from which direction most of
the flameage originates.  If you post without flamebait, you
will generally receive reasoned responses.  True, there are
those who tend to lose their tempers quickly, as there are on
all newsgroups, but they really do feel their rights are in jeopardy.

Oh, and neat trick talking derisively about another newsgroup while

I have NEVER spoken for a ban against guns in America !

Now IF you would like to reduce the number, how would you do it without affecting
good/responcible gun owners ??


I DO believe in a persons freedom.
What I don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.

MOST europeans believe in a society of individuals, and that you HAVE
to give 'a little' to make that society work.

Cars and guns should really not be mixed, I just tried to make a point.
Like America, Norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b,
so a car is essential in most parts....

Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't 
argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....


EVERYONE who believe that Hitler and WW2 could be avoided if there were
more guns in Germany in the 30's: PLEASE read some HISTORY!


Is this discussion about

I still think there are 'some' posters should move their post to alt.conspiracy

Did the BATF get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.
(Child abuse for instance)

Doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* hierarcy ??

What would you do in the following hypothetical situations?

You have committed no crime.  The BATF conducts a ""no-knock"" raid.
a) Hands in air. Say ""Do you have a warrant?"" Think of hefty suit settlement.
b) Say ""You have 1 second to identify yourself as a cop or I shoot.""
c) Shoot.  Heck, at least in federal prison you might get to have sex.

You have killed federal agents. They blast strange music at you.
a) Come out with hands up. ""I wish to turn state's evidence."" Hope deal's good.
b) Wait, figuring other federal agents will get bored and go on vacation.
c) Wait. If they come after you there will be a chance to kill MORE g-men.

The FBI has you surrounded, asks you to come out immediately.
a) Come out, figuring long prison term is chance to catch up on some writing.
b) Stall. You just can't concentrate when you're on trial for some reason.
c) Decide to write novel-length prophecy now while ideas are fresh in mind.

FBI calls and says they will use tear gas if you don't come out.
a) Come out with hands up. Your radical bro-in-law hated getting gassed at UC.
b) Get out your gas mask. Really, these feds will have to give up eventually.
c) Shoot at vehicles delivering tear gas. It's rude to break down a man's door!

FBI calls and says they will use tanks to break down your walls.
a) Come out with your hands up. Flimsy cardboard construction won't last long.
b) With presence of mind, move flammable devices away from tinder-dry haybales.
c) Spread some kerosene around and hit a match. Big Schwarzenegger ending.

Points are awarded in the following manner: 0 points for every (a) answer,
-1 points for every (b) answer, and -2 points for every (c) answer.
Count 'em up and compare with your friends!

If you answered (a) all the time, you are probably in jail, but alive.
If you answered (b) all the time, you may still be holed up in your compound.
If you answered (c) all the time, you are probably dead.

Let's see if I have this straight.  A law is created that says ""you can not
have a automatic weapon"" and therefore it's ok for the government to use
any level of force to enforce that law.  Doesn't matter if the entire 
population of the planet is destroyed as long as that law is obeyed.

Do I read you correctly?

Those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)
are getting quite a giggle out of this.  I'd estimate that 5% of
the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (I was one of the
few who failed shop.)  People who have actually seen me do mechanical
work would probably say that 1% is more like it.

Starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that
""enough"" people will be motivated.

How much is ""through the nose""?  After all, we know quite a bit
about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed
by the price demanded by the ""bad"" part of that 90%....

The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The ""profit"" of
gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals
out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.
That analysis ignored some ""improvements"" in the criminal gun
market that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficiently
used now, but a ""loaner"" set up would drive the value still higher
without affecting criminal use.)

In this case, it was unimportant as to who set the fire.  The Davidians
would have burned no matter what, ESPECIALLY if the BATF/FBI set the
fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to Vernon Howell and
therefore rocket to heaven.  A few comments from the remaining
Davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this
theory (One cult member said that she wished that she had been there,
and that now she would have to wait for Vernon to Return for them.  She
actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).

While I think that Vernon started the fire (his followers anyway), 
it is incidental to their reaction.

Rocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper.

	SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDE

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for
allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth
worked, said ""You're going to die"" and fatally shot him and two others, police
said.

A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.

The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about
midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition Wednesday.

Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at
gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in
Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.

	Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, just

The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (because

I've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially,
albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.

I don't know about the other papers.

Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?

But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never
manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their
laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.

Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION
licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of
licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX.
Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.

Does passing laws that will further restricting only those people ALREADY
obeying laws pay any dividents?

So far, I've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators.

See, this is what I call the ""argument from religion:"" ""I believe.""  Don't
believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history
of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to
whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER
after.  (Don't look at ""violent gun crimes,"" that's begging the question.)
You may be very surprised.

> If ALL crimes done with guns stopped AND all accidents also stopped or
> was reduced to a minimum THEN I would consider lifting all gun control.

You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of
strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.
However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent 
crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it.

So far, none of the stats show any improvement...

Do you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity
for having accidents?  

I've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while 
drunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the 
back seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on 
makeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone.  
But that's what they're doing when they have those accidents.

Or claims to have discovered so...  It would hardly be the first time

It was a ""no-knock"", according to the Associated Press report.
Here's something I found in my collection:

    Excerpts from an article in the Knoxville News-Sentinel Final
    Edition Monday, March 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):

    WACO, Texas - Fierce gun battles erupted Sunday as more than 100
    law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
    religious cult.  At least four federal agents and two cult members
    were reported killed.  [...]

    The gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
    trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters Sunday morning,
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    witnesses said.  The agents had warrants to search for guns and
    explosives and to arrest Howell, said Les Stanford of the ATF in
    Washington.  [...]

    Witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,
    throwing concussion grenades and screaming ""Come out,"" while three
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    National Guard helicopters approached.  For a moment, there was no
    response.  Then the shooting began. 

I think ""storming the sect's head-quaters"" and ""throwing concussion
grenades"" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).

Sorry, BATF are ""Federal TAX Enforcement officials"".  They're not

Which crap, the ridiculous assertions that Uzis are mowing down cops
right and left? The assertions that dialing 911 should be the proper
and only option available to the law-abiding citizens?

A factoid:

56 cops were killed in the whole country last year. This is down from
around 100 in the early '80s. Wow, a real explosion in cop killings
there eh?  :-)

Ain't got a pair of fatigues... and I don't blast people wandering aimlessly,
I ask them what they're doing there... I only blast people who display
obvious violent intent... like black-clad men with weapons climbing thru
second-story windows, or people who break down the door instead of knocking.
Or people who knock my house down with tanks and set it afire.  Sound 
familiar yet?

make a case for cruel and unusual punishment, playing the sounds of
tortured rabbits over the loudspeakers (where's the SPCA in all this?)...

Flame on!!

Is this guy serious????

If he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops I forgot that the media
   for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts 
   are known, as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe). 
   Any ways one of Koresh's DEVOTED followers that DID I REPEAT DID survive this
   ""GENOCIDAL MASS-SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT PEOPLE"".  Besides there are nine 
   survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that David
   was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  Besides, a majority of 
   these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,
   this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).  Also
   someone should have told David and his followers that if they can't the heat
   then they should stay out of the kitchen!! (pun intended)

Flame off

Not to mention that the story was rewritten today. Those two BD's who
""admitted to starting the fire"", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.
Today, ""a few saw someone starting a fire"" and ""our aerial surveillance
showed them starting fires"" at this morning's press conference. 
Tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. A reporter pointed out
that a BD being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking
over lanterns started the fire. Curiouser and curiouser.

No, Lt Calley was later acquitted. His troops killed 400-500
people, including kids, elderly and women... I sure don't want
to see the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country

I tend to agree, but I would like a better explanation of why the FBI stopped  
the firetrucks at the gate.  I saw this in realtime.  It concerns me that the  
FBI ""appeared"" to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started,  
and actually started flying hueys around the compound, which had to add in some  
small part to the winds driving the fire.

Okay.  I have my copies of all relevant gun-control bills.  I'm mad as hell.

Who do I write?

Who should I concentrate on writing my comments to?  The actual author of the

Magazines?  All of the above?

I don't believe that I will change the world, but at least I am going to throw

Thankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without
having to use a firearm.  Howver, there are situations where firearms
are the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do
you propose as equally effective?

New to this country? New to political theory?
Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at
republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and
political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a
Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain
rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the
majority.

This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not
immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.
Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does
prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.  
As far as ""enough active voters"" are concerned, that is still
an open question until the vote is made.

You portray a possible scenario for the future.  But, how will you
silence RKBA supporters right now?  As long as public debate is
allowed, such debate will continue. If we allow public debate to be
restricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.

____________________________________________________________________________

To: William J. Clinton
    President of the United States of America

Mr. President:

I am writing to express my utter outrage at the conduct of various
government agencies in regards to the tragedy in Waco.  I DEMAND
the dismissal or resignation of Lloyd Bensen, Secretary of the Treasury,
who bears responsibility for the initial helicopter and grenade attack 
by the ATF against the Branch Davidians, and of Janet Reno, who authorized 
the final assault on the very day that we were commemorating the Warsaw
ghetto revolt.  And I would truly appreciate it if you would make
sure something like this never happens again on your watch.

Respectfully yours,

The best reason to abolishing the ATF is that they don't have enough
to do.  If the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
the FBI (firearms) and IRS (tobacco and alcohol).  Both of these
organizations have enough to do.  The FBI is probably not going to try
to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
gun.
 
There have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
divided and and weak.  But there is nothing more dangerous to
liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to
chase.  The ATF is one and look at the trouble it started in
Waco.

There were some significant differences.  Whereas the Branch Davidians are
reported to have gotten along rather well with their neighbors, the MOVE
people are generally conceded to have gone far out of the way to antagonize
their BLACK neighbors, using loudspeakers to all hours of the night, keeping
large piles of garbage, promoting rat and insect infestation, and allegedly
threatening to kidnap their neighbors' children.

Still the same sort of questions regarding use of force remain in that case.

  You are correct WRT the idea of some heating being nice that morning.  But 
part of that line was also for the guy who said ""minutes later, the fires
started"".  I did forget how cool it was that day.

What laws did they circumvent?  Being ""frightening"" isn't a crime.  Some people
are afraid of young Black males.  That doesn't make the mere status of being a
young Black male a crime.

The BATF itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  There is no
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
personnel.  Under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
armed intruders.

The charges are irrlevant anyway, since the BATF has absolutely no jurisdiction
in such matters anyway.  Of course that hasn't stopped them from making other
such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical ""meth labs"".  Of
course they whole ""cult"" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
for the 1st amendment.

Attention please!

According to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates
to the point where Hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared
ended.  I would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  Clearly
further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the

by the standards of usenet talk groups.

If you must continue, please don't discuss this in misc.legal.  It's not

Waco incident, please ask questions of the form: ""if the FBI started the

Two questions:

1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for
   ""real hunting"".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using
   self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not

Today the Texas ME found two people, a man and a woman shot in the head
inside the burned compound. But these were not the people that the FBI
described a few days before. The FBI said that the person found in front of
the compound had been shot and several children were also. The two people
found today were on top of the main inside concrete bunker that provided
the most protection during the fire. So the comment that children were
shot is still not proved.

I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:

The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will
NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,
the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.

Anyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'
interpretations...

1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.
2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have
   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think
   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
   noncombatants.
3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait
   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused
   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
   10-20 years in jail.
4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,
   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.

The suggestion that they Davidians committed suicide is
completely without evidence.  Except for the editorials...

Please re-word.  ""propensity for allegedly dousing themselves"".

Oh, and the survivors claim the the FBI started the burning
by accidentally igniting kerosene lanterns (remember that they'd

a lot more likely than committing suicide by setting the place

Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing

Saying ""hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y"" is *much* different
from saying ""hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y.""
Here you've made both statements.
If the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy X, then
perhaps policy X is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement
is not something to base policy decisions on!

> Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
>ages 14 and under.

According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly
the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you
think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the ""leading causes of
unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other
means as causes of unintentional death.  Can't you see past the bullshit?

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the
anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use
these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm
sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.
The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.

Sorry if it wasn't clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on
all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who
aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to
commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a
positive way for police to respond to ""interpersonal violence.""

What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit

METHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call
everyone up to age 24 ""children"" when they're screaming about the ""carnage
of our nation's children"" being caused by handguns?

>or the Centers for Disease Control.

Ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People
2000 document is to ""enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the
likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?""  The
agency that funded the ""study"" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban
had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of
a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?
It wasn't their fault that the population of DC dropped in their ""post law""
period...

Okay, I'll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these.  I'll

in seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers.

What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary
school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a
problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the
car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,
it's the parents!!!

And what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?
NOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even
suspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say ""ain't it
awful,"" and go on as if everything's back to normal.  What's wrong with
this picture?

I don't think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he
believed the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn't say
he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
he thought was going on.  He thought he had them in the one place where
harm *wouldn't* come to them.

Let's see *you* try to find the exits, unbarricade them, and flee a fire
when you've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected
to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.

Unlikely.  Ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it
is when fired from a gun.  The brass case is not capable of holding
the pressure generated by burning powder, and will (unless supported
by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open.  While
this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around, it will not
propel the bullet with any significant velocity.

In fact, it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded
cartridges by burning them.  As long as you were not close enough
to take a piece of flying brass in the eye, you were reasonably safe.

Thus, the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause
slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.

Could someone email me a USNail address for the NRA? I'd like to write them
a letter encouraging them to see to it VERY EMPHATICALLY that the 2nd
amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
did in Waco.

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they
intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.
SUSPECTS child abuse. Maybe yours! Maybe mine!
And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

Time was when the U.S. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
Now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
half of civilians.

So?  Look in the trunk some time.  Heck - look at the dash.  That
funny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  The ones in the
trunk are ""better"".  (I don't have numbers for Chicago, but
Philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and
thousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)

What is the nature of this disadvantage?  If the cop can shoot, 6
rounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since the
cop has guaranteed backup).  If the ""gang member"" can shoot, the extra
rounds don't help.  The only time this difference can matter is if
neither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around
like that.

BTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to know
about the second, third, and so on.

>I have been at a shooting range where

How do ""we"" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops
or even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?

They were actually practicing
>taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target
>and they weren't doing too badly either.

Then the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?

Even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
but a search warrant.  In other words, there was no evidence of illegal
arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
search for illegal evidence.

Question:  As in the Rodney King case, will the US DOJ institute
criminal civil rights proceedings against the BATF?  Or at least an
investigation?  OK, sorry I asked.

They threatened no one.  Their neighbours thought they were a little
strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live
next door to.

One version has the BATF serving a *search* warrant by jumping out
of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades.  If
this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know
that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof
that these guys were police,  the 'cult' had every right to defend
themselves.

: Torching themselves shows briliant tactics, and convinces me
: they *realy* belong in society ...

If you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it
is not at all clear that fire wasn't started by the tanks.  The
people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by
the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns.  The FBI is
claiming that the 'cult' started the fire.

'they *realy* belong in society' is a catchy phrase but
I'm personally waiting to see what the Texas Rangers have to say
about it all before I pass judgment.   Why don't you do the same.

Some more interesting facts about the Waco incident:

1)  The original assault was conducted by BATF officers wearing
    an assorted types of camouflage.  I saw, on CNN, at least
    three different types.   I would be hard pressed to identify
    a bunch of guys in 'bring-your-own' battle fatigues as
    uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to
    be police.
    
2)  The BATF has been lying from the beginning:
    + ""We only had handguns"" - the original footage showed 4 BATF
      officers on a roof top getting shot at,  one had an MP-5
      assault sub-machine gun.
    + ""We were out gunned"" - sub-machine guns and shotguns are the
      BEST in quarters weapon,  you can't be out gunned when you
      have the best guns available for the job.
    + ""We didn't know they had guns that would shoot through doors!"" -
      this one is the best,  there are very few guns that won't shoot
      through a household door,  or through a house WALL for that
      matter.  Since officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
      *Firearms* should know that,  they are either lying or incredibly
      incompetent.  Not to mention criminally negligent if they are
      shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter
      plywood.
    + ""We had a search warrant.  Actually, we had an arrest warrant.
       No, wait,  we had both.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
       Oh, and they're child molesters too.  And they make *drugs*.
       Did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.""
      - The story from BATF and FBI spokespeople has changed daily
      and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.
      
3)  Throughout the siege the FBI and BATF have be claiming that one
    of their biggest concerns was that Koresh and his followers would
    mass suicide.   Now they are claiming that that's what he did
    AND that they are surprised that he did.  Huh?

All in all I think that anything the FBI and BATF say should be
taken with a grain or two of salt.

The President is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a
raid, nor does he need to be.  His job is to set basic policies and
manage the people under him.  If Clinton instructed Reno to preserve
lives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as
could be, then he did his job.  The President should not involve
himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  This sort
of micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well
in Vietnam.

But the raid went bad:  Over 80 civilians have been killed in a
controntation with U.S. authorities.

NOW Clinton enters the picture in a big way.  Will Clinton start an
investigation?  Or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate?
Is he a responsible leader?  Or is he only interested in protecting
the image of his administration?

We'll all find out as this unfolds.

Can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes? Bullets go flying every
where. IMHO, these ""gunshot wounds"" were actually caused when the magazines 
went up. A Texas ranger does not a pathologist make, so I'll wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first. 

Either way, they're all dead and the FBI & Atty. Gen. Vampria are still
responable.

Actually if 'a few minutes' translates into 6 hours, you have it
right.  BUT you (and I guess your single-source news agency CNN)
failed to mention the Davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain

Sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound.
The Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their
own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.

Self-slaughter, anyway.  I pity the children who were to young to be able

  UPI Washington DC, Update Desk			4/15/93

  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been
  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most
  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the 
  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area
  of jobs creation.

  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,
  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed
  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting
  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.

  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.
  ""It's the guns"" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other
  ""gun-nuts"" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the
  economy out of the recession.  ""Their buying them five times faster than
  ever before, and stockpiling left and right"", the Vice President said.  

  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have
  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several
  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have
  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.

  ""We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people"", said
  the President of Colt industries.  ""As long as Clinton is in office, we
  suspect it will"", he added.

  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new
  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's 
  called the ""Ban-One-A-Month"" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,
  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index 
  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw
  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any
  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the
  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.

  The President said, ""This law will benefit America two ways.  When the
  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run
  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,
  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the
  street.""  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee
  this program, citing her ""Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject
  of gun control"".

  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an
  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing
  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  ""Their stockpiling,
  stockpiling, stockpiling"" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference
  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.

  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment
  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been
  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, ""First we'll
  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning"", during a press
  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate
  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow
  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require
  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,
  after all of the cards have been drawn.

  The head of the BATF responded by saying, ""We will have to see if this
  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those
  guns"".

  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado
  declared this proposed law as being ""reasonable gun control which won't
  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns"".

    The lethality in small part, but mostly what I found frightening 
was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they 
ate breakfast every morning with Jesus Christ. Now I wasn't there in 
Galilee back in the Roman occupation, so I don't know for certain that 
David Koresh was not Jesus Christ, but I strongly suspect that he was 
not (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph 
together).

    I admit I can't cite a specific, but if there isn't a law against 
purchasing grenade components and assembling them into functioning units 
then perhaps we need one. All second ammendment arguments aside, I'm just 
not sure that I like the idea of private citizens with hand grenades.

Of course, if you're a criminal, or hang around with criminals, or
flash large wads of cash in the wilder parts of town, or utter verbal
bigotry in the right public places, your chances of being shot are much
higher.

Avoiding these behaviors, on the other hand, decreases your chances of
being shot.

Something like 60% of all murders are criminals killing criminals. 
Over 90% of murders are committed by people with a prior *known*
history of violence.

                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE

[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- 
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with 
the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]

Dear Adrian:  

I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to 
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and 
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist 
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back 
with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present 
now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the 
future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  

There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger 
of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 
10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, 
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic 
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll 
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent 
with your note.  

First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't 
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my 
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  

Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't 
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions 
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older 
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  

Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on 
countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND 
BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this 
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  

Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat 
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you 
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in 
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our 
ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree 
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  
More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s 
clearly indicate the contrary.  

Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human 
behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The 
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the 
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  

Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates 
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but 
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social 
benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a 
criminal offense.  

Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials 
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are 
many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless 
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it 
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that 
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, 
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's 
permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists 
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed 
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  
Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" 
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, 
ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in 
the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, 
and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we 
probably manufacture at least that many every year.

The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly 
aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what 
their real motives are.  

Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, 
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; 
the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the 
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing 
this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a 
quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" 
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna 
be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.

As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law 
provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I 
will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is 
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands 
-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can 
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given 
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics 
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  

So what's the point?

This is REALLY STUPID nitpicking.  Capitalization rules in the late 18th
century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current
capitalization rules.

We also don't make 's' look like 'f' and other such things done in the late
seventeen hundreds.

In the original Constitution, ""militia"", ""arms"", etc. were capitalized simply
because they were nouns.  This is also done currently in German.  There is
no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.
The capitalization denotes no special emphasis.

    CRIMESTRIKE HITS TOWN

    With the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists
    that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the
    same column), we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re-
    moving criminals from the streets the National Rifle Association's
    new CrimeStrike project, engineered by Arizona's former chief assist-
    ant attorney general Steven J. Twist.

    CrimeStrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily
    crime.  It is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally,
    including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that Arizona is
    applying with its Truth in Sentencing law; funding construction and
    staffing of appropriate prison space; ensuring that the system is
    primed to punish serious youthful offenders; strict attention to the
    rights of victims; and citizen and community involvement.

    Phoenix will be the home for this national organization.

    The Gazette has vigorously opposed many NRA policies on issues of gun
    control, and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek
    reasonable regulation of firearms.

    But CrimeStrike is an appropriate creation, a response to a clear
    need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac-
    countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.

    When an organization has an issue, it has an issue, and Crime-
    Strike has it - especially when it is willing to direct its dollars
    to getting criminals off the street.

    We say, welcome to town.

Not very.  Thanks to the filibuster in the Senate, things are backing up.  The

I don't know for sure if Winchester made any commemeratives.  If I
recall correctly, the rifle itself was a .44-40 Model 92 with an
oversized loop lever.  I don't think Winchester makes this rifle
any more.  Rossi make a Model 92 look-alike in .38 Special and
.357 Magnum.

This whole thread is rediculous.  Who cares if they had a stove going
or not.  Does it matter if they had a stove burning, or lanterns
burning, or candles burning, or someone smoking, etc, etc, etc.  The
premise is that the FBI was filling the house with napalm so that it
would catch fire.  This is crazy.  FBI was NOT PUMPING NAPALM into the
Davidians home.  You will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to
convince me of that.

I can believe mass suicide/murder by Koresh.  I can believe an
accident by the Davidians.  I can believe an accident by the FBI.  I
can easily believe mass stupidity on all sides but I can not believe
that the FBI lit this fire intentionally.  No way.

I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the
fire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_
started the fire.

From my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

>napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
in Texas.  It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
stove to ignite the ""napalm"" when the stove would probably not be in use.  And 
I doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

It's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a 
""fiery apocalypse""...just a thought.

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the
timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of
wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new""
that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going
to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't
it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early
after the assault began?  

The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting
of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
(watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.
Specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of
the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been 
penetrating a few feet.

reserving judgement,

Ask the Brits.  Enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they now
use them under only certain ""controlled"" circumstances.  And they are fired
from something that looks like a tear gas launcher.

There are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns).  I understand that
they are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly
dangerous animal.  In general, they do not seem capable of really stopping
someone who wants you or past you.  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity
(the .38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load).  Finally, as your mother
warned you, you can put an eye out with that thing.  :-)

=============================================================
Hi Folks;

Thursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy
U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.

The short version is that his testimony was consistent with
the opening statements for the prosecution.

Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)
on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation
with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was
using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up
into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an
observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies
Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to
scout further possible surveillance sites.

Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into
a gully to see, ""whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.""
Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking
loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.

They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the
""fern field""] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin
Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance
team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should
take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy
target and might be ""shot in the back.""

As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the
road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.

At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to ""fend
him off with his gun.""  [It is unclear whether this means he
clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then
took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and
Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not
noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan
got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, ""Stop!  U.S.
Marshal!""  Harris then ""...brought the weapon around at hip level
and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw
Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.""  Cooper fired
at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon
to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then
heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the
direction of the shots, yelled, ""You son of a bitch!"" and ran
toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him
from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the
cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward
the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two
fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and
then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the
other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large
burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.

On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of
throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, ""You wanted to lure that
dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?""  Nevin also
pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had
claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.
Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and
decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the
cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an
armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at
him [no answer was available].

Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.

Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

No.  I see many of the same groups protesting both.  I also know people
who feel exactly the opposite (i.e., treat citizens better than Saddam).

-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the
""well regulated malitia.""  Here is what is says about its character:

	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
	 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
	 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to
	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
	 character of a well-regulated militia, 

It also talks about the ""well regulated militia"" having a nationally
uniform in structure and disipline.  

I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:

    	Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
	respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
	and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
	a year.

But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large
group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people
every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can
be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it 
requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  

Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and
disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim
a ""well regulated militia"" is not well organized.  But I will concide 
a ""well organized militia"" is not necessarily a ""well regulated militia."" 

Several people have stated that the ""well organized militia"" is
what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states

	The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied 
	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in 
	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, 
	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, 
	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of 
	the United States who are commissioned officers of the 
	National Guard.

This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective ""well regulated.""
10 USC 311 does not define a ""well regualed militia"" in any way, shape, 
or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia
The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the ""well regualed militia"" as a
proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it
talk above ""disciplining all the militia of the United States"" so they
fit the ""character of a well-regulated militia.""  This is what the
paragraph states about the associated costs:

	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 
	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the 
	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short 
	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all 
	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the 
	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,
	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not 
	succeed, because it would not long be endured.


Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:
James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General Welfare"" clause): 
	""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
	recital of particulars.""

So the phrase ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall 
not be infringed"" must either qualify or explain the phrase ""a well 
regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.""  
The definition of ""explain"" as stated in ""The American Hertitage
Dictionary of the Enlish Language"" The New College Edition, 1982 is:
	1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;
	   elucidate: ""It was the economists who undertook to explain 
	   this puzzle""
	2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.
	3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:
	   explain an error
The second phrase clearly does not ""explain"" the first, therefore
the second phrase must ""qualify"" the first.  The definition given
for ""qualify"" is:
	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities
	   of; characterize.
	2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or 
	   task.
	3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.
	4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.
	5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate
	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)
Since ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed"" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and
it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.
By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since
#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it
must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, ""the right 
of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well 
regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".  

I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more 
evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the 
people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little 
about the right of an untrained person to ""keep and bear"" a .50 caliber
machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm
(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun
safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine
gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with
me.

-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
-> our Liberties and Rights.

I mean ""to destory our Liberties and Rights.""  Is that why a participate
in the discussion of exactly what ""our Libertues and Rights"" are?  I 
force my version of ""our Liberties and Rights"" by begining statements
of what ""our Liberties and Rights"" with ""All that the Second Amendment 
clearly states to me.""   Using expressions, such as ""states to me,"" 
clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.

So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties and
Rights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in
the matter of ""Liberties and Rights"" is the final word.  For I am only
one person among many and the final word on ""Liberties and Rights"" cleary
and irrevocably belongs to the many.

   I agree very much.  I have read almost every article written about
   the Glock, and IMO, it is probably the safest auto-loader made.  It
   has the best safty of all, Jeff Cooper's First Rule, ""Keep your finger
   OFF the trigger until you want to shoot.""  If everyone just observed
   this, there would be fewer ""accidents"".

If amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder
and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not.
This way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to 
prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute.
Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the total
eradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check for
stolen property.  If they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would have
to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns.

Probably had a few like that in Nazi Germany, as well.

Oh yeah, ATF/FBI now claims, according the the media, that there are

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,  
and the FBI stopped the firetrucks at the gate. 

Something was VERY wrong with that scene.

Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying.

Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  
they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  
in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge.

And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  
witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  
the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   
Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

Excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he
doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings. He
also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous. I don't hear any of these
other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the
same time, he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time, 
so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are

so well? Hmm?

They'd probably quote Montesque (sp?) who was once asked if Russia

Russia is a nation of slaves and the people get what they deserve.""
Since he said that, Russia has changed a great deal. But so,

I'd hardly call that ""giving up his chance to be Vice President of the US"";
the chance of the Populist Party ticket winning is essentially nil.  Still,

I'm responding at the risk of misreading your response, but I do have to tell 
my fellow conservatives to give it up, attacking Reno/Clinton/ATF/FBI.

They may have botched an operation, but they didn't kill anybody who never shot
at them first.  David Koresh was a frigging lunatic.  His followers had the 
combined I.Q of a Geraldo audience.  The kids probably would have been those
fucked up social rejects who go to Freshman dances in high school, never to be
seen again (except maybe in the band) until prom, when they show up like 
animals boarding the ark.  Then it's bowling till 3 in the morning..... 
(WHY....WHY?? did it happen to me??!!)

Anyway, the point is Janet Reno/Bill Clinton were only following the advice of 
trained, law enforcement officials who were experts in their fields.  I'd 
rather have our leaders do that then micro-manage every crisis that comes 
along.  Then you'd really see trouble no matter what party or ideology the 
President and her (er.. I mean his) Attorney General is.

By this, do you mean that you consider it absolutely impossible for the
media to be guilty of hypocrisy?

Note that the film industry in California traded their political support
for an ""assault weapon"" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill
exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.

Note that the very issue of the Batman comic book (""Seduction of the Gun"")
that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back-
page ad for a ""Terminator II"" video game extolling the numerous and
varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.

Note that Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the NY Times -- one of the
oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a
concealed handgun.

Still, you find it completely incredible that these folks live by the 
aphorism, ""Do as I say, and not as I do.""

What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of

more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed

With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with

       As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police
release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate
federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they
weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.

       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

       What people say they want public today may not be what they
say tomorrow.

For those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out:

    ""Also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the
     US attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents,
     including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities
     planned to use when the siege was over.

    ""These documents did not include the original warrants the Bureau of
     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms had in late February, which to this
     day have never been released.

    ""...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek
     samples of Koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had
     signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused
     'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly
     the ATF.'""

So, one of the charges against Koresh seems to be Contempt of Cop -- he
expressed hostility to the BATF.  That chilly feeling in your gonads is 
perfectly normal, folks... it should go away in about 51 days.

        The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Just from experience, seeing a couple of houses burn down, one doesn't
need any accelerant to get a lot of black soot.  There's plenty of
stuff in a house that will burn 'dirty'.  Even the asphalt shingles
would make a really sooty smoke.

Proper counter to this claim:  ""Forensic analysis of the WTC bomb by

being to have persuaded the bull to consume the taggants before

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley
in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted 
as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't
consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though
the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the ""gun owner"" column.

Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The ""average threat
level"" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well
known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because 
they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to
Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the 
""average threat level in the country"" means to a resident there.

Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors 
on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once
told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the
original text, but the story started with one resident calling the 
cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a 
drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,
unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting
an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane,
your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell
anything.

Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.  
That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches 
on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue
cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if --
DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of
these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.

You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your
government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar,
blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the
power to enforce your ""rights"" but you.  Unless you've given up that 
power.

Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to
believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun 
ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T 
any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to
try to raise their consciousness.

> 	Argue away ... you can't win. 

I think we can.

HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a ""One 
Million Strong!"" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  
My understanding is that they ""reached"" it by the stratagem of including
wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak
authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they
started running a ""Two Million Strong!"" campaign for a while -- but they
let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they
simply were never going to reach that level of membership.

In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting
point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  
By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had 
about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the
third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).
And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical
figures from Kukla's ""Gun Control,"" pp. 61 and 420.)

As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused
by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against 
hard-core gun banners.

I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.
I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.

Yes, I think we can and will win this one.

I think they would be used far less to hammer nails, as well, but,

			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT

			      by J. Neil Schulman

If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,
right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call
would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call
if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?

That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor
journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of
""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise.

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's
fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.

That sounds like an expert to me.

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent
the following letter:

""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.

""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being
necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
oath to support, if necessary.""

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,
then concluded:

""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.
While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""

After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political
subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):

[Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb
'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

""In reply to your numbered questions:

[Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people.""

[Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""

[Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not
existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed' null and void?""

[Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""

[Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""

[Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""

[Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military.""

[Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200
years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""

[Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a
well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

[Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence,

""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be
infringed.'

""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,

""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;
and

""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation.""

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
any conclusion.""

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.

As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning
arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
guaranteed by the Constitution.

And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

Perhaps you've been under a rock since, say, the turn of the century. How
in the #$^& is one man supposed to review every single freaking
governmental action, every day? That's why we have an executive branch. HE
reviewed the plan and said ""go,"" but he wasn't the architect and he wasn't
there, bullhorn in hand, implementing it. Yes, he was responsible in the
sense that he was briefed. So what! Shit happens. That sounds like a
callous way to dismiss the deaths of 90+ people, but I can't understand why
people get so bent about the accidental death/suicide (which is it? could
take months...) of some total fucking sociopath/child molester and his
crazed followers while opposing U.S. intervention in Bosnia. Just like
Billy boy said. I think some of you people have too much time on your
hands, and screwed up priorities.

[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]

Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day
with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.
It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,
whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from
wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.

Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to
remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been
checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the
people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of
""election fraud"" to hold their jobs.

Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and
sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and
telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too
many cases, who they were).

Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and
discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a
delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater
of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was
being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or
ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.

The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner
Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's
hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive
husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole
our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an
inadequate hearing room.

One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.
He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is
always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied,
""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a
demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the
pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his
mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and
several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors.
(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)

The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were
about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers
from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got
closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A
cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the
crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker
was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.

Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet
saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up
to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills.""

First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to
testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students
had some curfew, I guess).  

Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long
guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of
his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to
non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock
folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed.

Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle.""
The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well
that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,
and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery
corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed
that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was
lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining
states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as""
that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.

Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of
these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!""
(Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if
only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't
be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!)

Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was
there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's
reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's
almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the
ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were
judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the
spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)
He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the
right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(

Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a
CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a
restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining
order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction
-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor
of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,
""I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to
get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have
convicted.""  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous
performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.

Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable
every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated
purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.
""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some
congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that
it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the
vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn
card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the
law-abiding instead of the crook.

The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.
Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining
order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any
bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He 
was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One
of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was
vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in
the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every
year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...""
It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been
more effective.

At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.
Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because
the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was
disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had
to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public""
testimony; the other got a seat this time.

Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the
state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.
He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that
his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great
quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state
computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used
against the renewable FID card.)

Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had
been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he
got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and
said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General
Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how
50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women
needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was
granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether
the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be
satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather
than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long
rambling circumlocution in response.

Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks
something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining
orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue
restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they
think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining
orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.
Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.

Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a
restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she
countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have
allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.
One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be
certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga
reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go
to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating
conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)

Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his
citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver's license was a
privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.

A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice
system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public
hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death
penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public
hangings.  The speaker then responded, ""I'll make you a deal.  You get
me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.""

Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher
testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he
wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was
outside"" without his evil gun.  She said that the ""loophole"" should be
closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again"".

Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of
spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually
shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,
saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are
safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or
correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had
claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  ""Only residents can get
FID's,"" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no
idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut
out-of-staters completely off?)

Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as
written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by
out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could
be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary
somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino
underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident
student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental
record.

One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy
a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist"".  Another
(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents
from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union
had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home
state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this
resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,
""Everyone's out of step but Johnny!""

All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony
for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the
other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and
GOAL's position) were:

o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull 
   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)

o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)

o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly
   opposed)

o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws 
   (opposed)

o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)

o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)

o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)

o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)

o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)

Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining
pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.

Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger
lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee
to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.

Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.
Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,
""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it
could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It
ended at about 6:30.

No firearms were ever ever shot at the National Guard at Kent State.

At the time of the shooting, no rocks were being thrown at all.  The squad was
slowly proceeding up a knoll, away from the body of students.  Some students
were taunting them, and photographs of the incident show at most one or two
students who were following and taunting.

The series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill, while
occasionally their NCO, .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.
All at once, as if on command, the entire squad turned and fired their M1
Garands, firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the NCO can be shown with this
45 at full recoil).  At least two of the students shot had nothing to do with
the taunters... they were only passing through, and were not participants in
the confrontation.

There is some dispute whether the Guard was even legally on Campus... apparently
they had not been invited onto the state school by the president, who had
conveniently flown the coop, so as not to be around.  The governor of Ohio,
James Rhodes, had just embarked on a senate campaign, and wanted it to be known
that he was tough on peaceniks, so had ordered the guard in.

The matter was quickly covered up.  Some years later, wounded survivors launched
a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made, and under the
terms, the plaintiffs could not discuss much, and guilty individuals were not
identified (in fact, those shooters in the squad have been identified).

It was a tragic incident, but it was not provoked by the students, or apparently
by General DelCorso or any of his command.  From studying the incident & the 
photos, IMO it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last 
Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders
ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is
a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay
cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's
paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.
It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)
anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.

By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all
over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower
prices. And their selection is amazing.

Actually, Joe, I wrote the above.  Peter was responding to my article.

I'm actually rather confused by your post.  I suppose I didn't
make myself clear, cause you seem to have gotten exactly the
opposite impression from what I intended.  I suppose ""the authorities""
might have been a better term than ""society"".  Carry and use a firearm
in many parts of the country (certainly the parts I live in), and expect,
at the very least, to have an awful lot of explaining to do.
And there is also appears to be  a trend in society at large that
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.

   In a few other parts of our society, handguns are banned or
   so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law-
   abiding citizen for self-defense outside the home.  Funny, 
   though, how the criminals in such places continue to have a 
   lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.  
   IMHO, you don't need to be either a political philosopher or 
   a crime victim to realize that there's a flaw in the gun-
   grabbers' logic.  

Agreed.

   You're welcome to your HO, too, the First Amendment being as 
   important as the Second, but please don't let your obvious 
   good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities 
   about something as big and diverse as US society.

My only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable
weapons of self defense doesn't mean you'll escape a whole shitload
of trouble should you be forced to use them.

   Or by the
   naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause 
   to someone who would be a criminal anyway.

I made no such statements, nor do I have such a naive hope or outlook.  
   
   Wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself
   if others' thoughts are not that kindly,

That's all I want: the opportunity to leave in peace, or to 
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

I *think* we agree on this issue.  I guess my position didn't
survive the transition from cognition to ASCII.

A really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  It

I understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before
May 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  Is
Texas one of those states?

Can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been

And finally, I think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest
of facts on the Waco incident.  In particular, I would like a source
for the FBI/BATF mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and
information on the beginning of the raid, specifically BATF
lies.

I am also interested in past BATF no-knock warrents which have lead
to personal and property damage against innocent citizens.

I intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.  The author

""Put not your trust in princes"" is the Biblical proverb.  The modern
analog is governments.  At the time of the founding of the US, the
idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not
that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  To a
considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights.

Yes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of 
a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until
quite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as
restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves
does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most
slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.

Freedom of speech and freedom of religion are under real attack NOW.

Actually, the Miller court did nothing of the kind.  It remanded
the case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't
know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon.  (Doesn't it
bother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in
a case where there was no defense?  Miller had been released by
the appeals court and disappeared - only the govt was represented.)

We don't know what would have happened with the reasonable ""all guns
are militia weapons"" argument.

Imagine, you have been under seige for almost two months by an enemy which you
believe wants to kill you.  Suddenly, they pump tear gas into your building and
punch holes in it with tanks.  Then a fire breaks out.  Do you run outside to
be slaughtered, or stay and face your fate.

Check Ethiopia vs. Italy in WWII for some answers to that question.

Seeing as how people are willing to quote the FBI quoting cultists
who just yesterday were deranged and not to be trusted (hmm the FBI
or the cultists...) I think I'll quote the BBC quoting (actually voice
interview) one of the two British survivors. He claimed that the fire

Maybe true, partly true, or false.

Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this
growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the
investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from
any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been
behind it.  What's going on here?

Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.
I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops
because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business
negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR
knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a
psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had
professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was
emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from
civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their
isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious
orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as
the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being
consumed in the apocalypse.

IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated
psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of
action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly
appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the
tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,
obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push
him over the edge.

Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV
earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical
role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno
on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)
claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true
they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they
were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and
reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at
the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and
would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the
""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image
that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back
and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.

Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without
bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency
interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation
of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.

The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,
abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the
armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited
his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A
simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell
how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not
have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the
compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the
FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the
revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without
all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to
show the world how big her balls are.

Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my 
very soul.

Ah, clarification by obfuscation.

Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the
security of a free state"" is a present participle, used as an
adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of
the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It
asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for
maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or
state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other
than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a
right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,
Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.
The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the
amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right

The final word on liberties and rights should not belong ""to the
many"".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of
the majority can ensue from ""popular"" opinion, a concept which you
should be familiar with from the Federalist papers.

excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:

     Although less apparent to those who have not researched
the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as
sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent
research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State
University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns
are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by
criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in
this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when
you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because
of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding
private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study
of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%
of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime
because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,
and  57% agreed that ""most criminals are more worried  about
meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the
police.""2
     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the
women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation
that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in
response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This
should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando
Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female
populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just
the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and
obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for
that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to
experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,
a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes
showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion
rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,
the completion rate drops to 3%.

The Ventura County DA came to the same conclusion in the report he

Jason - I've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as
conspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at
least at the beginning.  There were a lot of bad decisions that went into
this tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive
action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of
those bad decisions.  Actually, the only ones I see that are tied into
a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with
stockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts.

I think there are a lot of us that have been following this pretty closely

the result of stupidity than malice.

No, that's not right either.  People who have both easy access and the
desire to kill, kill people.  Considering that people who have the
desire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (Haven't you folks
learned anything from either Prohibition or the war on drugs?)

If you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to
mention the other costs incurred.

Good for them.  I note that the TM folks make the same argument.  If
you'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city),
they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  At least
they're not promising to jail me if I don't go along with their little

Ah, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it
doesn't work to reduce crime.  What is the point?  We can't claim that
it is symbolic, as people do get jailed.

>The police are

No, they're essentially saying ""we hope this will keep you from

While it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.
Moreover, ""controlled"" doesn't tell you WHO's doing the controllling.

Fletcher's Political Works, pub'd in 1749, defines a ""well-regulated
militia"", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people NOT
under the control of govt.  The wigged gents who argued about the
constituion used it in that way.

Feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than
""individual right, not to be interfered with by govt"".

Note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on
govt military power.  See Scarry's University of Penn law review
article for an extended discussion.  The existence of a well-regulated
militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.

: Go to hell. I'm no ""government [-] following fanatic."" Your sweeping
: generalizations evince your own ignorance. What were they supposed to do?
: Just let him be? 

Yes.  Given the history of the BD's and the fact that they were just 
peacefully minding their own business, I think this would have been
the correct course of action in the very beginning.  Everything that
followed was a direct result of the major media fuck-up that the BATF
perpetrated just over 51 days ago.

:Fuck him. Fuck the ATF, too. They should've done it right
: the first time.

Yep, no doubt about it.  They should have just bombed those kooks
right from the git-go.  Yeah, sure!  So much for any resemblence
to an America that abides by the Constitution.  So much for feeling
safe in your home.  So much for any of the rights enumerated in the
Bill of Rights being upheld.  Why bother?  They just get in the way
of an effective government.  That is, a government of the elite, by
the elite, for the elite.  

Joe, attitudes like yours frighten me.  You have very few facts about
what actually happened, and what information you do have came from a 
single source, the FBI/BATF.  Yet you are more than happy to pronounce
the BD's guilty-as-charged based on this one-sided testimony.  Scary!

	Waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  The population temporarily
   raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers
   arrived.

	I tell you what, I stayed in a hotel room about 4 miles from the BD
   compound around 3 weeks ago.  I have never felt more paranoid in my whole
   life.  There were at least 100 state police in the hotel.

So who brainwashed YOU into believing that whatever the government says it
the truth?  Or that Koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the 
US?  Haven't you ever stopped to wonder WHY the government raided this farm?
This raid was NOT ABOUT RELIGION, SEX, OR CHILD ABUSE.  To the best available
evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was 
about Koresh's failure to PAY A $200 TAX on ONE grenade launcher that he may 
or may not even have had!  That's why it was the BATF doing the raiding in the
first place.

Do you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
with 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise
torture, and a holocaust?

> I am however sad to hear of the death of any

Then think before you post.

On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to
tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If
there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or 
any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the
chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with
respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas 
contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would
peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.
If they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't
be too far fetched.  Throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and
subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.
Anybody tried to get Amnesty International to jump in on this one?

>effect on homicide rates.

I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But
there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to 
consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with 
fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000
(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes
each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find
the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are
homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately
5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides
and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to 
be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures
would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.
That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,
only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since
gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal
sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,
law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on
armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) 
That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.
  
>...There were over 250 >accidental< handgun
>homicides in America in 1990, most with licensed weapons.

Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not
supporting ""reasonable"" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background
checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would 
alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you
are supporting.

By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.
250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to 
other household accidents.

>...More
>American children accidentally shot other children last year (15)
>than all the handgun homicides in Great Britain.

1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from 
drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from
falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental
deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a 
better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to
professionals like plumbers?)

>...Please... no dictionary arguments about RATES vs
>TOTAL NUMBERS, okay?  They're offered for emphasis, not comparison).

While you might call it ""emphasis"", refering to completely two
statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it
isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people
you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.

Our new Attorney General seems determined to do so. In the past
few days she has said:

	She hopes the King beating will not reduce public confidince

	The tactics of using tear gas and driving tanks through
	walls in Waco were intended to further a ""peacefull solution""

	Those same tactics were intended to prevent a mass suicide,

Um, I sortof hesitate to bring this up, but owning even a single share
entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting, and under most
corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed.  While I *don't*
suggest the tactic used by some in Japan (go to the shareholders meeting,

Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse.

The problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill
sounds like a ""good idea"" too, until you discover that there is NO check,
and that the police DON'T have to allow your purchase even if you check
out, and that you have NO recourse if they don't.

Are there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady
Bill, for example.

The more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about
Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern
Congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?

 Firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under.  I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.
What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?
I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

 Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence
or the Centers for Disease Control.  If YOU look carefully you will see
that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that
400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access
to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between
1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the ""statistics"".

 Okay, maybe I worded it wrong...DAD.  I meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a Messiah in my opinion.  I'm not saying that Koresh had control over
these children directly, but I would hope that whatever Messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.
If as he claimed he was the Messiah and people followed him as such, why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive?  Thanks for the reality check Joe, its been real.

I wrote a letter the other day to Empower America - the organization
which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake 
of the Republican defeat last fall. 

Some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.

You'd be close to the truth.

Their two leading spokesmen are Bill Bennett, former 'Drug Czar' who heartily
supported Bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - 
who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and
Jack Kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. 

These are conservatives ? 

Anyway I thought it interesting that when I ran Word Perfect's spell check
against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'Bennett' :

1. Banned
2. Bayonet


Needless to say, I found these choices rather amusing.

   Did I say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent?
 NO.  I hate to repeat myself Jim, but like I told Joe, I was not attempting
in any way to justify gun control.  You're right, any death is serious.
THAT was my point to Joe who said that ""anti-gunners"" try to convinve
the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious
problem.  I guess I assumed everyone thought that it was a problem.
No, I don't want to discuss match control.  I don't equate a book of matches
to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  Don't confuse the issue.  And please don't
say that tired old NRA line ""Guns don't kill people, people kill people"".
Sure, people can kill people without guns.  But easy access to guns makes it

    Jim, I'm just saying how it is.  I'm not saying if that is a good thing
or not. From the police who I have talked with who run some of these gun
buyback programs, I get the impression that they really think they are
having an impact on the community.  When I ask them if they have an evaluatory
component to the program, they say ""well no...""  So, in answer to your
question, no, false hope is not the intent.  I think the intent is to
show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal
gun violence whether its effective or not.  Look, if you can't measure
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test
evaluation, what is the point?  It must be symbolic in nature.  The police are
essentially saying ""look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't
want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community"".
If you, I and Joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.

About 2 months ago Rush was chortling over the fact that Reagan has stumped

If Rush's criticism of Clinton were to be applied to Reagan and North...

Gosh, Rush sure wants to have it both ways... Clinton MUST be held

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has
taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half

We all know this will never happen.  Because the Police are under the wings
of Government, they will always be considered more important than Citizens.

Government pens, pencils and paper are considered more important than
Citizens.

That you know of.

While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and

Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is ""no big deal"" if you are
the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail,
waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put
criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would
drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very
early.

They did not believe, from experience, that the ""police"" (including National

does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What
would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and

I see that I misphrased my question.  I should have asked WHICH
full-autos Kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto
look-alikes.  I should have also included some semi-auto only guns in
my list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their
non-existent full-auto ""relatives"".

Let's do the former now.  Kratz has claimed that he can visually
distinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  For which full-autos is he
making that claim?  How does he do it?  Let's get specific, and as
exhaustive as possible.

Maybe?  Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?

Is Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from
a two position switch via TV inspection?  (Does he even get to see the
switch in the typical police display of guns?)  Note that one might
well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection
even though it won't be seen on TV.  And to think that Kratz was
telling us that seeing it on TV was just as accurate as being
there....

>How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
>semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

Why all the questions?  Kratz assured us that he could make this distinction
and now he's asking us how he did it....

CNN just claimed he bought 104 ""semi-automatic assault rifles"".  And
they say Koresh wasn't god-like...  He managed to buy or build a
collection of fully-automatic semi-automatic rifles...  Quite a feat,
I would say.  ;-)

They're still making charges of ""sexual abuse"" and such, or course.
Nobody seems to have noticed that the Treasury department has nothing
to do with sex crimes.  Or maybe the feds have recently instituted a
TAX on sex crimes...  Yeah, that's why the BATF was there, looking for
unregistered *guns* (""this is my weapon, this is my gun, this is for

I also heard that they're claiming to be cautious because of Koresh's
""heated ammunition stockpile"".  I seem to recall that smokeless powder
tends to decompose at even moderate temperatures.  I would be rather
surprised, after a fire of that nature, if *any* of his ""stockpile"" is
unexploded, or unburned.

I think *anything* is legal if you have the proper license.  If he had

       While I wouldn't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got
to be paranoid based on either Usenet in general or Phill Hallam-Baker's
comments in general, you'd be surprised.
 
       For most people, if you accuse them of something long enough and

       What an amazing thing.  I didn't realize that over a hundred million
gun owners all posted to tpg.
 
       Even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what
you say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written
personas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very
small and select group.
 
       Anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on
Usenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care
about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.
 
>USEnet as a whole
>disproves it of humanity as a whole.
 
        Speaking of which...
 
      Most of the ""readership"" posts I've seen put the most read
newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number I have a feeling is
fairly inflated.  The posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a
very tiny minority of that group.  And the whole of Usenet readers
are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.
 
       If anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative
sample of Usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too
much time available to us.

I have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.

They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal
manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police
have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of
the guns they conficate were illegally built.

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's
time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket
prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten
times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.
resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and
buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs
and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
can not be easily side-stepped.

Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,
you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad
example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal
copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and
it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually
get it illegally.

13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.
Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and
saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but
it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction
in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm)
and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer
could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
reappear on the streets...)

Perhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs 
also tried to invade Slovinia. They were driven out after a few
weeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.
The Afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.

How about a gun buy-back/charity?  Get some sponsors to fund the
purchase of used firearms, have a gunsmith check them over, and give
or sell them at a low price to poor persons wishing to own firearms. ;-)

No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so
the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder.

Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my
reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was 
about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand
primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20
and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the 
reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2"" of char on
the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other
words.

None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.
No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.
The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids
completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was
contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred
badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case
of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.

Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood
on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the
rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were
found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into 
the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually
dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.
The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.
No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets
left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.

Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless
of what the FBI says.

In the latest case in Denver, they were giving away tickets to a Denver

How traceable is a money order?  (I don't know. Haven't used one in 20 years)

Is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?

	As a matter of fact, I know it.

	There were several shootings recently in which the guns had
been purchased at the Baltimore Gunsmith, on Broadway - a favorite
place to get cheap ""popular"" pieces. By ""popular"" I am referring to
the kinds of guns our local youth gangs like: pistol grip shotguns,
cheap magnums, and Tec-9s.

Though David Sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that
talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the
Second Amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out 
of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active 
threads discussing EXACTLY this topic which at least explore the fallacies 
of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.

Basic fact #1, Mr. Sternlight:  The RIGHT described is a ""right of the people
to keep and bear arms;"" not a ""right of the people to form a militia,"" a
""right of a militia to keep and bear arms,"" or a ""right of well-regulated
people to keep and bear arms.""  This should be apparent from a simple
reading of the sentence.

For the other arguments, I suggest you check out the thread, ""Some more

near you.

No, Frank Crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people
are sane, normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. USEnet as a whole
disproves it of humanity as a whole.

We now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer. Buy a lot of
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the FBI to burn
down your house. See even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
to support gun control.

Wait a minute.  The story being pushed here is that the fire started
in ONE PLACE.  This is not consistent with the story that they were
TRAPPED by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).

Well, for everyone besides Koresh and his blood children, we can

an assault which clearly endangered their lives.  Or, alternatively,
they were not permitted to leave.  Choose one.

Please, PAY ATTENTION.
I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed,
(regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a
higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun,
then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point,
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the
weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

Pro-gun people can take used pot-metal guns with sale values LESS THAN

So, you have the right unless the Federal Government says you don't.
I don't think I like this very much.

This would be much better if it said ""everyone except those who have
been striped of this right by due process of law"" or some such thing.

Also, I don't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights
regardless of which state right is being stepped on.  If the constitution
doesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up about
it.

The only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitution
prohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case this
bill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitution
and that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.

I did read the law before I commented on it.  Judging from replies I received
about my ""Semantics on t.p.g"" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g
assume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the
possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said
person would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or
business.

>-andy
>--

Maybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  The thing
that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying
a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their
person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many
people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.
Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above
quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I
am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether
or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that
I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.
Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he
seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.
I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is
useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now
is that Freeman and I are ""running around in circles"" trying to prove each
other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course
now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier
posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky
about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-
times.

Nntp-Posting-Host: scws8.harvard.edu

I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the
pro-RKBA arguments presented here.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a
million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number
of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,
it is surprising that the ""Evil AntiGun Empire "" (Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare
""All legitimate gun defenses"" vs. ""All gun crimes.""  Instead, 
it's always ""All legitimate gun defenses,""  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and
cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just 
criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which
the victim died.

Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred.

       I'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment
process was to require a super-majority to change the Supreme Law,
making it impossible for a ""majority"" of the people to simply change
the law on a whim.  Simply changing the meaning based on ""the
representatives"" of the people effectively destroys the amendment
process.  The State's, you know, are also entitled to a say under
that process.

       I'll note that that right could be considered protected under

I don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is
pretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath.  Of
course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged
things to get away from it.  I've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill

What they didn't mention is that IN THE OPEN, it probably wouldn't do
TOO MUCH harm to children, although I wouldn't use it in close proximity
to infants.  On the other hand, IN CONFINED spaces, the effects are
GREATLY intensified, to the point of LETHALITY, since a sufficient
quantity of CS will displace OXYGEN.  When running a CS chamber CAREFUL
attention is paid to ventilation.  I wonder if they checked to see if
any of the BDs were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory
diseases.  I doubt it.

        Well, if we're going to discuss being a police officer in

This is not borne out of reality; the old Soviet Union had a very

machineshops. Why would all production have to be local; don't we
have a road system that is the envy of the world?

I seem to recall incidents in the past where Chinese entreprenaurs
attempted to smuggle AK-47s (semi-autos) into this country to
get around import number limitations (May have been Gunweek where
I read that years ago...)

Any person with high-school drafting skills and vocational school
machineshop training could produce a submachinegun. You talk about
the average person not being able get even a zip-gun; well now, think
of all that private CNC controlled machinery that is not being used for
3 shifts a day; do you think that if guns were being sold on the
black market for say, $150, an enterprising mechanical engineer
could be using that machinery to produce workable submachineguns
for sale? After all, GUNWEEK had an article and pictures on how BATF
was looking for the manufacturer of quite efficient silencers that
were of commercial quality and finish.

Look at it this way, 25% of the U.S. households have a handgun. Say
at least half of those keep one for self-defense. You are talking a
potential market of of tens of millions of people who would seek
firearms for the purpose of self-preservation. Only a fool would
believe that market would not be filled, regardless of government
prohibitions.

  I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were
talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

  A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not
that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con-
ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person
home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have
my own shotgun in my apartment.

  Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no,
I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying
that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence
that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.

  It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.  
Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this)
to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.

  I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever 
bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons,
and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't
got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. 
If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that
is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per-
verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something
in their state.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would
have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on
homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one
cannot speculate as to the utility of anything.  All they have is a
correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.

Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive
gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in,
would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from
someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one
problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question.
Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to
here.

Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You

purposes other than self-defense, which can also be used for defense.

I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,
in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,""
but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
We'll never know if he would have kept that one.

Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing

It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to ""go state's
evidence,"" parrot the FBI story, hang the whole ""suicide"" on Koresh, 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them
do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong.

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the
various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds
of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm
sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically
(not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal
rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than
willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased
taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that
these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social
responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally
and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the
hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands
solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To
do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in
the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and
politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and
subsequent development and urbanization of these former private
hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any
benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.

On a DA revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  On a pistol where
the trigger does not cock the hammer, like a Jennings, or an Astra M400,
or a Glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to
function.

Rather than a high capacity revolver, think of a Glock as an Astra M400 
with no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.

	I'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six
minutes!  Ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.  It is
not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached
and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber.  Since
that chamber has a door, not just a window, it's likely a hell of a lot
easier to exit than a multi-room, damaged house.

Here goes:

More than a few years back (if you were born that year, you can legally drink),
we tried it out.  We found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft.
2X6s.  We put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans)
stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom.  After lighting the
fire, we LOWERED a box of .38 Spc. SWCs into the can.  We heard pops, one solid
bang and several ""fizzzz shussss"".  After we thought the excitment was over, we
boldly climbed down to find that NONE of the bullets had left the can, several
of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all
died of smoke inhalation.  And 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers!

Killed by handgun, or killed?  If I'm dead, I don't much care if it

I don't think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe England is
compared to Switzerland by concentrating only on handgun murders and  
completely ignoring murders by other weapons, not to mention the rate of
other violent crimes.  If there are more guns in circulation, if follows
that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to
the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they
have to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.  

The gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.  If people
are intent on committing a crime, they will do it with whatever means
are available to them.

I don't think such a Canada is any more ""culturally similar"" to
the United States than England. In terms of laws regarding individual
rights, restrictions on police searches, etc... (all closely
related to crime) Canadian laws parallel England's and differ
greatly from those of the United States.

Actually, they do not have ""roughly the same... urban economy"", 
and extremely different ethnic composition.

However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,
the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are
predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class.
The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,
while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three
times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.
The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not
one of gun control.

That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing
the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their 
attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that
0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every
case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.
(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,
based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000
crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other 
studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.
Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences
involve killing the attacker.) 

So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) 
cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted
in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in
comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides
make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study
considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides
prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be
close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

And you'd be wrong about that too.

Note that Texas isn't unique in this ""more with-gun deaths than
with-car deaths"", but some of the other states where it happens have
extremely strict gun laws.  Oops - so much for the ""meaning"".

It isn't clear that the comparision means anything anyway as car
accidents are unintentional while gun deaths aren't, but if we're
going to make it, let's at least be honest.

Give it up for what?  Gun control doesn't have any benefits, so
it fails by this standard.

Note that insurance gives me something in return - gun control doesn't.

That's half the question - the rest is ""and what do you get for your
sacrifice"".  If the answer to the second question is ""nothing"", as it
is for gun control, then we don't have to ask the first question
because getting nothing means that no sacrifice is justified.

Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  
I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed 
today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found

Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian 
in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, 
will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long 
news story about that documentary.

Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I 
were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change 
my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the ""distrustful ones"".

Gun clubs:
If you are a member you CAN borrow weapons....(Suprised??)
You are supposed to train with a .22 for the 6 months, THEN
you can start with anything bigger.

Drivers licence:
Forgot that USA is THE land of cars.....
Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy.
Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather......
But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and
bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS.
(If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)

Abuse by the goverment:
This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control
would just be abused by the goverment.(!)
Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should
get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)

Guns 'n Criminals:
MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.
Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.
And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),
we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.

Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!
Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to...
I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)

The issue (I hope..):
I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.
Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)

I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:
They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them
to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.

If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
it's the 'axer' ??
(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)

Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works
(in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...
(Something about throwing stones in glass houses...)
Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.
(Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (YES!)

(My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot-guns are from the police
and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa) (understood that one Sorenson??)

LAST WORD:
Responsible gun owners are not a problem, but they will be affected if you want to protect 
your citicens.

Two notes of interest from Texas:

The Tarrant Couonty ME (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering
judgements that are contrary to the police view.  He presented evidence a few
years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had
his hands in the air.  This does not bode well for the boys in black.

The Texas Dept. of Public Saftey and the Texas Rangers have no great love for
the ATF.  I have heard them referred to as ""those fucking cowboys"".  The DPS
was totally squeezed out of the BD operation and resented being left as
""traffic cops"".  ATF now has two strikes against them.

Finally (I guess that makes three notes), rumour from Waco is that four ATF
agents were stopped by four Waco police cars and a DPS trooper after one of the
flashed ""an automatic weapon"" at a cop.  Lots of pissed of cops.  And you
wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the ATF.

	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck

work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this.

	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from

a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one""
than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of
the word ""intimidation"" and you can see where intimidation is not

	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because
everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To
draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in
NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires
no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence
Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having
motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the
EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in
telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note
that our own state governments often play with game with the federal
government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.

>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.

	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to
remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we
have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the
police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals
in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.

This is really uncalled for.

You cannot expect a European, growing up in a culture of ""rulers"" and

and citizen sovereignity in the US.

He's less at fault than the countrymen we have here who also can't grasp it.

The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being
a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this
area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that
people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like
that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.

I agree.      If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you
most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.

Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.  You started 
from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of
insanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  Recall, one
survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene 
lamp.  Kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no?

""Nice evasive maneuver, Mr. Chekov, but they're still on our tail.""

Let me ask it more plainly.  Which of the above complaints about David 
Koresh's religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms?

It's not entirely far-fetched.  Nobody outside the compound would know 
EVERYBODY inside the compound.  Don't forget, the BATF admits having 
agents inside the compound, in any case.

I'm simply being the devil's advocate.  There's reasonable doubt by the
boatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official

After seeing William Sessions on television, explaining the great lengths
to which the FBI went to determine the suicidal tendancies of David Koresh, 
I got the very unpleasent feeling that Koresh had manipulated the FBI's

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens.  Just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. The
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

Subject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 5.
Nntp-Posting-Host: gozer
Organization: SigSauer Fan Club 
Lines: 94

Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.

Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that
Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National
Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge
asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because
of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.

The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently
ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither
by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.

The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,
who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person
named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as
an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
in his dealings with Randy Weaver.

Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an
Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two
then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in
time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons
transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he
(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the
White cause.""

The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and
later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second
meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to
tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-
gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of
19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge
shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of
24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel
length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver
is reported to have said that he could perform better work once
his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility
of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars
for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty
dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have
simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -
over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).

The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that
his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead
of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver
suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in
Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince
Weaver otherwise.

The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were
made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these
meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also
reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki
Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must
have also been phone taps.

These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and
loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's
attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to
make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a
case at all..."" according to the rules.

Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his
wife's voice on the tape.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear
accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the
Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect
this trial is not explained.

Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning
Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are
surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were
surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained
in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy
Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that
Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report
that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming
at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics
are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the
only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and
Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that
Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.

Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. 
Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.

       The relevance is that if you've got x homicides and reduce

       ""Anyone trained in self-defense."" 

       Unarmed self-defense isn't for everyone.  What's more, it requires
substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm.
It requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim,
which is a primary problem with stun guns.  You have to actually touch
your assailant.  Unless you're *very* good, a large, stronger assailant
can simply ignore your blows long enough to incapacitate you.

I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....


Overall Crime rate:
It fell....just like that...

Acquiring weapons in Norway:
You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a 
permit, and a good reason to get the permit....
If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from 
the police and to be a member of a gun-club.
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
records of SERIOUS mental diseases.
Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun
-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'
for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short 
time befor the crime.

Use of knives:
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.
You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open
in public -rigth ??

Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':
We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide
to take action we DO.
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....
(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

Individual vs masses:
Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
extent....
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others ??


The issue:
I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.
We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
But should it have to be like that ??
Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??
If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns ??

Disclaim-her:
I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. 
I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as
neccities or toys.
I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't
want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....

Feel free to use any and all of these questions that strike your

       you would resign and never run for office again?
       
   2.  Under what circumstances do the rights of the group come
       before the rights of the individual?
       
   3.  Would you support a city charter amendment prohibiting the
       city government, its officials, agents, and employees from
       initiating force against any human being for any reason?
       
   4.  Please put the following list in order of precedence (from
       lowest to highest): a) city ordinance, b) city resolution, 
       c) state law, d) federal statute, e) U.S. Constitution, 
       f) state constitution.
       
   5.  Do you believe that it's appropriate for any city official or
       employee to be paid more than his or her average private
       sector constituent?
       
   6.  Do you believe that involuntary contributions are a legitimate
       means of funding council programs?
       
   7.  Would you support a program recognizing the right of
       taxpayers to ""earmark"" their taxes (either as ""must be used""
       or ""must not be used"") for specific programs?
       
   8.  In the event that the candidate ""None of the Above"" were to
       win a city election, which option do you believe most
       appropriate? a) The candidate with the next highest vote total
       fills the office. b) A special election is held to fill the 
       office, with none of the previous candidates eligible to run 
       again. c) Let the office remain unfilled and unfunded until 
       the next election. d) Abolish the office.
       
Please return your questionnaire to: [address of your choice]

A signature and date line were added here.
    
Thank you for taking the time to fill out this questionnaire.

                                 ******

The questionnaires were sent with self-addressed, stamped envelopes.

P.S. One person _did_ get a perfect score on the questionnaire, and,

If this were not true in practice, then certain unethical politicians would
not be passing gun control laws.  Politicians are generally whores to public
opinion.  This does NOT mean the the public is either well informed or correct.
As for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.  The

Used to own firearms? While armed insurrection, as the FF's of the Const. 
may have envisioned seems to me a somewhat fanatical approach to avoiding this,
Political protest is still an option at this point.  I agree that it's 
argueably not enough and/or too late.  If all else fails, there's always
PVC pipe and cosmoline.

 Here, you are somewhat in error.....in ALL respects we are paying. When we
 are not paying for their countryclub incarceration, we are paying with our
 lives and belongings as their prey. Upon what would they practice their
 nefarious predatory acts if not for the citizens of this country. What is
 amazing to me is the mindset of those who overtly and covertly perpetuate
 a justice system (har) that essentially mandates that some of us offer up
 ourselves as that prey while they suitably insulate themselves from the

Any death is serious.  Wanna discuss match control?  Firearms related

This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical
coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
national system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured
must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital,
you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills. 
In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them, 
you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do
so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within
24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need
your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly
wouldn't know they had to.) Therefore, you are required to carry
the card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage.

Not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  Any generators are
no doubt out of fuel, too.  So all they would have is wood stoves and
kerosene lanters (maybe).  It is alleged that the tanks pushing in the
walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.  Remember, the FBI
had bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private
conversations with the lawyers.  If a suicide order were given they
WOULD HAVE KNOWN IT IN TIME.  If the Feds had been concerned they would
have had emergency equipment ready.  Not an hour or so later, not
leaving the water THEY TURNED OFF, off.  They could have turned it back
on.  They just didn't wanna.  Scores to settle...

The following is quoted from the tail end of a (rather condescending)
article about Paxton Quigley, that appeared in US Snooze and World Lies,
(sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...)
and was repeated in the Colorado (people's) Daily, a student newspaper
at the University of Colorado at Boulder.

""A study of residential gunsot deaths in King County, Wash., found that
a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.  Studies by the 
Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.""

I have seen these numbers quoted before, and I have seen very specific
refutation of them quoted as well.  If someone will be so kind as to
email the relevant information, I will write a letter to the editor of
the Co. Daily (which might get published) and send a copy to USN&WR as
well.

Thanx...

	I think you have weapons on the brain. I never said that these
	alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.
	Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every
	person is armed to the teeth. It is because of (1) attitude
	and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents
	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
	strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups
	like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative
	effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the
	good neighbors step up and say ""THAT'S the one officer ! He
	was robbing Mr. Jones' house"". 

	In short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at
	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.

Fact:  Both Janet Reno and Bill Clinton have admitted responsibility,
       even grief, over the deaths in Waco.

Fact:  Regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough
       things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.
       Cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)
       come to mind.  

Fact:  It is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of
       law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty
       of life in prison.

Fact:  Impeachment is allowable for ""high crimes and misdemeanors.""
       Anything that's a federal felony should qualify.

Conclusion:  We have NO CHOICE, if we are an honest people, but to 
             impeach Mr. Clinton, and remove Reno from office.

No, it is not.  It is possible the FBI planned for this to happen, and the  
gunfire heard was the FBI keeping the folks inside.  I'm not proposing this as  
the way it went down, but just to point out that it's not ""undeniable"" that if  
they walked out yesterday, they would be alive today.

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and
the type of gun being studied.

Some cites:

---------------------------------------

A recent BATF study (titled ""Protecting America, Yes"") surveyed 471 career 
criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were
purchased from retail dealers.

                              by James D. Wright

(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.

Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
licensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --
obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving
friends and associates, family members, and various black market
outlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources
included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and
often theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY
                             By David B. Kopel

     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.
The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
criminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.

51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal
Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of
20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;
of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who
committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)
(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony
convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to
Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony
records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or
non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).

                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel

     Testimony before Congress revealed that most ""assault weapons"" in the
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony
is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings
based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by
sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The
figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the
criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents
of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and
probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of
guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
directly target the black market in criminal guns, and
leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright
believes that the consequences of current ""assault weapon"" legislation on
street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
business.{100}

Kratz comments above show otherwise.

Bingo - now the question is, does the Glock's qualify?  Let's see

But first an aside.  Having an air gun proves nothing.  Moreover,
my comments are based on what Kratz writes.  He's free to argue that
he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.

Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way,
so it can't be ""harder than revolvers"".

>Every article that I have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.

Sure they can.  (Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is
unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically
""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third
generation.""  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't
claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are
dangerous, we see that the argument fails.

>me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or

Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.

>rec.guns articles laying around.  Boy, you can't make a simple statement on

One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone
""getting right on your ass"".  One merely has to make accurate simple
statements.  Then you get ""attaboy""s by mail and publically.

Accuracy is a severe burden, but most of us manage it.

	Very narrow.  Very, very narrow.  If you'll recall, I was the

weapons in certain situations.  How can you possibly define what is a
weapon and what isn't is only the start of this.

	And you've just described any civilian reactor because your
definition fails to note what energy is being considered.  Reactors
blow with a steam explosion, but the majority of energy still comes
from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant.  See
what a can of worms this is?  Last I heard, Ft. Calhoun station just
north of Omaha, Nebraska wasn't considered a weapon.  Given the
sodium-cooled breeder designs on the blocks now, I can easily envision
reactors being household appliances in under twenty years.  With the
PRISM design, there is *no* operator input needed on the reactor
itself, and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can
be made equally as automatic in the future.  So your definition is
flawed in a few respects already.

	Typhoid Mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed.  If
you don't mind extrapolation, any HIV-positive person also fits this
bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of
spreading the virus.  Finally, that manure pile I mention below fits
this definition, as does, say, releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.

	And I can show where any such gas has other uses.  For example,
perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers.  Calcium Carbide
is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas.  It can

making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing.  Toss some in a
toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you'll see that
it can also be a weapon, just like any other flammable substance.
So, now my miners lamps won't work, I can't do any welding, and I
still have those pesky gophers.

	It meets all the criterion of a weapon.  It is an instrument that
can be used for fighting, even though that is not its intended purpose,
and despite there being better weapons around.  Given that the aquifers
supply a significant part of the country with drinking water, mass
destruction is rather a given.

	It's not that certain weapons aren't something I'd rather not
see a lot of people having.  The problem is that it is nearly
impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some
pretext or another.  The looser your definition, the more ripe for
abuse that law is.  Furthermore, if you get specific then the old
standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to
be added to, generally without going through the hassles of another
vote and public reading of the law.  Again, ripe for abuse.

Ah, that British sense of humor.  Probably got a real gut-buster going

Ah, Canada.  Where the criminals don't bother with checking to see
if the victims are home.  They just break on in.  America's a little
different, you see.  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot,
so they more frequently check to see if anyone's home.

Walpole man, 32, guilty in rape

Kenne, N.H. -- A Walpole man
charged with kidnapping a
mother of two from her home, then
raping and beating her, has pleaded 
guilty.  Roger Santaw Jr. also plead-
ed guilty to an attempted escape
from Cheshire County jail last win-
ter.  Santaw, 32 is scheduled to be
sentenced next week.  The rape last
fall came six months after Santaw
was released from prision, where
he spent 15 years for a rape he commit-
ted when he was 16.  (AP)

Any reactions?  Did he do enough time?  What should his penalty
be?  

BTW, Walpole is a town in Massachusetts.  Of course, New
hampshire is close by.

Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the
Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson
in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to
3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).

A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.

- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
  the trigger again.
- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,
  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.
- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
  to rotate to the next round.
- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an
  easy motion, even one handed.
- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.

- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell
  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often
  lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything
  about clearing it.
- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the 
  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider
  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed
  of employment as a revolver.
- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of
  operation of many of them requires more training.

Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having
accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR.

Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter
and pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk""
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot.

Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a 
wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.
Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.
I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit
what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5.

What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple
.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police 
prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....

ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they 
        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking
        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.

You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be
depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned
thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just
about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is
functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working
correctly is totally drop safe.

Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single
documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because
he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few
documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't
figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the
proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely
prevented the office from getting shot.

The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.
This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down
intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a
'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the
standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.
By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.
From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a
revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of
firing it.

The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that
the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the
wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be
familiar with that particular type of firearm.

Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the
joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"".
This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated
or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.
This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time
will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.
That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press
portrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of those
people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the 
gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the
2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk 
voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.
  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the 
official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to
public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.
So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their
advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they
were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification
what so ever of doing what they did.
   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,
may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.

Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton
leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's
(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be
unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).
And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved
in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to 
find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.
It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).

However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about
anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for
carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,
who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun
police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).

Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-
100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable
automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto
handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.

I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make
on the order of at least $40K/year. 

Your presumption of ""disadvantage"" I think is not borne out by the
experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out
on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.

I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers
carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others
have seen Browning Hi-Powers...

First the FBI said they saw two members of the cult start the fire-and the 
FBI never lies.  Second, the first started in opposite ends of the compound 
at the same time and thirdly, the fire spread too quickly for it not to be

As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above
measures are required for you *on your own property*.  You do not have to
have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and
you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own
and operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make use
of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas
you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary
civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.

So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or
*manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing
all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second
Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good
anywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.

jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:

   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not
   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be
   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill
   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.
   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but
   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun
   - and would pay through the nose for it.

Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,
homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate
fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall
the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for
use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of
effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of
killing German soldiers for their guns.

Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was
specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.
The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel
tubing, hand tools and a welder.

I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference
between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown
locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I
think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling
economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the
result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have
firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way
or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.

Summary: FBI did call for firetrucks immediately; experts say 3 fire sources
Organization: Chinet - Public Access UNIX
Distribution: na
Lines: 38


Well, the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the 
compound has been answered. ABC aired a report including the 911 tapes 
from Monday. The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire's breakout. 
Unfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits 
required approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally 
out to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local 
community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By 
the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame 
and it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers 
and no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, 
but the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not 
have one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen's lives in the 
line of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient 
equipment and water to make a difference.

They even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia 
asking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably 
irresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local 
calls could get through.

ABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who 
viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the 
standard ""pool shot""), and agreed that the fire a) must have been 
started in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant 
to spread so fast.

Neither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed 
themselves more than the FBI offed them, but it's a heck of a lot 
stronger proof than some of the ""theories"" floating around the net.

Score 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians. Or is that -89 Branch Davidians?

I'm getting tired of these wimpy Liberals whining about gun control,
too!  Ya know, the Second Amendment says

	A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
	free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms,
	shall not be infringed.

Now, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.

The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate
possessor of nuclear weapons.  Unconstitutional!  You and I have just
as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as
any cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.

Support your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.  It's
a legitimate and challenging sport.

And screw the limit.

Ok, here goes.  Yes folks, I realize I have stuck my foot in my mouth
quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications.  My
inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge.  Thanks
to you kind (and some not so kind) people I am learning.   Some people
have given me several good points to ponder and I see how I was wrong.
In no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to
further the anti-gun cause.  I have said several times before (but
nobody seemed to be listening) that I am pro-gun and anti-gun-control.

As far as the race can of worms that I have opened up I have only one
thing to say - I am in no way prejudiced.  Some of the things I have
stated were said to demonstrate that I am not prejudiced and/or a racist
but I have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced.  I will not
say anymore about that subject because no matter what I say it will be the
wrong thing.

Boy, what a start to being on a new group.  Oh well, things have been

I hope this clears things up but I guess that will remain to be seen.

    Actually all the liberals I've seen have deplored the burning of 
children. I would far preferred that the Davidians had not set the 
fire that burned themselves and their children to death, but I don't 
believe that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete

      I can understand the first screwed-up raid by the BATF.  They
underestimated the opposition, which happens.  But not this one.  
The FBI had their first team in place, massive resources, ample time 
for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.  
They still botched it.

      The FBI Director and the FBI SAC in overall charge should resign,
or be fired for incompetence.

      I don't blame Reno or Clinton.  They gave the FBI clear orders:
don't go in unless you can do it without casualties; if you can't do that,
wait it out.  Those were reasonable orders.  The FBI said they could
pull off a tactical solution, and they couldn't.

There are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any 
constitutational issue :

   (a) Original intent
   (b) Subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day.

If we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution, 
it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen 
be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day.

For references, I cite :

  - Federalist papers
  
  - ""The Embarassing Second Ammendment"", Yale Law Review, 
    Prof. Stanford Levinson [sorry, I don't have the date handy]

       Prof Levinson sought to prove that the 2nd ammendment did not
       convey an individual right, but concluded that it did, hence the 
       ""embarassing"" in his title.
 
  - Report of the Subcomittee on the Consititution, United States Sendate,
    97th Congress, Second Session February 1982.

  - U.S. vs. Verguido Urguidez (Supreme court case in recent years).  
    Although this case did not pertain to firearms, Justice Rhenquist
    notes that the term ""the people"" is a term of art conveying individual
    rights, and specifically cited several used, 2nd ammentment included,
    in his opinion.

  - Title 10, U.S. Code.  This states that all males between the ages of
    18 & 45 not part of the organized militia, and all female officers of
    the national guard are part of the unorganized militia.

Feel free to cite any scholarly and historical references you have to
support your position.  I could go on a greater length with my personal
proof by assertion, however, such a technique would carry no more or
less weight that your dubious proofs by assertion.

Also, you need to consider our legal system.  Since any of these things
CAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied 
lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethal
force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch.  
If you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using 
the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on.  It might actually
IMPROVE the legal outcome.

This is why hollow points hold up in court.  They are safer for you, safer
for innocent by standers, (don't as a rule go through the perp) and actually
safer for the perp.  If you are using military hard ball, you may have to 
shoot him 'MANY' times, where one or two hollow points might stop him and 
do the job.  As a rule, the fewer wound channels, the better the chance 
for his surviving the incident.

Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.

When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had:

 - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
 - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
   by civilians).
 - breech-loading rifles

In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.

Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi, semi- or full-auto?

>Just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.

Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
no reason it should go away.

This is the wrong way to quantify things.  The smuggler would

       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant

       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of
RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is
that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.
It discriminates against the poor.

       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what
conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection
if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened.)

>The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
>records of SERIOUS mental diseases.

       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among
gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals
contain a sort of ""gotcha"" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even
if you qualify in every way.

>-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
>It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
>You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general
a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its
European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. 

       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different
things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary
to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,
which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get
past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public
property, but in restricting activity on private property.

        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have
a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in Europe to another).

        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow
concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can
be either a state or local restriciton.

>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some

>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of

       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual
affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually
get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within
this group, here defined as ""people who own guns,"") are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group.  

       If for instance, ""Bob"" were using his gun to attack ""Steve,"" you'd
have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group ""people who own
guns"" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's
rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one.

>The issue:
>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.

       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.

>We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.

       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.
But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.

>Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??

       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state
may enforce it's ""wisdom"" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise
concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be
""unwise"" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.
   
>If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
>it should be free to buy guns ??

       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently
implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of
drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.

Drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same
direction.  Pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge
from miles around.  Throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will
depart.

Natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
actual conspiracy is required.

Put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he
quickly covers his ass.

This, too, is completely natural.

> About Waco

It looks that way to me, too.  But you have to understand that it's NOT 
the first time they have instigated raids like these.  The most recent
one ALSO ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public
as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  Maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner.  But probably not.

I seem to recall graphic news file of buddhist monks setting themselves on fire
in the streets of Saigon. Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not
so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to 
carry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of 
the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had
less constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the fire
was raging, executed those two, and ran out again.

No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't
lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.

>he stands a better chance of surviving an attack with a baseball bat...

Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim 
in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually
_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)
It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a
knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more
common. That's why it is important to look at the overall
(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of
substitution, different criminal techinques of using different
weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.

>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife
>than a gun, thanks.  

""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't
too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts
to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your
pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife.

>another knife.  Anyone trained in unarmed self-defense won't have

Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in
unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman 
without much problem.

You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime
Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a
knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,
using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)
a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless
of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective
than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""
nearly as often as they do guns.

If I recall correctly, the bill would provide for concealed carry if
the person takes a 15-hr DPS safety course in firearms and pays a $150
fee for the license.  The bill is apparently veto-proof in the House,
but LtGov Bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the
Senate and Dreamboat Annie has vowed to veto it if it comes to her
desk.  *shrug*

Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those
'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily
redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.

Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though.

True, but this is a training function.

Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for
example are quite safe to carry this way.

Agreed.

Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On
the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high
primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.
An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.

I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from
turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.

Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely
to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.
The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category.

Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's ""The Semi
Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.""

In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm.

Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department
isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their
own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.

For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day
and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!

That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a
Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok
too!)

If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)

In some South American countries, after political undesirables disappeared,
the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal
of the body.  You apparently think that would be a good idea.

The Federal Government initiated this action against Koresh and his
followers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological
warfare, used heavy military equipment against US citizens on
US soil; and now that the compound caught fire while they were
pumping in CS gas after knocking holes in the building; disavows
all responsibility.  Big Brother is NOT always right.

You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make

Say U.S.C. 922 :

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for
any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.

 Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a ""person"" 
might also be an artificial entity that is created by government 
and has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I 
don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on 
an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell
me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law 
does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional
until it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not
just your run of the mill ""Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail""

Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told
by the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right?

You seem to make two points.  No one ultimately oversees the federal agencies  
you mention, and since Koresh ""apparently"" has a different view point from your  
Baptist upbringing, then he is not worthy of protection from religious  
persecution.  As to being the Messiah, is not Christ within us all?

Must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

Baptists are a cult, two, BTW, under most of the definitions in the dictionary  
of ""cult"".

I'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against
the Davidians by the FBI/BATF. Here is what I've got so far. Care to add
any or provide more backup info?

First Amendment:
1) FBI/BATF violated Davidians right to free exercise of religion from the 
	start. We now have a de facto precident against any minority religion.
2) FBI/BATF violated BD right to free speach by:
	a> preventing them to speak to media
	b> preventing them from practicing their beliefs
3) FBI/BATF violated the freedom of the press by:
	a> keeping them 2 miles from the Davidians
	b> preventing the media to cover the FBI/BATF actions close-up
	c> censoring media reports
4) FBI/BATF violated the BD's right to peaceable assemble
	a> proven by initial baseless assault

Second Amendment:
1) The BATF went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the
	FBI/BATF didn't approve of. 'Nuff Said.

Fourth Amendment:
1) The right of the BD's to be ""secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
   effects against unreasonable searches and seizures"" was violated by:
	a> Initial baseless assault

Fifth Amendment:
1) The Davidians were ""held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
   crime"" without a ""presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury.""
2) The Davidians were ""deprived of life, liberty, and property without due 
   process of law.

Sixth Amendment:
1) The accused were denied the right to ""a speedy and public trial by an
   impartial jury"" when the FBI became judge, jury and executioner.
2) The BD's were never informed of the specific ""nature anad cause of the
   accusation.""

Eighth Amendment:
1) The Davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when:
	a> The FBI cut off the water to the ranch
	b> The FBI used Psy-War (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of
	   dying rabbits and Tibetian Chants)
	c> The FBI prevented family members from contacting their family
	   inside the ranch.
	d> The FBI used tear-gas against them (especially the children)
	e> The FBI burned the ranch down.
	f> Thoes who escaped were imprisoned without bail without a hearing.

Anything I miss?

I believe that this is not quite correct. My understanding is that LDS is
engaged on a project to ""convert"" the souls of deceased persons of other
religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into
heaven. To this end, the Church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so
that they will know the names of people to convert. A long article in the New
Yorker a few years ago described the LDS research methods in some detail (for
example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the
names of people long dead). This sounds like just the sort of lie that would be
made up about any unusual religion, but the New Yorker story convinced me that
there is some truth to it (the New Yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and
the story was quite detailed).

When will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't
primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties
in the wild?  Granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style
weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door.
When ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot
all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their
ability'.  It will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you
listed above.

Please read the Federalist papers for all clarification on RKBA.  These
documents have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have
had.

For those who didn't figure it out, the below message was a reply to another
in sci.crypt, for which the poster put t.p.g. in the Followup-To line. I
didn't notice that. Apologies to those who were confused.

The substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.

However, I don't wish to enter into this discussion here, as it will be yet
another rehearsal of a long-tired set of arguments. Suffice it to say that I
disagree both with the interpretation of ""well-regulated"" in the Second
Amendment offered by gun lovers, and what I think to be their distortion of
the same phrase in the associated Federalist papers. My Webster and my
reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control,
and disciplined, and not 'of good marksmanship'. I think the latter a
special interest pleading. No one has yet shown a contemporateous reference
in which ""well regulated"" unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship', and
not under control/disciplined, etc.

Thus I continue to believe the Second Amendment is a militia clause and not
an 'arming everyone' clause. Others are welcome to disagree (as I know many
do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular
forum.

To avoid flames, or unproductive rehashings, I note that I've come in here
to post this one message, just to clarify the one below. I'm now outta here
again though I'm available via e-mail.

Medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for

Thus making it as secure as cash, for some purposes, but far less

Sure they do.  The prospective sitter may have a nasty habit of molesting
kids three or four months into the job.  The references may not have
known him long enough or may not have picked up on this yet.

Remember, criminal conviction info is public, so if you're going to
argue for an ID card, other people are going to have a strong argument
that it disclose public info.

Thus making it useless for negative information.

Yeah right.  How are you going to keep doctors from spilling the

info, but at least that info is typically supposed to be public
anyway.)

The article discusses technology, not appropriate policy.  It also

Of course not. There's more than a little difference between formulating
foreign policy and overseeing the ATF's handling of a scenario involving a
group of religious fanatics. Why do people compare apples and oranges?

Hey, guys.  You're absolutely correct, and well on the way to winning
this battle ... and losing the war.  Yes, there are serious philosophical
flaws in HR 1276.  Technical ones, too -- how'd you like to sue the Feds,
lose, and have to pay _their_ ""reasonable Attorney's fee"" ... ?    :-)

Still, I have one basic question:  compared to what we've _got_ is HR 1276
(a) better, or (b) worse?  This one shouldn't even take you three guesses.

If there's a good enough show of support for HR 1276, maybe for a change
_we_ could be the ones saying ""it's a reasonable first step"" ...

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given
about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)
and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could 
synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population
of several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for
the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The
only thing is the expense.  

Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any
law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any
law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to 
add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the
case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that
someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  

Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US
and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as
GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and 
it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture
without anyone knowing about it.

I have already called senators, legislators and the Governor demanding

I seriously doubt, however, that anything will ever be done.

------------------------- Original Article -------------------------

The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article
on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal
tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.
type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,
and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.
The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student
(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...

(The title was the only thing they changed/added)

""Gun Stats""

The Daily recently reprinted an article from the
Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton
Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,
in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The
article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This
is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-
eral reasons, outlined below:

The study gives the impression that, if you own a
gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you.  The study, however, fails to take into
account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun
to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-
trator.

The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every
month, the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a
friend.

The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample
size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-
stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.

Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-
erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be
used, successfully, by a private citizen against an
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.
Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-
rate conclusion from them.

For goodness sake if they had fired a cruise missile at the compound more
people would have come out alive. It was obvious to anyone with the remotest

Are you aware you can make a grenade with gunpower and metal water pipes?
Maybe we should outlaw hardware stores and ammo reloading.

	No, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else
devise a system to get it from other sources.  BTW: the DOE handles
reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  The NRC certifies these
reactors.  The military have their own sources.  A private citizen has
none of these official sources.

	That's freshman-level chemistry.  Big deal.  Can you make it
work?  That's PhD-level physics.  Big difference.

	So you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  Physics
aside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  The answer
is yes.  So, do we lock you up now because of this?  Surely you can
see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?

>Of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material

	Precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have
been lead to believe.  BTW: 98% U235 is far better for home-made bombs
than trying to use plutonium.  The laws of physics make the creation of
a device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.

Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the
last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though
I haven't seen any Glock's). 

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual
rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two
cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a 
large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to
semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand
him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is
very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something 
like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that
""different is good"".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in 
more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a
certain ""propriatory nature"" of each gun that takes some familiarity to 
learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar
with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least
slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.

Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either
pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi
auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.

|>   to rotate to the next round.

I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA
semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same
round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will
always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud
but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will
now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide
on a misfire takes very little time.

Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not
necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and
at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the
round to set it off.

The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed
loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two
handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that
while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the
gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always 
take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing
a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can
still be used if needed later).

Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear
it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire
with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto
but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).

All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any
safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should
say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's
no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing
pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage
carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed
of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm
not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was
initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining
the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and 
shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in
a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets
you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.

Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver
for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all
your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger
far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that
nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and
relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew
off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.

I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry
weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to
r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the
shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the
fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is
a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.

9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still
lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the
street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry
the ""Highway Patrolman"".

Vincent, please don't take any of this as a flame.  Just my $0.02 (whoops, looks more

On TV news this morning it was reported that the local Texas authorities
who have reviewed the cases of the 21 children who were released
earlier in the siege have found no evidence of physical or sexual
abuse of any of the children.  I don't recall if this was on Good
Morning America or our local Texas TV station.

This would have to be a call.  You are not required to say anything until you
have a lawyer present, and not saying anything until such time is not to be
construed as derogatory to your cause.  Anything you DO say can later be used
against you.  You will be talking to the police, the same people who will be

Here is a press release from the White House.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President 
Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:

1:36 P.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day
standoff ensued.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably
insane.

     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on
an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even
in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I
discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I
thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what
she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been
dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the American people.

     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney
General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,
after 51 days, you decided --

     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation
with --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go
first and then the other.

     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I
can't do it at once.

     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she
described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

     I was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
There were no shots coming back from the government side.

     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I
asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons
I was given were the following:

     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be
needed in other parts of the country.

     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

     Number three, that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with
the passage of time.

     And number four, that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

     The third question I asked was, has the military been
consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,
that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military
people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the
military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they
had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military
-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she
should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that
today.

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.

     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --
reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only
reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people
speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General
on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry
King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised
would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves.  (Applause.)

     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were
heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,
and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate
themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the
children.

     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,
is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you
to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she
said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly
unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier
with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for
that.  So that is where I think things stand.

     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of
patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really
decide that way?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume
is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the
World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we
should have known?  Is there some other question they should have
asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say
for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want
the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but
totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it
again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,
particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
February 28th until yesterday?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all
along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go
back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good
job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of
the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the
authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened
yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they
wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
That's what they thought.

     Q  Did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks?

     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are
you in agreement with that?

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do
whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any
congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully
cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the
most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country.

Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there
being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct
me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an ""off"" position or an ""on"" position
because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position
for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is
correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course
if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that
easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16.
How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

Well, what about what I said above?  If that is correct I guess TV would be

I don't know what Traders is claiming, but it appears to me that
the Oakland Tribune has censored gun ads in the past.  Likewise
for the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gun
ad in the San Francisco Examiner.

Specifically, about a year ago on Thursdays, when Traders placed
its ads, the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representing
any handgun sale, though text could list it.  The Trib. would
run a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Traders
ad at all.

Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noise
about measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Traders
ad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, then
stopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago it
has not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludes
a Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take their
ads.

Yes, the usual Chron. Thursday ad was there today, with graphics
representing rifles, safes, etc. as usual.

All very true.  I'm going on what I have read and heard from friends.
Basically the Glock is great but I have heard/read that it is a lot harder to
learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  I was
looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
more ""safe""  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course
this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You
would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I
like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool
(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as
my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with
a ""traditional"" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.

Consider this: The BDs had more than one lamp; The tanks made more than
one hole in the building. Did anyone else notice on the video that it
appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building, there
was a tank nearby?

The fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not

You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people 
have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.

And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you 
can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the 
FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.
You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this 
compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless 
to me.

I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't 
stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me 
sad and sick.

Have you ever heard of Jonestown?
The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority 
worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these 
people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot 
more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as 
last year.

Hmm... all reports from Texas authorities indicate that none of the children
which the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same
results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations,
I can pretty much state that I strongly suspect the government of disinformation
/deception on this issue.  And about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized
religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even
maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds 
for an armed assault?  And from the dollar value of the weapons purchased, 
if they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun, rifle, and
shotgun for each adult, with a few extras...  Going by that rule, the BATF
best get ready for the fight of their life when they assault Alabama...

       The Brady Bill passed the House in 1992, but failed to reach a
vote in the Senate.  As such, it never reached Bush.  (Sarah Brady's
condemnation not-withstanding).
 
       It'll probably pass the House again, and will probably pass the
Senate if they can get it to a vote.  Whether of not they'll be busy
with other things will be the question.  I don't expect gung-ho opposition
on the part of Senate Republicans, since they won't want to over-use their
fillibuster trump card.

I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if
a bunch of people say it is?  For instance, if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad?  This is an
example of mob rule not a democracy---a democracy in which people's
rights are protected.  I hope that I've made myself clear on this.

Are we going to ""make do without"" like the people in New York City? 
You know New York City: That gun ban utopia you dream about, with
the millions of unregistered handguns?  New York City, by the way,
has a very high crime rate.

Perhaps you should know about a gungrabber's nightmare - Idaho.
Here in Idaho, the police give concealed carry permits to anyone
over 21 without a criminal record.  There are no gungrabber schemes
such as FOIDs, waiting periods, ""gun a month,"" or LTCs.  And horror
of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed
weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit
for concealed carry in an automobile).

I feel a hell of a lot safer in Boise than I would in your gun ban
dream state (e.g., Washington, D.C.).

>The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against
>you, the flow of history is against you ... this is it !

The voting public in Idaho is staunchly pro-gun.  Both senators
are NRA-endorsed ""A"" rated!  Buy a clue, pal.

Get out your wallet and buy another clue.  There are millions upon

They have a half-life approaching eternity.  And cosmoline is not

Ah, Freeman seems to forget from my statement that I am learning.  I have also

information to read.  Do you think, Freeman, that maybe this means I am
interested in learning?  I think it does because as you said people who don't

Another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you Freeman
and accept mistakes.  Sure, maybe it could have been some type of
misinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  I made my
statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry
about it but also to learn as much as you can.  They accepted my mistake and
gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  I have
read several posts of yours and have found them informative.  Why don't you
give me the same chance?

You don't know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  Just about ANYBODY
with basic manufacturing skill can turn out HIGH QUALITY submachineguns.  A 
couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building 
submachineguns in the school shop.

I suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of ""Smallarms of the 
World"".  Your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.

No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was ""a little bit

an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the 
people.  These representatives of the people have already decided
that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some
cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional 
interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority
of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example
of the people using their power of government.  If this is not

No, I simple stated that the people have a right to ""join a well

Just saw a new commercial(?) by the NRA. It starts out with a 
bunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime.
They finally realize that they need to put criminals away
longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun
law.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how
easy criminals get off ) 
In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law 
will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal)
watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.
Classic.

Good irony.  The Waco finale was on April 19, Patriot's Day.
On that day 218 years earlier, the militias of Concord, Mass.,
and other nearby towns repelled a gun-control raid by the
then-current Colonial government ...

What interpretations?  Just read it as it's written.
   ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
state, the right of the people, to keep and bear arms, shall not be
infringed.""

Where does it say ""The right of the people to be members of a militia shall
not be infringed"" or ""The right of the militia to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed?""  NOWHERE.


""Well-educated businessmen being necessary to the ability of the nation to
compete in the international marketplace, the right of the people to attend
schools shall not be infringed.""

Would you ""interpret"" this to mean that only businessmen should have a
protected right to attend schools?  Why or why not?

""Freed om of Religion"" has absolutely nothing to do with building a small

I agree that Koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator; this because
he grew up inside the cult, and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

That doesn't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. Or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

This was no MOVE fuck-up. A helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
There were no CS CANISTERS... a specially modified Abrams was pupming the
stuff in. No chance of starting a fire there. Kerosene lamps? Maybe one,
but not three fires. No way. Koresh wasn't just talking out of his ass. I
expected this to happen.

Maybe they WANTED it to look like murder. He had 50+ days. I think this was
coming the whole time. He didn't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the CS seige. He put them up into the tower
to die. Fuck all of you ""Big Brother"" paranoid freaks. The only good thing

In addition, the gas is specifically designed to force eyes

       Last I heard there were nine.  Apparently as of this point they've
found no bodies, except those killed during the initial assault a couple

would affect the mission.  Even the Freshman cadets here in ROTCland

  Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did
not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would
be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are
pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire 
seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the
very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it
could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.

  Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-
up occured, which is quite possible.

  The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires
*everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave 
like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And if
it was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.

  I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,
but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

  Then again, I rarely go off making blanket condemnations and pronouncments
within 2 hours of a very confusing incident over 175 miles away...

At least you're consistent.  I'm sure the highly propagandized Germans
tended to believe their government's version too in the thirties and

I think it was - he went into town fairly often, and was known to go
jogging.  This was even during the 9 month period when he was being
watched.  One wonders why the BATF went ahead, when they had been warned
according to an interview with a BATF agent, that the BD were expecting
them, and why they had the media in tow.  Almost looks like they wanted
to have a romp and a nice show for the media, and it all went to hell...

He was also never known to act violently.  He has always surrendered
peacefully before (but of course, the warrants were served peacefully).
He has been tried on the allegations before and found NOT GUILTY.

The justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased
$200,000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).
Last I heard this is not a crime, or indication of one.  I know of an
INDIVIDUAL with that much value in guns.  SHould he get a fly-thru-the-door
shoot-first-talk-later raid?  (grenades are shooting first, nobody I
know of can say 'oh, thats only a stun grenade, thats OK...').  Can you?
I sure cannot.  Also, one cannot be sure that 200K figure is not calculated
like the Feds calculate the value of a drug siezure...  Even so, it
is a 'so what' issue...  He wasn't bothering anyone (besides the
BATF who doesn't like folks other than themselves or other govt
people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved
religeous group.  Are we required to not offend the BATF these
days?  I sure hope it hasn't come to THAT...

MY point is, it DOES NOT ADD UP.  We need an independent investigation,
and NOW.  Assuming other than FBI/BATF are preserving the evidence.

>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

They had the premisis bugged.  I am inclined to think a further wait
would have saved lives.  One wonders why they didn't have emergency
gear on hand when they moved, and why they didn't turn on the water
when a fire was observed, instead of saying ""aw, gee, there is no water"".

Why so long before the fire gear even SHOWED UP - like after the building
had pretty much finished burning?  Fireman safety?  Isn't that a decision
the firefighters should be allowed to make?  No water?  Why didn't
the Feds TURN IT BACK ON?  They sure could cut it off quickly enough...

One does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...

What does 'taking responsibility' mean?  You think she is going to be
facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal?  You think
she is going to face ANY repercussions if the FBI/BATF are found to
have acted wrongly?  I don't.  It is a nice PR gimmick, though.

I am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation
for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the BATF or FBI.
I expect to hear ""they are our best law enforcement.  They wouldn't do
anything like that - NO WAY.  OUT of the QUESTION.  End of issue"".

I want to see an INDEPENDENT investigation, with full prosecuting and
subpoena powers.  With felony prosecution where felony acts are found.
Fat chance, I bet.  I bet the Justice Dept will have an internal
investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.

I hope I am wrong, that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb.

I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for
Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as
long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).

Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew
served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time
LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And ""snipers""
too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.

I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even
violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally
out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,
government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites
who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the
need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military
boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced
that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances
redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that
will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.
Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply
squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances
in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too
inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them
in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...

And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things
so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are
than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't
PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...

Unbelievable.

And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,
that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many
explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000
pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,
and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as
gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,
and could be explained by ""musta been a gas leak... "".  I think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning
and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible
to cover up.

A great deal of documentation exists on exactly that phenomenon. Especially
regarding Vietnam and the Mai Lai (sp?) massacre

Not that I'm suggesting that they started it on purpose but even if they
now know that they accidentally started (or contributed to it) you can
be sure the initial reaction is to lie. Remember the Iranian airliner

*sigh*

It is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign
them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation
into possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no
indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that
the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the
decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all
activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates
to an enforced vacation.

Why should they have ""done something""? The Davidians had not attacked

It is not yours nor the governments right to tell others what they have

Is child abuse now within the jurisdiction of the department of the

I suspect we saw the latter.  However, the injustice implied in letting

I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e.,
plutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain
a federal permit to own such materials.

Actually, why bother looking it up?  From the material we covered last
term (in 10 weeks) of Ge/Ch 127 (Nuclear Chemistry), I could *derive*
what it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge,
I (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly
available chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics 
behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,
however . . . but not impossible using a few ""tricks of the trade.""
And if I really wanted to be nasty, I could include a core of 
hydrogen and deuterium . . .

Of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material
to start with, and living long enough to put a bomb together. 
(Plutonium has some *nasty* properties . . .)

   For the moment, forget about BATF incompetence or FBI hubris.  Did
anybody catch Rep. Charles Shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 BMG cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these.  (I presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)

  So what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:

1.   A ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 BMG)

2.   A ban on ""sniper rifles""

3. A ban on ""stockpiling"" guns and ammunition.


BTW: Shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman I have seen on
     the news. I wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

If you look at his other votes, and positions as an agent of redistribution

are incompatible with his obvious world-view. They are a threat to the

ACLU Official Policies.

Policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion
pictures: ""Industry sponsored ratings systems create the
potential for constraining the creative process and thus
contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of
providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings
inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of
expression.""

In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU states in its
Policy 84: ""The insertion of the words `under God' into the
Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional
principle of separation of Church and State.""

Policy 120 states that, ""Military conscription under any
circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and
constitutional guarantees."" The ACLU objects to the draft even
during wartime because of the ""anti-democratic power it gives
government to wage war without support of the people.""

Policy 125 states, ""The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into
war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes
against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the
actions of the United States military and other combatants
against the people of South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam.""

Policy 133 states, ""The ACLU recognizes that US government
reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign
and domestic policy, while propounded as a defense of democracy,
is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. Four decades of
adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of
our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount
threat to our civil liberties.""

Policy 217 objects to roadblocks ""where drivers are stopped for
sobriety tests"" because they ""violate Fourth Amendment
principles."" 

Policy 242 states the following on criminal
sentencing: ""The most appropriate correctional approach is
reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of
reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the
offender within the community than by incarceration. Probation
should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions
to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made,
should be limited to the most serious of offenses, such as murder
or treason.""

Considering that the uses include self defense, hunting, target shooting
and collecting, I don't buy the notion that the vast majority of people
don't ""own, use or display a firearm"".

But let's say your contention is true.  What's the point of ""get[ting]

       In the first place, you have to realize the feeling goes both

        We've got guns, they've got a monarch and an economy on the verg
of collapse.  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.

       Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.
The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about
how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and
the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light
shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,
and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that
the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever
something was wanted, it was smuggled in.
       If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced
years before.

       Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.
Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited
in the U.S.

>Hell, here in Britain, the cops don't even carry guns. (That's another funny

       Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise,
and several police agencies are considering have permanent ""firearms
officers"" to deal with it.

       According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have
risen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped
5%.

       Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,
that's the ticket.

Then it also supports basing such regulations on ignorance.

Miller had disappeared, and nobody bothered to present _his_

shotguns were used in the World War I trenches, and in other
tight spots ever since guns had been invented.  Would _you_

The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that 
the two sides have exchanged roles.

The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)
than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,
it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in
California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of
these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police
now confiscate property, without trial, under a ""good faith probable
cause"" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug
dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a
majority will answer ""yes"" if you ask them whether civil liberties and
due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The
Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't
know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but
I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.

According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over
TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the
marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own
business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves
than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under
the ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protections
have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have
proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians
who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only
legal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our young
people the message that we are serious about winning the War On
Murder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun
prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine
they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different
tastes in recreational drugs.

What goes around comes around.

RKBA archive: general information and anonymous ftp instructions.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste,
has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA
related information.  This directory can be used for things like
articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,
the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not
meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.

So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first
and then ask here.

Instructions:

Short version for techies:

The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the
directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands
get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command ""type binary""
to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved
to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.

I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if
the file you want to read or write already is archived.

Long version for non-techies:

In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on
the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:

	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu

If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp
command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a
login:
	Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):

Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:

	ftp

Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:

	Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:

I would enter:

	l.v.cipriani@att.com

You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines
or similar as output:

	Remote system is UNIX.
	Using binary mode to transfer files.

Next, the command prompt is printed:

	ftp> 

If you do not get the line ""Using binary mode to transfer files.""
Run the command:

	type binary

Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many
directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are

	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
and
	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming

There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.

When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive
files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba

To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with
the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming

Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter
another command.

To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are
in run the command:

	ls -l

This will produce something like:

total 6021
-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP
-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX

-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu
... and so on ...

Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields
are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of
the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need
to be concerned with.

To get a file run the command ""get"" followed by the name of the file
you want, for example:

	get INDEX
or
	get noduty

After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:

	Transfer complete.
	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)

You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.
You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the
file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025
you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first
and then retrieve it:

	cd congress/103rd
	get HR1025

Once you're finished you can log off with the command:

	quit

If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little
different.  First of all you should find out if the file already
exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above
and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The
index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba
directory.  For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File: whitemanslaw

White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985
Reason magazine
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login
and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once
you are in the incoming directory use the command:

	put file_name

In this case:

	put whitemanslaw

Again there'll be a ""Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered
in so many seconds"" message.  Now your file is on the archive
machine.

Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure
there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same
as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll
overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].

Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a
file by the same name in the rkba directory.

Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for
the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.

If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute
a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.

If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so
be sure to let me know first.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me.

Oh, not more than a few feet, I wouldn't think.  I'm sorry IF your paternal

IF they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( I  
can pound on your door and claim to be the police, will you just lay down and  
take it if I do?), then he could be justified in firing on the ATF in

position on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor 
of Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen's unexpired term.

The representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and

Subject: WI and IL firearms law Questions
Organization: University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
Lines: 39
NNTP-Posting-Host: 129.89.9.13



A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  

Question #1

According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is
'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for
obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'

*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm
on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.



Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it
have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What
if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,
is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
period? 

Question #2

As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if
you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting?
Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  
One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
rich or famous or related to the mayor?

Please send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g
a little faster than I can handle.  Thanks again

      Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm.

      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon.""
The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987.

I've already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread.  I saw a brief 
news report which led to the above inaccuracy.  I have since seen detailed 
summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning.

So, why didn't the BD's leave when the gas was first introduced much 
earlier in the morning?  Didn't they care about the children?

Why didn't they release the children weeks ago?

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,
such laws have been found to violate the state constitution. 
But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the
states. It was written to limit the federal government only. 
The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions
of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact
wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme
Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it
directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right
(indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the
state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that 
particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on
the Second Amendment.

pg. 18, col. 1, Editorial page  
	""Judgment at Waco""

	Now the scientific and political scrutiny of the
horror show in Waco begins, though nothing can
undo the tragedy that might have been prevented 
there.
	Forensic experts will study the rubble and
ashes of the Branch Davidian compound, where at
least 85 people, including 24 children, perished in
smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of
a manipulative madman AND A STUNNING LAPSE IN
JUDGMENT BY FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
   [emphasis added by me]
	Investigators will re-create conditions at the
compound and identify accelerants and other fac-
tors fueling the inferno.  That is their strong suit.
	But the public must question why agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation lacked the oper-
ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve
the 51-day standoff free of flames and fury.
	The loss of life most clearly reflects the demen-
tia of cult leader David Koresh, whose personal
delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious-
ness.  His assembly of Davidians had stockpiles of
arms--and had used them.  LIttle in the way of
rationality could be expected from Koresh, a self-
confsesed ""sinner without equal.""
	What continues to mystify are th eactions of
federal agents, who bungled the case from the
start.  The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when
100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent
on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-
ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-
bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier
oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the
complex had not been adequately explored.
	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that
those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into 
the siege there was no public outcry to storm the
compound.
	It had been correctly perceived that the chil-
dren inside ""Rancho Apocalypse"" were essentially 
hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no
reason for the government to be impatient.  The
government's superior firepower, control of water
and utilities and freedom of movement created the
conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.
	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the
FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for
abandondoning the course of patience.
	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was
growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-
cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an
M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-
ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they
would have to be weighted against the potential for
eve ngreated hamr.


etc etc tec....
[paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]

But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,
and inexperienced president who did not pay
enough attention to the life-and -death decisions
being made on WAco.
	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would
be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-
forcement officers--a common problem among
prosecutors.
	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must
be conducted by both the executive and legislative
branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze 
started.  Though apportioning blame will play a 
role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies
to elude the fire next time.

Which works fine until you end up in the hospital because you were hit on the
head and your wallet, with your insurance card, is stolen.  This happened to 
me, and it took six months to sort the mess out.  These sorts of plans sound

James, it could be that they were determined to stay together in the compound
no matter what happened. Perhaps the fire was accidental, and the DB simply
refused to leave the compod. Perhap they died fighting the fire? who knows.
we will have to wait and see. i persaonlly find it hard to believe that they

	First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of
penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.  Unless that
expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice ""pop"" and not
enough threat for even firefighters to worry about.  Finally, it's
rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to
a crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were
quite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.

	However, it's my contention that it makes little difference
whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem
to have shared responsibility for both.

It was filmed the day of the first assault.  The BDs clearly allowed the
BATF agents who were shot and wounded to leave the compound.  The

Or, did anyone notice that when Clinton referred to the Davidians as
'religious fanatics' that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from
the reporters ? 

To me this was not only in poor taste, but it showed the media's bias and
hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe.  No wonder they
have been cheerleading for the kgBATF and the FBI during this whole affair.

The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.  
The documentary disucussed Koresh's ""Christ"" status inside the cult, 
cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader 
gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  I will let 
others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is 
technically child abuse or not.

All true.

Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the 
history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history 
and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding 
what happened at Jonestown.

Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may 
also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses 
they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in 
this badly handled affair.

Article in this morning's Houston Post....""negotiators send food to

riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.

I know it's not the same ""group"" but the mindset appears to be common to
""those what rule"" here lately....they won't give diddley to the BD's in Waco
but they treat criminals as deserving of ""humanitarian gestures"".

This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more
priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding
citizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the ""leaders of
the system""?

Could it be that the criminal is one of the ""tools"" the ""authorities"" are
using to ""excuse"" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon
the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime
problem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to ""our help"".

If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the

be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every

The existence of the weapon in and of itself (and this is also
true for biologics and chemical weapons, but for slightly different
reasons) poses a threat to living critters.  Can you say ""neutron
and other radiation flux due to radioactive decay"", boys and girls?

But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the
neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water
turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would 
also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives
would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear
warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.

As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince
is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in
a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private
ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must
be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe
condition. If any random private citizen could not properly
keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation
is clearly appropriate.

I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend
themselves and their community. If you look at the American 
revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves
from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They
didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for 
example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same
old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and
destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.
But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited
for that.

There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The
Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal
weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members
to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers
other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)
a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)
should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a 
disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.
The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely
democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only
50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would
be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular
will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the
members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the
form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's
firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not
of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite
different from the general public (at the very least, they
would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and
character of the militia requires that each member provide
a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal
weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

""Well Regulated"", at the time of its writing and in the context of the Second Amendment,
means ""Properly trained and equipped.""

It modern language it would read:

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
""months of investigation"" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their
advertisments?

The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer
see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.

These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for
sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under
the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.

If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to
run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your
displeasure over their censorship doctrine.

Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  Perhaps you'd
like to send them your thoughts on this issue!

Oakland Tribune		Daily Review		Alameda Times-Star
POB 28883		POB 5050		1516 Oak St.
Oakland, CA 94604	Hayward,94540	Alameda, CA 94501

Argus			Tri Valley Herald	San Leandro Times
3850 Decoto Rd.		POB 10367		161 W. Juana Ave.
Fremont, CA 94555	Pleasanton, CA 94588	San Leandro, CA 94577

1201 Evans Ave		110 5th St.		750 Ridder Park Dr.
San Fran., CA 94124	San Fran., CA 94103	San Jose, CA 95190

Then there are six pages of ""facts"".  I can not validate these facts, and 
there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true.  Here are the topic
headlines:

- Big Media Snow Job
- Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death
- I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove
  that Hospitals Cause Death
- How NBC, CBS, and ABC have scammed the American people on ""gun control""
- American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism
- Why TV journalists lie
- The Government with the help of the TV networks, has succeeded in playing
  one group against the other
- Gun laws are unconstitutional
- American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws
- The Government is trying to devide and conquer
- The CIA wants your firearms

and so on for six pages.

So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying
to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers
from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or
other recreational use.

Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.

I'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:
 
The Brady Bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to
it in Congress?  Did Bush veto it?  If so, when?
 
Also, the state of Virginia, I believe, just passed a gun control bill on
Febrauary 25 of this year.  I think it limits gun purchases to one a month -
is this correct?  What was the bill number?
 
Anyone?

On a Los Angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the
family of the MURDERED rancher said that the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before
the raid.

This strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;
any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.

In Viet Nam, Lt Calley was tried and convicted of murder because his
troops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. It is time
that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to
standards at least as moral as the military's.

Greed killed the rancher, possibly greed killed the Davidian children.
Government greed.

It is time to prosecute the leaders who perform these invasions.

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M-16
from an AR-15?  That he can see the difference between a semi-auto and
a full-auto UZI?  That he can see the difference between the various
versions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the M-11/9?

If so, I'd love to hear the details, if only because they'll demonstrate
that Kratz is blowing smoke.

Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that's
quite common....

Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
that my parents car wasn't much like Richard Petty's, even though it
looked just like it (except for the paint job).  Things must have been
different with Kratz.

>Sure it's on TV but why does that make a difference?

No, it doesn't, but that's irrelevant.  If visual inspection of the
outside worked, TV would be acceptable, but since it doesn't, the fact
that it's just as good as seeing in person doesn't mean much.

   There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.
   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15
   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

Assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant ENTERING the
fire from the other side?  Like they were surrounded by the fire, and
rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them?

In other words they were TRAPPED by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?

Does that sound plausable?  Not as dramatic as Korash forcing them to
stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...

HB 1776 is for Concealed Carry in Texas.  It provides for licensing
citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction

4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal

(sic) Oh, you're really bright. As if nobody would have understood it was a
typo.

Several parents with children who either had at one time or currently were
inside the compound made the aforementioned charges. One parent actually
spoke about said charges (in reference to his 13-year old daughter) WITH
Koresh on the phone.

You missed my point entirely.

Anti-social. Normally meaning a response against societal norms. Stealing

Is this a joke?  The legal way to serve a search warrant is to knock on
the door.  Tossing in a grenade to serve a search warrant violates the
US Constitution and is hence, illegal.  The BD complied with legal
search warrants in the past.  I do not understand why the BATF used an
illegal means to serve their search warrant last February.

Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that
there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which
rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.

What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I
believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems
with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as
well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.

1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at
some time before the Feb. 28th raid?

2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action?

And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in
general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations.

One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the
""balls"" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

I doubt if Koresh had let the BATF have a look inside his place as they 
intended to do, ""orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and
a holocaust"" would never have come to pass.

The BD's killed members of the BATF on the first day. ""Orchestrated character
assassination and noise torture"" seem like a small retribution.  The use
of tanks is quesionable however.

It was around 1969 in the Shenandoah Valley near Woodstock, Virginia.  Me,
my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally
desolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down
on us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks
from what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us.
Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the
punks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them to
knock it off.  They responded that we should ""Get f***ed!"".  Me and my
friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above
their heads.  They ran.  With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads,
we proceeded on our journey.

Sorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more
""violent"" level than we were already experiencing.  I guess we should
have tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society
had instilled in them and was driving them to do such things.  Guess
that's a cross I'll have to bear.

If in said situation. I would, reviewing other cases I've seen reported
on in the articles I've read etc.., suggest the safest legal course of action
is as follows. Warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a 
weapon(Yes!Even though it's blatantly obvious now that you have it out!)
and that you will shoot him if he advances/does not cease whatever hostile 
action he is currently involved in.( ie: Drop the knife or I'll shoot!)
Repeat this process three times,if you can!(not if he's pointing a freaking
gun at you himself!That's kinda impractical.) (There are variables here and
I will try to address them in turn) After said warning (considering it's
 ignored) Aim center mass and fire until he drops! This is not sadism, it's
practicality.If he hasn't gone down he's still a threat!(Why I support .45)
IF HE TURNS AND RUNS DO NOT PURSUE OR FIRE AT HIS BACK! SHOT'S FIRED IN ANGER
WILL BURN YOU LATER! (Though in some cases the I can see where that might not
bother me all that much!) If you do drop him! REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE! Have a
Bystander or witness(Or Create one by yelling at the top of your lungs!)
call the police, and wait! Reholster your weapon VISIBLY! Or place it on 
the ground nearby. Do not attempt to recollect your brass.The police will
use it's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and
that of any witnesses. Mentally mark witnesses! If the police say that none
came forward let them know who you saw! Attempt to keep your weapon loaded
with the minimum required(how the hell can I phrase this?) Try to avoid special
purpose ammunition. Hollow points and Hydrashock rounds give the opposing
lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you
fully intended to kill someone! The only special purpose rounds that I can
think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the
Glaser Safety Slug (oh what a lovely name SAFETY SLUG) The stated purpose
and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.
(ie. Attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate, not 
ricochette, and which is designed to STOP (Not Kill (Gee, to bad the two often

I don't know this specific ratio, but I do have an earlier post that says
a gun is 33 times more likely to defend someone (including the times where
the gun isn't fired, just scares the perpetrator away) than it is to kill
someone. (including self defense)  The post is kind of long, but I'll be
glad to dig it up and email it to anyone who asks.

I suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word
""release"" is peculiar.  Let's say you and your family are besieged
in your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic
weapons.  They give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying
rabbits to blare, ""You in there!  Release the children, and they'll
be perfectly all right.""  Stipulate on top of that that you may not
have your epistemology entirely in order.  Is it entirely surprising
that the Branch Davidians were reluctant to ""release"" their children

Up to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be

I have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the

""unsealed"" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.

these previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.

Funny, I don't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements,
either.  Where did you say you heard all this?

What *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in
the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This
from the newspaper and national TV news.

Did you also hear that it's the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to
homes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.

Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on
something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few
years I have heard of one case after another of government running
completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the
government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I
intend to put together what I call the ""American Horror File"": a
compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod
over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing
especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,
and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,
but including any other cases for which I can find decent
documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,
red-hot enraged at their government.

The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text
and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent
years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage
people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and
print out copies and give them to neighbors.

This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on
how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer
information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific
instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to
join me in collecting and researching information for this project.

I do not feel like the cameras were out of range.  Cameras watched the first 
confrontation.  Cameras watched the banners.  Cmaeras watched the final 
confrontation with tanks.  Cameras watched the fire.  When weren't cameras 
able to watch?  When would cameras be unable to watch people coming out with 
their hands up?

Well, that is what BATF should have done.  Either, Koresh would have gone 
peaceably as he has done in the past, or perhaps it was already too close 
to the apocalypse in his own mind.  It is hard to predict the actions of 
a leader who would not release the children when most rational people would.

Now will you answer my question up top?

Fellow Texans and Members of Crime Strike in Texas
 
Crime Strike in Texas has a loosely knit coalition with most
Victims Rights Groups in Texas. We ask that you write a
letter protesting the release of the following murderer.
 
This letter should be written to :
 
Raven Kazen - Victims Services
Board of Pardons and Paroles
P.O. Box 13401 - Capital Station
Austin, Texas 78711
 
The letter should be written if at all possible on RED PAPER
as that was agreed on at one of our first meetings . It
represents the coalition and all of its parts as well as the
heart ache of those left behind and the blood spilled by
these criminals. The letter should have only one name on it
so it can be filed in the folder of that criminal waiting for
his next try at parole.
 
List of Criminals:
 
Today we have only one parole to protest , On October 4,
1990, Mark Steven Hughes rendered numerous blows to the head
of James Allen Pompa . Ten month old James went into a coma
and died two days later.
 
On July 8, 1992, Mark Steven Hughes pled guilty to Injury to
a Child and received a ten-year sentence. According to Texas
law, Mark became eligible for parole on January 4, 1992 --
six months before he was even sentenced!
 
Would you join us in strongly protesting the release from
prison of Mark Steven Hughes, who beat a baby to death .
 
Mark Steven Hughes - beat to death the baby boy of
Russel Pompa -- Reference Mark Steven Hughes - TDC# 633546
 
 
Mark your envelope   ""PROTEST LETTER"" on the front and back.
 
A typical letter is indicated on the next page ---

He should be kept in prison for his full sentence and not be
released at any time prior to his full sentence for any
reason.

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and 
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.

'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in 
using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, 
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group 
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might 
support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.

Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.

>I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,
>but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven't offered

I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even
contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than
a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the
same thing, then I got 'educated.'

People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how
quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick
(within a minute or so) death.

The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are
'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.

Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by
accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a
DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and
ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and
strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained
martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as
the attacker.

Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison.

If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced
attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old
man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike
in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3
seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest
with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the
pointed end.)

Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.
Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'

This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman
in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That
lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All
four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta
girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was
out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was
on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think
civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.

The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife
attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk
(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and
is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a
caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually
do this.

Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live
and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason
'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive.

I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now
know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would
have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I
WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not
fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen
behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do
whatever it takes.

Rick.

I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other
 gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  On the other hand,
 its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses 
 prevented lives from being lost.  In other words, the lives_lost
 is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter
 number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful 
 self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real 
 high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost.

As a semi-related point, check out Kleck's ""Point Blank"".  I believe
 it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.

Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody says
something, yes the letter is a bit ""sharp"" in tone.  I have been writting
reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return
in the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that
upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events
in Texas REALLY have me pissed.

-------------------
							April  20, 1993
Representative Skaggs,

Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response
you stated that ""Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.
My question to you is, ""what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
firearms?""  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
I say this because there are only two possible paths of ""gun control"" which you
could have been referencing.

Either:
1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this
case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the
""cult"" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these
guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by
themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your
Church to be a cult!

This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of ""thought crimes.""  You
and Pat Robertson should really get along.

2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the
""cult.""  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by
some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh
illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that
David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted 
him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished
Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple
hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

I have heard claims that they were ""stockpiling weapons.""  Yet considering the
number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of
Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged ""stockpiling?""

Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that
has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for ""reasonable""
restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain
250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They
are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR
district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I
have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your ""reasonable""
gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
representing Sarah Bradys'?

In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.
And your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  The
real number from the Department of Public Safety:

                   Murders, Non-neg hom		Car fatalities
1991			2651			  3079
1992			2240			  3057

Texas only has ""liberal"" gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside 
from that, it's probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
goes.

The state was Virginia, and the law passed.

That right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life,
liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not
a criminal, and I don't indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.  
So please explain how I am ""inflicting"" anything on other people.

Why thanks for your reply to my post.  By the way, I never, never ever said 
that it was right to shoot ""THOSE kind"" of babies.  However it was the Branch
Davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their ""savior"" 
(yeah right budy boy) because he had brain-washed them into believing that 
what ever he says is the truth, even if means that they are to give up their
lives for <<<<HIS>>>> cause.  Therefore it is Davids fault and not the ATF's
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out, this was 50 days to many for me and
for many of the rest of the U.S.  I am however sad to hear of the death of any 
child unlike the sick bastard I supposedly am.

Pardon me, here, but I don't trust Spectre's motives here at all.  Spectre

Right on the money here.  We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the 
BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set
up the assault on American citizens.  

We must NOT count on Spectre, though, to get it done.

NO SURRENDER!
Delivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993

It is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel
threatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are
immediate threats, the things that women will tell you they're afraid
of. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The
stranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the
house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The
mugger...the rapist. 

And what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door
locked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and
always, there's the implied question ""what's a pretty little thing like
you doing without a husband around to protect you?

But what if you don't like dogs? Like living alone? Don't have 10
years to devote learning judo?

What if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that ""rape victims
using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -
and were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any
other form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for
robbery/assault)(Kleck,123) 

What if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend
on the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a
crime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that
the police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the
whole community.

As a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice
themselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to
help themselves?

Here's a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says
""no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-
pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out."" But if
a woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient
means possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.
""Eughh, how could you? I'd be terrified!"" they ask. How could you
hurt someone? They'll repeat the lie: it'll just get taken away from
you. In truth, 1% of ""defensive gun uses"" result in the offender taking
the gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)

Well, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already
made that hard choice. We've decided that we are not going to be
victimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We're buying more
guns than every before. We're learning how to use them - and teaching
others, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are
preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.
We're taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We're
going to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE
INTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.

But there's another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more
secretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.

That menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that
governments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed
people. It's the way they survive.

In our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people
both at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and
threatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it'll do next -
what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides
""it's for your own safety"" or ""we know best"". Any person who acted
like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his
life and locked up as a habitual offender.

But this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who
should be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt
me? Then why did you file your income tax? 

Like any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something
that can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn't crazy if someone's
really after you. And make no mistake, they're after you and they're
after me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,
Metzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we're lucky, they'll settle for
our assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. 

As citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices
given to women: to surrender or to fight. 

Surrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the
disappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. 

A battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep
the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if
they have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:
""the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.""

As a patriot, I will point out the error in the government's ways. I will
do my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,
and speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth. And always
remember that Rebellion can lead to Bunker Hill and Saratoga......or it
can lead to Tiananmen Square. 

When the time comes to stand up, if I have to give my life to keep
them from going too far, if there is a Tiananmen Square in our future,
I intend to be there. And no matter what lies they tell and no matter
what laws they pass, I intend to meet them with something more
substantial in my hand than a brick. 

My opinions are, of course, my own.

       I don't think we've got a conspiracy on our hands, or anything
vaugely similar.  I do think that the Feds showed a distinct lack of
both intelligence and disregard for others safety throughout this whole
mess.

       I do think the FBI and the BATF screwed up big.  What made me
really concerned was FBI director William Sessions being on CNN engaging
in what could only be called spin control before the place had even
cooled down.  Evertyhing had literally blown up in their faces and I felt
there had to be something more important he should have been doing...

Actually, they won't.  What they'll tell you is that if you add up the
number of suicides, murders of one drug dealer by another, legit
self-defenses of a battered spouse, and so on, you'll end up with a
number that is much larger than the number of self-defense killings
against strangers committed in the bedroom.  (BTW - they didn't
honestly count the latter either, but let's not quibble.)  They
try to claim that comparison is between the costs of self-defense
and the benefits, but they're wrong.

This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it
doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to
kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him.
While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of
stops, it isn't equal.

Anyone who confuses that comparison with an honest evaluation
is either lying or....

Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types
of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an
individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should
not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.

By the end of the Clinton administration a lot of things will be

""Tough titty"" ?  My how eloquent you are.

As for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if
he thinks he's going to pass some comprehensive gun legislation.
He will sign the Brady Bill if it gets to his desk.  We will do
whatever we can to either keep that from happening, or modify it
such that it is acceptable to us.

>You had better discover ways to make do without firearms.

Sorry, that's not possible.  And that's why we won't give them up
either.  Legally or illegally, American's will keep their firearms.
The number of unregistered weapons in New York City is in the millions.
There aren't even close to that number of violent criminals there.

>The number of cases of firearms abuses has ruined your cause.

If the gov't was serious about stopping violent crime they would
keep violent criminals in jail for a long long time where they
belong instead of letting them out on early release.

>There is nothing you can do about it.

Hey, we can go into politics too if we feel like it.

being unharmed than someone who does nothing.

This claim hasn't been retracted or contradicted yet, as many earlier
government claims have?  At least one clip showed a fire erupting
after a tank busted in a wall.  We have unsubstantiated claims by
the government about the FLIRs spotting ""simultaneous"" fires.

That's easy.  Six hours of CS gas, heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading
fire, confusion, panic.  Only 10% got out.  The building was collapsing
all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck.

>And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.

The Davidians may have committed suicide, or some few zealots among
them might have started the fires -- that is possible.  But, given
the government's earlier inability to tell a straight story, I find
my above scenario equally possible.  I wait for some independent
investigation to look into the whole thing.

It would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been
consistent and forthright throughout.  Keeping the press far away
and ghettoized in ""pools"" was not conducive to building up trust.
Sealing the warrants was non-optimal, as well.  This operation
was out of control from the git-go.

Speaking only for myself, I think Bush and Reagan should have been
impeached over Iran-Contra.

In 1979, I would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to
the government.  No more.  Like I said, I'll wait to see the
results of an independent investigation -- if there is one --

	Would *you* have come out if you knew the only national TV
cameras were well over a mile away, and yet the agents with the guns
were only a few yards away?  They had contact with a lawyer, so I
am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation

lawyer had the BATF pinned on rights violations if the BD's
acted as witnesses, hence the arson.  I doubt that one too, but
it is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is
a rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe.

>Do you disbelieve everything the FBI says?

	As a matter of course, given how they've allowed no other

far as the FBI is concerned their statements carry the same amount
of weight as photons at rest.

	That's what gets me too.  It is likely the cult members were
holed up in an enforced place inside the building.  With a decent arson
attempt I suspect many of them could have been trapped.  In addition,
the introduction of CS gas for several hours would have rendered many
of them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit.  All the props
are there, but proving what scene was played is difficult.  The only
certainty is that the FBI and BATF have few witnesses against them.

An interesting idea consider:   
   At any locality where a buy-back program is being instituted, get a list
of guns they received and compare serial numbers with a list of stolen guns
and sue the people responsible for the program if those guns were destroyed.
Criminal charges can also be made.( Receiving stolen property, destruction of
private property etc.)

Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the
NFA '34 tax.  Snatches of the court's decision:

The Second Amendment was intended to ""assure the continuation and render 
possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be 
interpreted and applied with that end in view.""

The militia includes ""all males physically capable of acting in concert 
for the common defense.""

However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, ""certainly it is not within 
judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military 
equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""

""Judicial notice"" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such
evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming
that they had ruled that it wasn't.

> Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the

I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-
barrelled (""sawed-off"") shotguns in war.

Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American 
War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by
US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to ""tunnel rats"" 
in Vietnam, but, of course, ""Miller"" took place in 1939.

Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of 
guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument 
unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs
in that class.  

I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe 
we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments 
have been banning or trying to ban because they have ""no sporting purpose"" 
and ""no provate citizen would ever need these guns"" DO fall under the 
protection of the Second.  

So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at 
some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship 
training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing 
this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.

 Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially
lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the
muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or
plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the
intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also
seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].
 Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to 
be a proper reaction [and so does the law].  
 Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force
has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the
less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some
risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent 
since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
more deadly.

  BUT...  Suppose they had waited.  The WORST outcome would have been the

I called the Texas bill tracking people (800/253-9693) again today 
regarding HB 1776 -- Concealed Carry.  Well, it was supposed to come
up for a vote this past Wednesday, but the bill got sent back to
the Public Safety Committee.  The PSC gave it a favorable rating
AGAIN, and the bill must now be scheduled for debate by
the Calendars Committee AGAIN.

I want this man to tell me how in the hell you can take the 
explosives used in the WTC bombing, considering that the

one.  Ammonium nitrate, to be exact . . . of which about

My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts.

Robin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts
will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property
poor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending. 
IMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of
the districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It
penalizes districts that have excelled.

And the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the
unfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise
another!

     I HEARTILY agree.  Now that the BATF warrant has been 
     unsealed, it is CLEAR that Clinton and Reno supported an
     ILLEGAL raid.  Did they not KNOW this?



     NO authority for a 'no-knock"" raid
     NO authority to use helicopters.
     NO authority to search for a ""drug lab""

    And, apparently, not even any authority to search for ""automatic

==============================================================
Hi Folks;

Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening
statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,
each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.

The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to
Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal
government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal
agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for
trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver
to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted
when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and
began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people
were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter
when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.

The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern
Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted
simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to
sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution
alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also
argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when
he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,
but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist
angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The
failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given
an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.
The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed
Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver
then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal
agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,
there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:
However, agents were near the body for an extended period of
time and could have played with the select-fire - this will
have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims
that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?]
of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.

Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made
that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist

Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that
this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged
with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that
the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]

Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters
heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests
outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate
again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including
""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary,
working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride,
not white power.""

Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview
with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly
what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.

In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about
a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the
courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence
in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some
tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent
were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they
believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,
repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the
defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the
recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed
off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another
good one!).

Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to
begin presenting evidence.

Drew

That's a revisionist account of what happened.  Gritz was well-aware
of Duke's presence on the ticket.  Given that Gritz is not at all shy
about associating and promoting other white supremacists (such as the
Christian Identity movement or Willis Carto), whatever reasons Gritz
had to leave the ticket had nothing to do with Duke's presence.

I believe Chip Berlet has a Populist Party newsletter from the time with

It is silly to make this statement.  Fifteen minutes after the fire
started, the ""official word"" out of FBI  headquaters in DC was
that the DV's committed suicide.  It would seem logical that the
lantern story has more credibility.  You can't even to pretend to

So?  Kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?

Even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents ARE NOT
gang-members.

How was it obvious?  Were they not trying to hit the target?  Or, does
Kratz confuse ""marksmanship"" with ""trying to simulate a post""?  If so,
that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand
that that exclusion would be an error.  (It excludes a lot of legit
""gun games"" as well.)

>don't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by

Sounds like practical pistol or maybe IPSC.  It also sounds like how a
self-defense shooter might well practice.  The only things that action
excludes are hunting and ""like a post"" shooting.  Kratz should get out
more often.

Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents
have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade 
from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif
consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the
color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would
undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it
ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.  

As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right
about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from 
those who don't know what it is.

Hi,

In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a
small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is
that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the
National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.

I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer
to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with
nature on it's own terms.

Did they or did they not sustain Miller's conviction? I don't have the
text of the case handy. 

Yes, shotguns had been used in WWI, the Spanish-American War, and the
US Civil War. That was not in question. The possession of a sawed-off
shotgun was, i.e., a weapon altered to improve concealibility.

You are free to produce evidence that I'm not willing to abide with
all the implications of this. 

Just because I don't whole-heartedly endorse the NRA position does not
mean that I oppose the RKBA. This attitude is what makes the NRA
unpopular.

Nope.  Here in Northern California, a newspaper recently did a survey,

Violent solutions are passe'?  I take it you propose disarming the police,

Please don't mention RKBA in the same breath as the KKK.  RKBA is about
being able to defend yourself and others, not about killing the innocent.
Actually, your mention of the KKK is rather funny, considering that the
first gun control law in the US were created specifically to disarm black

That includes suicides.  Since it has been shown in other countries that
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for
doing oneself in (studies include some done/published in Japan, Canada,
Austria, Norway), suicides ought not be included in the count.

If this is done, the number of vehicle-related deaths greatly exceeds that
of firearms-related deaths in Texas.

Certainly not.

Why?  Unless it's doing something that directly hurts someone else, what's
the point?  (Otherwise, you'd better stop operating all motor vehicles, since
the price of operating them *greatly* exceeds the cost in lives of firearms.

>One state (don't remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could

WEll, it's been done at least twice.  South (North?) Carolina did it a few
years back...and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country
rise quite a bit.

Virginia just passed the law...no word yet on what the results will be, but
I'd be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates won't be one of them.

>I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on

Self-defense doesn't ""inflict"" on other people (except perhaps the criminal
who's tried to do you damage, and maybe indirectly on future potential victims
who might not become victims).

You're sitting in your home reading a good book.  Your neighbors think
you're a quiet, upstanding citizen.  A random person anonymously calls 
the authorities and tells them you beat your children, sleep with all 
the neighbor wimmen, and own a bunch of ""nasty 50mm machine guns.""  

Now what are they supposed to do?

Ah, I see.  They're supposed to send 100 men in horse trailers with
automatic weapons, storm onto your roof, and throw grenades at your 
house with no warning.  Then, after subjecting you to noise torture
and telling the national news media for a month what a filthy son of 
a bitch you are, they're supposed to gas you and knock your house 
around a bit until they manage to collapse it, cause a fire, or 
something equally conclusive.

Hope your neighbors don't tumble to this -- at least none of them that
might have a craving for a ringside seat at some cheap but dramatic 
local entertainment at someone else's expense.  Or maybe even
PARTICULARLY at your expense.

At least they won't have to read you your rights, Joe -- obviously you
had no use for them anyway.

       As a data point from Tennessee, a friend of mine and a police

you were perfectly justified you're likely in for a great deal of

Dunno if you'll find it in the Constitution, but that other document of American
liberty, that kids are taught to hallow in school, is the Declaration of
Independence.  That document is in fact a justification not just for the right
if revolution, but of the DUTY of revolution by the people, once the government
gets too oppressive.  It is a very radical document, and I recommend all
Americans... especially those in office... read it once a year.

Did the RATE of crime fall?  If not, the ban was of no use.  It is the rate of  
violent crime that matters, not the tools used.  ""It's the crime, stupid!""

Apparently that became the weapon of choice after the shotguns were banned.   
After that, they'll decide the car of choice  is the Saab, and propose a ban on

well, you might as well go naked.  forget the matches, backpack, sleeping
bag and all the rest that's is a modern convenience.  a firearm is just
a tool.  as some people won't carry gaiters, some people do.  firearms
should be in the same category.  it should be a personal choice.

Excuse me but I do know what I safety is supposed to do.  It's basic purpose -
not to let the gun fire until you're ready.  Christ, I've known that since I
had my first Crosman air gun.  You don't know me so don't make assumptions

safties from reports, looking at them at a gun shop, and friends who own one.

From the things I have read/heard Glocks are always knocked because of the
trigger safety.  They are supposedly harder to learn to use properly.  Every
article that I have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.  And don't ask
me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or
rec.guns articles laying around.  Boy, you can't make a simple statement on

someone made the good point that this discussion is getting too close to r.g
(And yes I know that I had something to do with that).

On Ted Koppel last night, the ubiquitous Australian woman claimed that
Koresh trained the women (years ago) how to commit suicide by swallowing
cyanide or by putting a gun in their mouth.  With cyanide on hand, why
choose to roast yourself?  There are too many unanswered questions here.

You don't have to pay attention to any one source, neither do you
have to abandon your critical thinking, but to disregard all sources
of information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own
pet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing
your theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and
the government.

Actually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately -
both testamony by the survivors and IR tape showing the fire
being set in 3 places AND the petrochemical soot that the fire 
was giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the
fire).  

You might not believe 1 or 2 if you are totally paranoid or very
skeptical, but my 3rd point is visible to anyone who watches the
tapes of the fire and has started a BBQ grill.

Did anybody notice it is the TREASURY DEPT (The FBI and BATF, in other words)
that Clinton wants to do the investigation?  In other words, investigating
themselves?

He sure didn't seem very enthusiastic about Congress doing the investigation,
I notice:  ""... well, they can do what they want...""  (Probably insert

>spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.  

       The ""used to kill"" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one
of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.
What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people
read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation
which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or
a tragic accident, especially involving a child.

       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority
of that 43 ""times"" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone 
intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,
the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as
comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural
factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.
(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There
people jump off buildings.)

       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime
is commited by ""non-strangers,"" which mistakenly has been generalized
regarding the King County study to mean, ""Friends and family.""  That
is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on
the mental image that a ""Friend, family member, or child,"" equates
to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of
anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,
children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by 
someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun
was used against a ""friend"" or family member doesn't mean they
weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among
poor urban families, and those are also the areas most ""at risk""
for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may
not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
kid might.

       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I
worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly
self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.
Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous
amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.
As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
means of determining the success of such a defense, since according
to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report
defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders
killed.

       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a ""friend
or family member"" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense
which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in
businesses.)

>Studies by the 
>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.""

       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I
will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that
culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.

       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what
it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural
lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the
exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws 
would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are
remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session
with the press (Part 2 of 2):

     Go ahead, Sarah.

     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The
first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not
have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance
because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was
very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived
without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't
those people have a right to practice their religion?

     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their
religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had
violated federal laws, any number of them.

     Q  What federal laws --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't
answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the
whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they
were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but
it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of
the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of
this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were
speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that
the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have
escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.

     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground
compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be
sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if
the children were not released immediately outside that the humane
thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace
where they could be protected.

     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned
yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas
was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks
themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they
all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a
nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.

     MS. MYERS:  Last question.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --

     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked
Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you
learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your
mind during those horrendous moments?

     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had
considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --
and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the
public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that
the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues
concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would
be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in
the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were
right or wrong, of course, we will never know.

     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the
building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate
concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were
escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.
That's the first thing I wanted to know.

     Thank you.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a
Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't
have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't
go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I
take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I
signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to
make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had
elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,
if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.
And I do support her.

     She is not ultimately responsible to the American
people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an
appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as
well as she could have.

     Thank you.  (Applause.)

Folks,

Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal
carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled ""Armed Force.""  I
felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat
that ""A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.""  I sent
the following to the WSJ.

-----

Gun Stats & Mortal Risks

Preston K. Covey


	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~
2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns
in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King
County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more
likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to
kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it
has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated
by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of
the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping
firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 
 
	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of
bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: 
What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither
the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the
risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control
do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of
cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the
risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful
here. 

	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us
off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a
misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice
and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far
outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your
car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or
an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not
take the bus?  

	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company
of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at
stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:

	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the
number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense
(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed
by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation
is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other
cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12
accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided
by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King
County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of
homes unaccounted.

	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on
six counts:

	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or
acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and
neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is
that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,
dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,
but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are
relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the
calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless
Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is
criminological hogwash.

	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs
populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories
-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited
by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities
like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is
very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but
avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with
histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and
certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious
risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as
ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither
gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or
vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver
crucially affect the risk. 

	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is
that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill
than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of
personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike
Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43
times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this
particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about
whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by
tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question
begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any
case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal
instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths
are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility
obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by
gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to
NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. 
People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their
homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection
course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and
sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death
as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard
and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they
disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and
other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we
resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose
norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign
us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in
the matter.

	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the
NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,
including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total
death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other
studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from
homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these
suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true
that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously
true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these
suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of
research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is
wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce
L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,
1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of
Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of
the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to
~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the
causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a
profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally
disregard this issue.

	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable
rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the
NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. 
But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled
self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case
dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of
justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story
on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women
who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,
1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic
cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were
reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported
that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In
Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error
by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged
by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 

	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation
are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The
divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not
aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even
shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the
coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy
is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure
the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as
opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or
deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where
no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed
to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the
compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by
criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,
Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?
	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are
based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is
high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare
better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance
or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year
by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and
accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable
statistic than the NEJM scare stat:  

A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or
other crime than to kill anybody.   

	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;
what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We
should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation
of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. 
Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by
uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we
can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we
hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.

I have not made up my mind about Waco, but there sure seems to be a group of  
devoted government following fanatics willing to believe whatever that  
government wants to tell them, without any shred of doubt, nor thought of thier  
own.  They sure get shrill whenever their belief structure is being shaken.

Kinda reminds you of the BDs, doesn't it?

Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File 303?
Does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?

From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on CCW.  If S 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then I would
be inclined to oppose it.  I don't believe off-duty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians.  If law or policy prevents law-abiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
officer be treated any differently.

Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation
for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern,
found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.

Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they
just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.

Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and
counter-clockwise swastikas.

Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. 
They remember being ""relocated"" by the US Army, and don't intend to
do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for
weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better
from strangers.

First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and
erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.
Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of
the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the
writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.

Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.
My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend
to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.

Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-
nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss
would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both
organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,
Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar
to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks
of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary
but are probably similar.

Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodied
citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-
two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National
Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The
National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.
It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion
of this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itself
but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this
date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing
as anything but a Federal reserve force.

Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized
Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other 
States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as
a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and
senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill
on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once
a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our
State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an
organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will
come from the unorganized Militia.

In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order
the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will
first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either
its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the
event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law
provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the
unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by
law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia
of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State
does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such
a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use
of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. 

It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being
the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.

Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole
representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have
chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist
end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can
be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that
the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia
or ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-
ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to
provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,
and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,
""terrible and irresistible"".

These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation
of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress
Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear
Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.
These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-
ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.

The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the 
Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting
wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The
Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by
the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the
War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States
territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional
authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal
Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until
WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.
When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new
member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were
""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individuals
refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the
Federal Courts.

Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to
members of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional
history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when
The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's
definition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between the
French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped
drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.
Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors
who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because
their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not
be so bold.

Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is
not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton
nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government
and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing
of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their
responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the
Constitution.
 
Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one
error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The
Constitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of War
in time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States from
maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not
understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.
Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the word
described a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel with
three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has two
masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping
the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's
equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.
""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.
Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. 

In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being
personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia
as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently
both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on
their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or
scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.

Not necessarily. If the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due
to the heat, a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.
In fire aftermaths, bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort. Medical Examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes. 

As such, if the body had been suitably cooked, a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death, or much later, unless you were trained to look for the
evidence. Texas Rangers are not pathologists.

The question is HOW MUCH.


One state (don't remember which, Texas??) tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy ONE gun each MONTH. Think you all know what happened.....

I respect the right to defend yourself, but that right should not inflict on
other people.

It seems like you all realize that you have a problem in America, the only

This is about the third person who's parroted the FBI's line about the

CNN reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their
heads.  However, I have no information on the possible causes.

This is not to say that Government stories are to be taken at the face value in
this case, but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of
embarrassment in the future.  Let's be paranoic, this may be a ploy to smoke
out the opposition and decredit them.  :-)

Comparison of this incidence to Tienanmen Square is made in soc.culture.china. 
Just in case you need more ammunition to shoot at each other.  :-)

I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy

and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been

And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any

The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of
their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_
successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will
filter this so that the general public will think the BD's

Comments, corrections, suggestions, welcomed.

****************************************************************************

Editor, 

I would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to
the ""right to keep and bear arms"", and to a greater degree, the many other
""rights"" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 

1.	You're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  You
call the police.  How will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while
you are waiting for the police to arive? 

2.	You are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  A ""good
samaritan"" stops to ""help"", when you find you and your family at gun-point or
knife-point.  How will you defend yourself?  And your Family? 

3.	You are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  A man appears
suddenly with the intent to rape you.  How will you defend yourself?  Are you
strong enough to fight off your attacker?  Are you willing to let this man rape
you in order to survive the attack? 

If the House and Senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep
and bear arms, as provided by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. A gun
may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going
to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to
defend yourself and your family? 

Many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If
certain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm
ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law
enforcement departments.  Very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition
for use in your handgun. 

There is already a 15 day waiting period in California.  Do you really feel
that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for
the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?

Our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,
or in a moments notice.  You should have the right to protect yourself   while
waiting for help to arrive. 

There is currently legislation circulating in Washington that would prohibit
the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  One
elected official even wants to repeal the Second Amendment! 

I want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected
officials decided that they should only belong to a ""certain church"", or go to
church on a ""partiular day""?  What if you were told that you could only read
certain books?  Write about certain subjects?  What if you no longer had the
right to a jury of your peers?  How about the right to assemble in a peaceful
manner? 

These are all rights that are provided by our Constitution and the Amendments.
If we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  If you do not fight
for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  When your life
is affected?  Write your law makers now!  Protect all of your rights by
defending your Second Amendment rights.

Subject: BATF & FBI Do Right Thing in Waco
Lines: 44

Everyone is complaining about the debacle in Waco. It is hard to 
understand all this angst. What happend there is nothing less than
what we wanted to happen. Why all the sour grapes ?

BATF was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending
budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big
commando raid is proof. It would have been ever so easier to grab
Koresh and his central followers as they shopped in Waco. Alas, no
propaganda value there. 

The FBI screwed-up big time, all the time. They should have never allowed
the situation to drag out like that. A quick second assault, before the
BDs could decide on a strategy, would have been the better plan. 

The BDs themselves were the biggest screw-ups though. They imagined
that US law and US law-enforcement had no jurisdiction within their
little 'country'. WRONG ! They had no right whatsoever to fire on
the BATF, and if they mistook their identity initially, they should
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. If the
BDs had a problem with the warrants, they take it to court, just like
the rest of us. If they wanted full-auto weapons, they could have
obtained the proper permits, just like the rest of us would need to
do. What they may NOT do is decide for themselves what US law applies
to themselves and which does not. They get their chance like the rest
of us - at the voting booth. 

If the BATF and FBI have become latter-day Gestapo, then they have
become that way because WE have desired them to be so. We get to
vote on laws, and on the lawmakers. By our choices over the years,
we have approved the creation and form of the BATF and FBI. When
the FBI was out chasing 'pinkos', the general public didn't seem
to mind a bit of extra-constitutional activity. When the BATF is
raiding militant black organizations, we don't mind the heavy hand.
When the FBI is dicking around with the rights of potheads, the
public doesn't mind. Suddenly, when we see a bit of ourselves in
the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies, we get all bent out
of shape. SUPRISE ! You reap what you sow.

Waco was an encapsulation of the All-American experience - religious
fanaticism, militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. Don't
blame it on 'them', the FBI and BATF. They were just acting within
the parameters we have set over the years. We made 'them'. We ARE 'them'.

	My god, a sane person!  Somebody asking intelligent questions rather
than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to Nazi
Germany.  I question, along with others, the initial raid by the ATF.
There are some definite questions needing answers.

>1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at

	Probably.  Which is why there are so many people angry at the
initial confrontation.  Why attack a compound with as many people in that
compound who are willing to die for their leader?  Further, they attacked
in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  That
was rather stupid...

>2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

	This I doubt.  While I question the ATF's initial raid, I believe
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
exception of the psychological ""warfare"" by blaring music, etc.  I think
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.

>3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action?

	See above...

Just want to make a comment on this.  If you live in this country long
enough, you should realize the media is no friend of the govt.  I am
only concerned about fact that the media like to jump to conclusion
before the facts.  But I am sure they are good in digging dirt as
well; afterall, they like the controversial events, which of course
make news.

Well, I don't normally like to quote myself, but I just got some

and the person there informed me that it's actually just a second

Because most of the children were with their parent(s). Do you understand

	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space
limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to
those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at
what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the
endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental
flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault
rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has
only range and acurracy going for it.

>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to

>to home will not accomplish this.

	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word
would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this
is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians
intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The
balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.

	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy
weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low
numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior
weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.

	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman
tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders
from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,
though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
therefore be jointly maintained and operated.

	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control
over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that
the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,
I would have to assume that State control would rest on the
authority of the Governor and militia officers.

	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
people with government support.  Just as you argued above that
the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this
situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that
the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.

	We have to assume that there would be those who would
side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the
tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.

>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds
>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and

>
>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, 
>general militias.

	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to
outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to
call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
than anything else.

>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of
>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to 
>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry
>arm of the regular army.

	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think
main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff
of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units
in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.

	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light
stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the
states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,
the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for
other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a
very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
for these functions.

Not to mention that the G-men believed the children didn't have gas masks.

But that was not, with respect to the children, the point of the gassing.
The feds *knew* that the children's health would be in danger and proceeded
under the assumption that the ""motherly instinct"" of the Davidian women
would remove them from harm's way. I busted a gut on that one.

Someone else on the net observed that the administration's appeal to a
woman's ""motherly instinct"" would never wash with feminists and liberals
if a republican were in the White House. I say that such an justification
could *only* come from a feminist mindset. 

BTW - I'd read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was CS2.
The paper didn't provide any specifics about it.

Posted for L. Neil Smith by Cathy Smith


                         THE LIES OF TEXAS

Okay, what have we learned?

For reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known 
-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative 
committees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard
of the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and 
personal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the 
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to 
the Constitution. 

The man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw 
agency's minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own 
losses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his 
electricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside 
world. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in 
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency 
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit 
eager to gain credit for ""straightening out the mess"" -- and, more 
importantly, to script his side of the subsequent ""negotiations"" 
any way they please. 

The impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time 
four L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a 
single individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. 
Armored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers 
using scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious 
records at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive 
those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority 
will mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean 
Communists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). 

Finally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising 
of the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house 
and gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and 
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, 
including those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. 

Spokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the 
President all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: 
blame the victim. 

He had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a 
secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being 
""examined"" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children 
-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. 
He set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in 
3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that 
Jim Jones? Best of all, he's dead -- he can't say a damn thing to 
embarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was 
severed at the start of the whole travesty. 

A leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe 
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow 
responsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever 
know 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn't this sound 
more like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? 

Very well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never 
forget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and 
rightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency's admission, 
it was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which 
may explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage 
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) 
about the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a 
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. 

More importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who's been a quivering tower 
of Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance 
as Bill Clinton, it's time for fundamental changes, if not in the 
system, then at least within yourself. 

On March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of 
the Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw 
agency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised 
in its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both 
agencies involved in Waco. I'm proud to say I was there and helped 
to write that plank. 

True, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in 
1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone 
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their 
behinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what 
happened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, 
Waco never would have happened. 

Think about it. And think about the fact that, if you've had enough 
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding 
power -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human 
life -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe 
the change it's time for within yourself is to make the LP less 
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

Think about it.

firearms, I wouldn't want my membership dues funding efforts to get him
re-elected.

     I have other problems with the NRA (as an organization; the individual
members I've met have been loyal, trustworthy, honest, brave, etc.,
especially my boss who probably reads this newsgroup B->); they are
definitely pro-hunting, and I recall seeing a pro-Desert Storm NRA bumper
sticker. Sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena, which
contributes to their reputation as ""bad guys"" amoung many people.

 FBI Director's Statement On Waco Standoff
 To: National Desk
 Contact: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Press Office,
          202-324-3691

   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- The following is a statement by 
FBI Director William S. Sessions regarding the Branch Davidian 
incident in Waco, Texas:

   ""I had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening.
After very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought
that today's efforts by the FBI to bring the Branch Davidians out of
their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the
stand-off or at least meaningful negotiation.
   ""Instead, we are faced with devastation and death.  However, I
have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with
extreme professionalism and care.  I applaud the restraint shown by
agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire, and I thank them for
risking their lives to try to end this peacefully.  I have only the
greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all
involved.""

Yeah.  We don't want to spend too much money preserving lives, after

As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used
against gun owners by the mass media.

However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,
free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40
or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.

Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished
teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been
very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices
interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but
feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members
of their family keep guns at home.

Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:

(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases
    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.

(2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to
    be viewed positively by the public and the media.

(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
    gentle introduction to firearms.

(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun
    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.

(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,
    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate
    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun
    students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think
    about"" with regards to personal gun ownership.

(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.

Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety""
class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also
teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.

I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
gun buy-backs.

So what.  We think you're pretty hilarious too.

I love how you Brit's kiss royal arse.  That you're willing to throw
out freedom-of-speech for the sake of protecting the reputation of the

That the British government advertised in American newspapers ""Send A Gun
to Defend a British Home -- British civilians, faced with threat of
invasion, desperately need arms for the defense of their homes."" during
WWII.  [American Rifleman November, 1940]

That The Obscene Publications Act and the Misuse of Drugs Act have been
used as justification for the police to seize masterpieces such as William
S. Burrough's ""Junky"", Hunter Thompson's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"",
and Tom Wolfe's ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"".  British courts have
never recognized the right to assemble or to demonstrate.

That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.

That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.

That suspected terrorists must prove their innocence, instead of the
government having to prove their guilt.

That the secretary of state may issue an ""exclusionary order"" which
bars someone from ever entering a particular part of the United Kingdom,
such as Northern Ireland or Wales.

That the BBC banned Paul McCartney's ""Give Ireland Back to the Irish""
as well as John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance"" during the Gulf War.

Yes, England is very very funny.  And very pathetic.

So what.  Laughter is a way of dealing with things we find uncomfortable.

Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement.
Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive
decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the
weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things.
(Can you say ""neutron flux""?)  Plus these things have no self-
defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration
(translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that
for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live
requires some sort of launch vehicle . . .

I can't speak for the organizations you cited but everywhere you look in
our society and government, one can see the relentless movement toward
one world government.  The fact that the media demeans such charished 
values as patriotism, nationalism and protectionism are some of the
clues.  The fact that we are sapping the economic strength of americans
to prop up a former and possibly future enemy is just another.  The fact
the words like community of nations, global village and international
business are in vogue are others.  International corporations are 
destroying our identy and economy and the propaganda they are playing
through the media and government is over powering our ability to resist.
Our porous border both people and trade are an indiciation that we have
already lost a great deal of sovergnty.

The bottome line is that the single most evil aspect of One World
Government is that you have nowhere to run to and history has proven
that would be a disaster.

I'd like to point out that I was in error - ""Terminator"" began posting only 
six months before he purchased his first firearm, according to private email
from him.

I can't produce an archived posting of his earlier than January 1992,
and he purchased his first firearm in March 1992.

I guess it only seemed like years.

So, like, what do you do during those six months to be ""active?""
My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before
you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.
Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?

Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental
disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the
government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some
trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you
are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.

> It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
> You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US 
is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun
owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.

Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There
are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but
only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot
of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.

Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring
safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But 
they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't 
fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence 
to those with political connections.  Is this fair?

Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.
Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed 
carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage
over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,
then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.
Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for 
these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.

Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other
people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals
affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this
during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts
NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that
the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to
possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens
who have lived good lives as if they were just ""pre-felons"" waiting to
commit crimes.

Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,

drive drunk, drive without it!

However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.
I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.

The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's
whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.
I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.
I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning
one, too.

The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins

crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, 
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV

Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent

Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.
Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being
worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they
thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to
put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and 
concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable
of moving.

Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the 
things that the FBI said (""The BD's started the fire.""  ""The BD's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds."") that are now being refuted by the 
evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make
them sound like fact.

Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop

on numerous occasions.

And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until
they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If
the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be
dead today?

Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after
the initial raid on the BD's.  ""Coincidence?  I think not!""

And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince
the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by
the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to 
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the
building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to 
cover its ass.

	SeAL Team six should have handled it?  Delta Force?  The
BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have

in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do

	And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF
has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons,
and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing
more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an
oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document
that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should
be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's
the whole reason for any of this.

Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private

We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and
usually only two candidates for a given office. A President
might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create
a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)
and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the
civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote
for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter
of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York
and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to 
create a virtual ban.

>Guns 'n Criminals:
>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.
>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.

In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:
According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals
legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's
the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing
guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish
this.

>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!

How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for
owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,
target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.

>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,

I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation
of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,
in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.

>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect

A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal 
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems? 

>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.
In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those
where guns are less common.

This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government

vague ""common good.""

In the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start
that, I know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted
the FBI.

The FBI said they found some folks who had been shot in
the head, and the medical examiner said ""we have not seen
evidence of this"".

At the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing
with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like
typical medical examiner not releasing details until
a thorough investigation.  The medical examiner saying
he hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying
that it isn't there.

While it might end up being true that the FBI had spoken
falsely, it isn't clear yet that they have.

Brent shows his ignorance once again.  Power had been cut for weeks.  And he's  
never lived in a rural area if he thinks electric stoves have favor there.   
They stop working when the power fails, and power restoration come MUCH slower

I think the is BZ gas, not CS or CN. BZ gas exposure results in projectile
vomiting, loss of essentially all muscle control, inability to concentrate
or think rationally and fatal reactions in a significant fraction of
the population. For that reason its use is limited to military
applications.

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that
David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the
first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't
they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or
similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.

Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I
don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this
so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""
looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,
dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the
cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.

What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the
compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,
or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the
rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the
ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if
you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.
Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents
used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

They were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a
shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.

Snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  Besides,
the ranch house (not ""fort apocalypse""; it was just a house despite what
the FBI and ATF says) was on *fire*.  The ""Gun loonies"" couldn't hardly
have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.
The FBI and ATF don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there
to put out the blaze.  The bastards waited until the fire was *well*
under way before they called the fire department in Waco.  They didn't
even tell the fire department to be on standby.  I sincerely hope that
the FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in
this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.
Someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.

Sadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media
and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it
up as being solely David Koresh's fault.  Sadder still, the American
people will probably believe them.

This is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that
is becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns
*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On
the other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal
guns then the government did have the right to search their compound.
But, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons
hasn't been proven yet, so I'm not going to conclude that the BDs broke
any laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this
is his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can't be justified.
The ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol
violations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should
stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of
their jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.

Sounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults
alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are ""heavily-armed
religious wackos"".

David Koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out
peacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON
THEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
this senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE
LIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.

Don't be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the
cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that
it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on
fire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions
of committing mass suicide.  David Koresh's lawyer also confirms this.
Therefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED
EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still
don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the
Waco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.

You're wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They
had MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic
pistols but not all were.  The ATF's initial claim---which they later
retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.

Gun control isn't the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in
Washington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then
they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns
me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government
seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are
becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  This
greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.

Certainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was 
talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely, 
there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.

compound in 1992.

I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press 
in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy 
of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family 
would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.

The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee 
a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took 
to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was 
first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.

For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly
and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws
of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in
the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with 
was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so
clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If
I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
in court (""If it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would
ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"")

In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence
he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of
that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen.

	That really depends upon where you draw the line while defining
these weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of
modern practice five months or five centuries down the road.  I'll give
you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the
road?  In the USA, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in
nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate
the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  So,
where do *you* draw the line?  In the USA, the EPA has ruled that
a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  Care to draw a thinner line this time?

Yeah, and at least one person ran back in. SOunds like a personal choice to me.
Religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs,
is probably at the core of what happened in Waco. We in the west tend to
disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many Moslem fundamentalist groups
who see nothing wrong with dying for their beliefs/convictions. I suspect that
this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the BDs. BUt we'll probably never
know...

Nope - that doesn't happen.  Instead the switch (among those who
change behaviors) to property crimes.  That's an improvement even if
the economic take is unchanged.  Sure - not everyone switches, but
they were killing before.

What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored
transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to
do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed
more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. Look
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
of ours.

With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with
mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few
women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn
to death 51 days later.

  If they had been quiet there would have been no deaths??  I thought thier
neighbors said that the Davidians never bothered them.  Oh, well, that couldn't
have been your point, then.  

  If they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the ATF wouldn't have felt 
threatened and had to move in.  Here's a newsflash:  It isn't illegal to
own more than one firearm.  It isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.
 
  They shot federales?  The feds shot them, too.  

  How about that staying inside thing?  Here's another newsflash:  sometimes
the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.  Since
they were so nice to the Davidians the first time round, I can see why
the Davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were
expecting the end of the world.

Organization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)
Distribution: na

Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about
the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).

1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?
     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're ""in committee"".
     How close is that to being made law?

2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important
   differences I missed?

3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:
  A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established,
     but not before).
  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving
     using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected?)
  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an
     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.
     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement.
True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?

4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from
   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?
   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?

   'Seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed
   (e.g., ""John Doe owns N guns"").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun
   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.

Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the current
legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits
of any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.

To establish the right to obtain firearms for security, and

    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
  
        This Act may be cited as the ""Citizens' Self-Defense
    Act of 1993"". 
  
    SEC. 2. RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY, AND
        TO USE FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF SELF,

        (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHT. -- A person not pro-
    hibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm shall have
    the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use fire-
    arms in defense of self, family, or home.
  
        (b) FIREARM DEFINED. -- As used in subsection (a),
    the term ""firearm"" means a --

        title 18, United States Code);

    that begins with the date the violation described therein
    is discovered.

Well, this sounds good to me.  The key is Section (2)(c)(2), which
will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks
who can't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall.
All of you who've been saying ""hey, isn't that illegal?"" could just
go hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win (""contingency fee"")
basis, and sue the bums ...   :-)

What you can do now:

(1)  Write your Representative, and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1276.

(2)  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett, the sponsor --

        Representative Roscoe Bartlett
        312 Cannon House Office Building
        Washington, D.C. 20515

     -- to tell him who your own Representative is, and that you've
     asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR 1276.

(3)  Contact Gun Owners of America --

          Gun Owners of America
          8001 Forbes Place
          Springfield, Virginia 22151

     -- which has committed to lobby on behalf of HR 1276.

(4)  For those of us with a RealJob (TM), find out how to reach
     Representative Bartlett's campaign fund (I'm working on it)

Exactly, after all he was in the same party, probably just didn't want the
bad press that being directly associated with Duke would bring.  Conversely,
is his disdain for David Duke supposed to make us ideolize him?  I mean
a stand against neo-nazism ... Whoa!  Now that's progressive!  Come on.

I certainly know that I would refuse and openly denounce my Vice Presidency
if it meant putting him in control.

	Dont you believe that the Branch Davidians committed suicide for one

	If alcohol were again banned today, it would be MUCH more
	difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation. 
	The cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
	in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.

	In a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into
	this country has greatly decreased. This is because its
	value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or
	heroin. It's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.
	Now, most reefer is domestic. There is less pressure on
	the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and
	thus it is economical. Of note though ... domestic reefer
	is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.
	You cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a
	good dollar/pound deal. 

	Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.
	It would not be economic to smuggle them in. All production
	would have to be local. There are not all that many people
	who have both the skill AND motivation to assemble worthwhile
	firearms from scratch. High-ranking crime figures could
	obtain imported Uzis and such, but the average person, and

The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start
violence.
 
When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.
But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for
their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical
attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.
 
If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as
hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they
had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening
chips for medical attention etc.
 
A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one
has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent
that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they
could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their
fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It
appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking
ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but
they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.
 
All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the
BD.

Some of us suspect that ALL the unlawful mistakes made on Day 1 were made 
on the government's end.  That makes days 2-51 nothing but a macho

Who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit ""opinion poll"" of ""most 
Americans?""  Most Americans swallow the government line that they're fed --
not because they're stupid, but because it's the only line they ever hear.

""Most Americans"" thought the staff at the McMaster(?) school was guilty,
guilty, guilty.  Woops, turns out they weren't.  ""Most Americans"" once
thought that black slaves weren't human beings.  Woops, wrong again.

Title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply.  241 is conspiracy (two or
more persons) against rights of citizens.  242 is deprivation of
rights under color of law.  Both call for up to life in prison if
death occurs.  Reno, Bentsen, and Clinton are probably all principals
to the crime (as they are responsible for authorized actions on the
part of their subordinates).

You forgot one detail, they should be turned over to the Texas
authorities for trial, as the crime was committed there (Article 4,

The government will be overthrown *long* before that happens.  A *huge*

of the Armed Forces will turn against the people that they are entrusted
to serve?  Not hardly.  You can count on a lot of people in the Army,

They will unless they are idiots.  They will realize that if they don't
then they will be *next* including you.  Believe me if what you describe
happens they will be coming for *more* than guns.  Disarming citizens
would require that everyone's cherished freedoms and liberties be
suspended temporarily.  More likely, they'd never be restored unless the

 These stats are invalid; we're talking BACKCOUNTRY. These stats for
 rapes/assaults/deaths do not represent the backcountry singularly; the
 great majority represent urban incidents. You should have pointed this out.

In Massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but
if you convince the cops/DA that you used lethal force because
of threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges
would probably be dropped.  If you run away and are later caught,
then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury
of your innocence.  Going ""on the lam"" is seen as an indication
of guilt by a lot of people.

how so? i think you're making assumptions here that might not

revolvers are just as effective, if not more so.

wait, doesn't Chicago have -serious- gun control? if so, why do the

all the patrol cars i've seen around here have shotguns clamped to 
the dash board. IMHO, that's all the police need to outgun just about 
anything.

 Dennis Deconcini, 1982
 
...In these and similar areas, the
Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5
U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by
administrative bodies.
   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-
committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded
rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United
States.
   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise
of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-
ing and seizing private property.
   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property
without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-
out regard for their right to due process of law.
   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was
utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the
Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities
were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-
gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to
be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently
made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-
tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before
BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence
was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF
gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither
criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into
unknowning technical violations.

                        WASHINGTON : 1982
 
 
Letter to Constituent: April 1993
 
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.
 
It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which
funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly
professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.
The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in
successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use
of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It
enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory
minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an
illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in
preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk
youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known
gangs from access to weapons.
 
The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF
on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession
(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs
and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to
trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where
they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF
is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with
state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state
and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office
felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally
establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and
thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members
of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a
Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would
be separated from the women and children and not in the area where
it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.
 
As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh
spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending
execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the
element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and
prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation
presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the
FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military
tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and
firepower of the Branch Davidians.
 
Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian
raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply
saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who
attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the
cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a
thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside
the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for
Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the
Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the
evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick
and peaceful conclusion.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dennis DeConcini

Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith

                           WEIRD SCIENCE

Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips 
move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are 
politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase 
""political science"" is subject to more than one interpretation.  

Years ago, we heard how ""scientists"" were worried that a new Ice 
Age might be coming, and later on that ""nuclear winter"" -- smoke 
and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international 
unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even 
have killed the dinosaurs.  

What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, 
that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended 
to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken 
values that made America the most successful culture in history, 
and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague 
when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  

We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William 
Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't 
supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 
100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never 
know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit 
their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and 
that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  

But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of 
science as they are of everything, they trust ""scientists"" to 
unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's ""scientists"" 
have agendas of their own.  

Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is 
going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that 
there is no respectable evidence for ""global warming"".  The money 
and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and 
they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical 
crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  

The same appears true of ""acid rain"", a deliberate hoax cooked up 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private 
industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and 
foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on 
specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  

The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  
""Ozone depletion"", for which evidence is even more suspect and 
contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than 
a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era 
when state central planning and the command economy have failed and 
can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  

Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth 
and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear 
power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy 
known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount 
of energy there is available to any individual in society, the 
freer that individual -- and his society -- become.  

Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and 
self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as 
ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive 
reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have 
been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  

And what the media didn't say about recent EPA ""discoveries"" on the 
effect of ""secondhand smoking"" is that, although some harm to non-
smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of 
magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a 
week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether 
there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  

That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically 
correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice 
to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy 
practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's 
science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is 
highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet 
the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There 
isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of 
government money on the scientific establishment.  

Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies 
to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one 
time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and 
religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has 
tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of 
abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street 
-- has wound up being shed.  

Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's 
lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of 
livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, 
to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels 
for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, 
when they die from the effects of obesity.  

What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two 
more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of 
state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; 
real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will 
simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and 
everyone will benefit.

 there is any reason(s) why I should NOT support the following
 Bills, other than the previous comments about S.458.  Just checking
 before I mail the letter to make sure I don't support something
 that I really shouldn't.

 -----------------
 I strongly SUPPORT the following laws currently being considered in Congress
 as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime, or re-
 enforce our Constitutional right under the 2nd amendment.

 * S. 441 (Campbell)	To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a
			mandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession
			of a firearm by a convicted felon, a fugitive from
			justice, a person who is addicted to, or an unlawful
			user of, a controlled substance, or a transferor or
			receiver of a stolen firearm, to increase the general
			penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws,
			and to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the 
			possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of 
			violence or drug trafficking crime, and for other
			purposes.

 * S.458  (Smith) 	To restore the second Amendment Rights of all Americans.

 * S.488  (Specter)	To provide Federal penalties for drive-by shootings.

 * S.504  (Kohl)	To amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code to
			make it a Federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives
			in interstate or foreign commerce.

Anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one.  If you carry
any pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going off
are about zero.  Unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a couple
of minutes or put it in a fire. :-)

Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun 
militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how ""well regulated"" 
modifies ""militia"" is:
	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, ""wet""
	modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""

The amendment is similiar to the statement:
	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep
	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.
So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,
what does the ""unorganized militia"" have to due with the right to
own guns?

No not, unconditional, but ""shall not be infringed"".  Infringed
is defined as:
	To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, 
	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
	To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
This definition implies the following of some form of existing 
agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries 
or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word 
""unconditional"" implies no agreements or all previous agreements 
are off, which is the opposite.

The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
""congress shall make no law,"" are much stronger.  They clearly 
	         ^^^^^^^^^^^
imply ""unconditional.""  If the writers of the amendment, wanted 
unconditional whay didn't they says, ""congress shall make no 
laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms""?
The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
the people from forming a ""well regutaled militia.""  The duties
of a ""well regulated militia"" to the government are descussed in 
Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control
of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II 
Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.

Ever hear about cutting off the electricity? That was done.
How effective is an electric stove then?

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control
laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think
this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987),
their line made so much sense -- only people who ""need"" guns should be
able to get them, and the people who ""need"" them are the police and
other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional
and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position
basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me,
folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with
hunting or other ""legitimate"" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical
governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they
can't protect you).

Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I
simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to
lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but
explaining exactly how an ""evil"" semiautomatic weapon really works
does wonders).

I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective
against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to
realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the
oppressed and the terrorized.

     You forgot the part about encasing it in a small shaped charge so that
if anyone tries to tamper with it, it explodes and kills you.

	For the record, it wasn't until I came to college (excluding

ever removed the keys from the ignition of my car!  Come to think of
it, it was only after I moved to Ames, Ia (pop 45K) that I ever took

	I've discovered that $50K/year isn't worth living in fear
all day.  I might just move back to the farm.

	This weekend is Veishea.  You know, when ISU students riot
for no apparent reason.  This year, we've the Farm Aid concert
to add to the festivities.  Anybody bet me there's another riot?
Remember, Iowa law has three guys talking loud defined as a riot.
Stay tuned for an on-the-scene report this weekend.

Indeed.  Larry King had the two attorneys (whose clients are now
dead) of Koresh and another Davidian on his show last night.  Their
discussions with the survivors differ from the FBI account.  The
attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
in the compound which started the fires.

Government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other 
throughout this whole affair.  I'll wait for some better evidence before
I form an opinion.

Murderous, huh?  Yeah, there was all sorts of carnage going on there in
the 60 YEARS they were there -- BEFORE the government assaulted them.
Oh, I forgot -- you probably consider self-defense as murder.

Damn right.  This is not a partisan thing; it's about individual

Maybe they said:

""Our appropriations are coming up soon.  We need a good PR boost.  Let's
find a socially unpopular group who happen to have a lot of guns, go in
like gangbusters, be heros, and have the local media get it all on video

Now we know that Kratz doesn't understand what a safety is supposed to
do.  (He also confuses ""things he can see"" with ""things that exist"";
Glocks have multiple safeties even though only one is visible from the
outside.)

A safety is supposed to keep the gun from going off UNLESS that's
what the user wants.  With Glocks, one says ""I want the gun to go
off"" by pulling the trigger.  If the safeties it has make that work,
it has a ""real"" safety, no matter what Kratz thinks.

  Yes, I think so and it has been reported as such.  Seems like a cowboy

  The answer is probably YES. But consider; what was the WORST thing that

been any worse that what DID happen.

  But that statement of taking full responsibility is totally meaningless.
What are the consequences for being fully responsible for this disaster?
A note in your personnell file??  Slick already called these people a bunch
of crazy people and dismissed the idea she should resign.  Doesn't take 
ANY balls at all to take the responsibility.  Hell, at that rate >I< will

As William O. Douglas noted, ""If a powerful sponsor is lacking,
individual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and
resounding constitutional phrases.""
 
The legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee,
committee, and floor action.  Many important victories, however, come
from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting
legislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted.
These quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our
fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.
 
  ****
 
Arizona - SB 1233, NRA-supported legislation concerning minors in
criminal possession of firearms  passed the House 36-18, is currently
awaiting action by the Governor.
 
Arkansas - HB 1447, Firearms Preemption Legislation was signed by the
Governor making this the forty-first state to pass preemption.
Preemption had passed twice in previous sessions only to be vetoed by
then Gov. Bill Clinton.  HB 1417, mandatory storage of firearms,
amended and then killed in committee.
 
Colorado - SB 42, mandating the storage of firearms with a
trigger-lock, killed in committee.  SB 104,  prohibiting the sale of
certain semi-auto firearms was killed in committee.  SB 108,
so-called Colorado Handgun Violence Prevention Act, including a
provision for a 10-day waiting period, killed in committee.
 
Connecticut - Substitute Bill No. 6372, imposing a 6% tax on all
firearms, ammunition, and archery equipment killed in Environment
Committee.
 
Florida - A bill to require a 3-year license at a cost of $150 to own
or possess semi-automatic firearms with a second degree felony
provision (15 years in prison) died in committee along with numerous
other anti-gun owner bills.  No anti-gun legislation passed in
Florida this year.
 
Georgia - SB 12, supposed instant check with provision allowing for
up to a 7-day ""waiting period,""  defeated in House Public Safety
Committee and sent to Interim Study committee.  Mandatory storage
bill -- SB 247 -- was defeated 39-15 in the Senate.  The same bill
passed the upper-House 52-2 in 1992.
 
 
Illinois - HB 90, prohibiting the sale, possession, manufacture,
purchase, possession, or carrying of certain semi-auto firearms, was
defeated in House Judiciary II Subcommittee on Firearms. HB 91,
mandatory storage legislation, failed in House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Firearms. HB 1550, repeals FOID and makes FTIP, point of sale
check permanent, passed out of Judiciary Committee by a 10-4-2 vote.
Presently on the calendar for third reading in the House.
 
SB 40, mandatory storage bill, defeated in committee.
SB 265, imposing a handgun excise tax, failed in Senate committee on
Revenue's Subcommittee on Tax Increases.
SB 272,imposing a tax on all persons engaged in the business of
selling firearms, failed in Senate Revenue Committee's Subcommittee
on Tax Increases.
 
Indiana - SB 241, Statewide Firearms Preemption, passed in the Senate
34-16, and in the House 77-22.  Twelve amendments were introduced on
the House floor to SB 241.  Among these amendments were a ban on
certain semi-auto firearms, Mandatory Storage, Trigger-Lock, a ban on
""Saturday Night Specials"" (Similar to 1988 Maryland Bill), and
Handgun Rationing (one handgun per month).  All were defeated.

	[I read this morning (4/20) S.B. 241 was defeated -- lvc]
 
Kansas - HB 2435, providing for a 72-hour waiting period on all
firearms was defeated in committee.  HB 2458, presently on the
Governor's desk, HB 2459 and SB 243 and 266 all relating to victims'
rights, are expected to be enacted into law.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determined
efforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April
6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in
Madison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban --
aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on
the issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place the
referendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to
reverse public opinion on the controversial issue.
 
An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found
57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  By
election day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,
51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to
have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign
committee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,
relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV
advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications
raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.
 
Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madison
initiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to have
the Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

""We"" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on

are many, many bad things going on in that area.  Also, I have several friends
that live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these

that only minorities have gangs?  Not so.  As far as the quotes are concerned
it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  I
don't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by
taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  If
you would have been there Andy it would've been obvious to you too.  Of course
it might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there, I live
here and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough it
becomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One last
thing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find these
things out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do
so.  She is nice enough to let me know these things so I can watch out for
myself as I live right on the border of the west side of the city. Enough said.

You can't think of any valid reason to own a gun that can't wait?

Either you have a very limited imagination or a strange definition of
the word ""valid"".

Here are a few reasons you might want a gun *right now*:

You're a Korean greengrocer in LA and a riot has just started in a
nearby neighborhood.

You've received a death threat.

Your SO has just broken your arm and you fear for your life if you
stay with him and he's said he'll kill you if you leave him.

A psychopath is breaking into people's houses in your neighborhood and
robbing and killing people inside.

A violent mugger is operating on the route you have to take to get to
your night job.

There are lots of dangers you might be in that won't wait for the
waiting period for you to purchase a gun.

If anybody wanted proof of the nonsense of the ""you can't build guns"" claim,
they need look no farther than the Philippines.  Amateur gunsmiths there
regularly produce everything from .45 automatics to full auto shotguns.  Now
if this guy wants to claim that the Philippines is either technologically
superior to the US or that their transportation is better than ours, all I
can say is that he's living in a fantasy world.

  This strikes me as a tad ingenous.  ""If X had done/note done Y, then Z would

actually committing the act, not on those whon ""forced them to do it"".

  After all, to take an extreme example, if the British were not in Northern
Ireland, the IRA would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers.

The BATF is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  If they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the IRS does...call in the
federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type
assaults all the time.  And they are very, very good about it, in both the
tactical and legal parts of it.  But I suspect that the marshalls would
not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed I
believe) was so bogus.  

Besides the BATF also could have gotton SWAT teams from: federal marshalls
service; FBI; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby
large city police forces; the military.  But they had to use their own
guys, nobody elses SWAT team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
control.   

	I also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
Initial raid: two days before the NJ senate was going to overturn their
""assault weapon"" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the BATF's budget
was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after Reno got
confirmed as AG (I don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);
right around the presidents 100th day in office.   As a wise man once
said: once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy
action.    I don't believe that these four things are conincidental.  Do
you?

Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the
BD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly
crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the

then the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be

Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the

This will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi
basin-- of the Southwest-- of Mexico and South America-- who converted even
before there was such a thing as the US.  Are you saying that Indians are
incapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without
being forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were
given the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the
Cherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy, since they themselves
owned black slaves.  No, reducing it all to a matter of religion is to
support a much too narrow view of history.

I've never heard of a single treaty, whether broken by the US government or
not (were any NOT????), that said, if you guys convert to Christianity, you
get to keep all the land you claim.  No, treaties were invariably about land...
it meant ceding Indian claims to the government.  Sometimes in return the
US government promised the hunter-gatherer tribes (and plenty of tribes were
already farming for centuries, but we don't hear about non-Plains Indians
in movies) food and training in return for taking up a non-nomadic existence.
Promises, of course, which all to often proved empty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for
NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear sir:

By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication
of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of 
momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.
Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however
meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists.

The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:
A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying 
editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees
of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular
order.

	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to 
	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting
	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that
	contention.
	
	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very
	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,
	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities
	are very different with very different demographic characteristics
	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white
	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-
	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various
	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.
	
	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,
	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all
	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-
	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth
	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM
	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving
	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that
	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that
	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?
	
	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national
	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because
	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which
	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?
	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite
	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide
	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as
	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado
	Springs. (Ref. 3)
	
	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in
	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending
	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is
	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry
	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in
	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of
	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun
	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number
	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns
	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns
	legally for protection, registration figures are
	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York
	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,
	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population
	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver
	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.
	
	The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun
	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity
	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own
	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a
	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is
	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking
	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide
	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in
	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in
	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-
	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and
	Vancouver.
	
	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and
	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that
	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian
	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more
	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually
	the case.
	
	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain
	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the
	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 
	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a
	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number
	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making
	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest
	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences
	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,
	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social
	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,
	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention
	most factors related to crime control.
	
	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not
	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost
	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from
	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the
	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be
	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors
	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides
	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle
	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
	involving firearms.
	
	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,""
	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied
	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly
	handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly
	be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or
	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent
	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding
	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25
	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,
	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while
	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure
	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, 
	announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough.
	It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be
	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.
	
	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC
	make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific
	breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating
	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying
	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight
	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about
	the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,
	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call
	for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside
	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize
	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

                             GUNS AND SPUTTER
                            by James D. Wright
          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)

      Someone once wrote: ""Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is
   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated
   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by
   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal
   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and
   suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a 
   community.""
      The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,
   Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite
   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver
   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations
   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems
   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period
   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.
   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,
   Why?
      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,
   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their
   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and 
   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support
   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody
   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We
   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that
   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.
      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two
   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-
   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons
   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the
   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.
*     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands
*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index
*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in 
*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage
*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.
*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,
*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take
*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be
*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides
*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general 
*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To
*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of
*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.
      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that
   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.
   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,
   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.
      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of
   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the 
   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin 
   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke
   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.
      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in
   many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law
   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish
   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all
   else is equal"" among things being compared.
*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look 
*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime
*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage
*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle
*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.
*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the
*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-
*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown
*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.
*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is
*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates
*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide
*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.
*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due
*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,
*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics
*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison
*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial
*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle
*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain
*  in either city.
      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the
   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority 
   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""
   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why
   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed
   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,
   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)
      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between
   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have 
   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol 
   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city
   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the 
   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the
   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian
   percentage?
      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many
   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent
   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part
   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such
   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.
*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide
*  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing
*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They
*  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important
*  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks   
*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of
*  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article,
*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle
*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial
*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,
*  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race
*  is not available for Vancouver.""
      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in 
   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms
   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one 
   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.
   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce 
   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
   account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are
   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city
   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the
   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very
   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities
   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,
   and their results are impossible to interpret.
      In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying
   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the
   authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public
   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are
   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this
   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical
   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--
   is cause for further concern.

This is quite corect, but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy
will show virtually no deformation, ie a hollow point probably would not
expand, an FMJ would be ""pristene"".  Also the bullets will not be marked
with the lands ang grooves of a barrel, because they didn't come out of
one.  A good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.

Let us hope that the  ME's that handle these bodies are more competent
then the ones who did JFK's body.

That's right.  Despite claims that someone at Kent State fire a shotgun

sent in the direction of the soldiers were rocks.

Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting

Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.
Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To
extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years
practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one
(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of
training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.

Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?

Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been
taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.

In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?

I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only
a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.
Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become
civilized with?

Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first
and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,
whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal
liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but
I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd
hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke
""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after
World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

       Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them
both, though.

       As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than
the national average, I would expect it is a result of a much higher
suicide rate.

       Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to
have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others
harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large
group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's
appropriate.

        Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw
a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have
something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which
to punish an individual.

        Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?

        Cute analogy. 

        The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However,
we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate
*all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal
system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property
confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.
That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of
murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.

Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, 
the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds
surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the 
fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a 
great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove
burning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm 
is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas
was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start
burning until around 10:00 or 11:00.

Calm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave
that compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.

There are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggested
that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. That's not such a wild

I'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but I've never
thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or
competence. I just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that
can't wait a few days. I can think of plenty of bad reasons for not
wanting a waiting period: I want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right
now, I've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and I can't
afford to spend the night here, etc.

I'm not a big fan of guns, but I feel that it is important to guard
American's rights to own them. On the other hand, we license and regulate
many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights.

Now, unless you have an agenda against private ownership of firearms, why would
you want to harass the person trying to legally defend themselves or exercise 
their rights? (I know, defending oneself/family/whoever IS a right... at least
as far as my 9mm and I are concerned... ) (Also as far as the State of Alabama
seems to be concerned)  Why don't you push for stricter prosecution of those
who use firearms in the commission of a crime?  I've already pointed out how
we aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries
seldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work..
Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've
historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,
while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the
European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite
language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and
then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain..
But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to 
restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while
they forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes
these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to 
convey... I'm glad my Amer. Hist. teacher was a Libertarian who had us review
a good portion of the Federalist Papers, and debate their origins and meanings.

Does anyone really believe the Swiss have had no war within their borders
because every adult male owns a rifle? I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but
500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. Can you
picture Hitler, with Panzers and Focke-Wulfs poised on the border, losing

Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on
force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able
to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers
sure as hell didn't, either.

Maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about

This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough.  Good.

I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic
nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of
people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or
cropland.  


Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals.

I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions.

It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are
banned for other reasons.

Perhaps I wasn't sufficiently clear.  I was NOT accusing YOU of being

This statement simply amazes me!  ""Through no fault of ATF, the element of  
surprise was lost""!  What element of surprise?  In the paragraph preceding this  
one, he said ""... the special agents announced who they were and their purpose  
for being at the compound"", which was to serve the federal warrant.  No element  
of surprise was even needed for that.  

No, the element of surprise that they lost was that needed for a preemptive

The FBI released large amounts of CS tear gas into the compound in
Waco.  CS tear gas is a fine power.  Is CS inflammable.  Grain dust
suspended in air can form an explosive mixture, will CS suspended in air
form an explosive mix? Could large quantities of CS have fueled the

I believe we still remember Masada, where Jews killed themselves rather
than being captured by the Romans.  While I do not agree with the
Davidians, I must admire their willingness to die for what they 
believed, which Jews have had to do often.

You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten
things out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replace
guns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC
seem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.

Guns are really ""old"" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one
is motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with
some real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get
us moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff
that's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.

Remember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossible
feats if we are motivated enough and I think ""self-defense"" is high on our
list of motivators.

They ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of

That's open for debate.  Certainly, an excessive number of people are

Re: More on Gun Buybacks

The Denver buy back, trading guns for Denver Nuggets tickets was pretty much
a bust. Very few guns were turned in. The news tried to hype it but 
when the best they could do was "".... including a loaded .38..."" well,
you get the picture.

A side note- the news also reported that the guns would be checked for
whether or not they were stolen. STOLEN GUNS WILL BE RETURNED TO THEIR
OWNERS!!!!! (They say)

  Which one?  The one yesterday, or has there been another?  If it was yester-
day, catch up.

  IMO, 90% of all ""conspiracy"" charges are easily explained by the simple
fact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission, all kinds of
stuff gets said when people really just don't know what the hell's going on.
Then the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of ""its all a 
whitewash!"" start.  Naturally, everybody wants to cover his/her ass.

  Damnfino.  I just tend to take issue with absolute statements that are ob-
viously wrong on their face and tend to inflame, not inform.  The isolation

       Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is
sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what
do you base this?  

       And given that smuggling channels are already established,
and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly
more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering
doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than
drugs?

       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.

       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw
ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and
out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even
have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  

       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed
to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of
every ship which came through.

       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how
much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood
of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.

Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that
the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that
effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best.
With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and
tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls
were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely 
plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it
intrinsically less believable than the government stories.

Indeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that

the fire started.  A tragic accident, if true.

See above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe
we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  My view is that,
from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is
completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding
citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution.

	What a load of crap ! The BDs had absolutely NO RIGHT to fire
	upon the BATF agents. If they didn't know who they were at
	first, then they should have surrendered immediately when they
	did realize who they were dealing with. Little groups of loonies
	do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey
	or what sorts of warrants are justified. Like the rest of us,
	they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal
	wants are not backed by the majority of voters, then too bad.
	If they wanted to keep automatic weapons, then they could apply
	for the proper permits. If they had a problem with the warrant
	then they get to argue that in court. In no event do they get
	to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend
	that our laws and law-enforcement personel have no jurisdiction
	within their borders. You live on US territory, you live by
	US laws - period. (unless you are a congressman)

	Sure, the situation was handled badly by both the BATF and
	the FBI. It would have been all so easy to detain Koresh and
	his core members while they were out in the streets of Waco.
	The BATF, threatened with budget cuts, was trying for a
	propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big
	commando-style assault is proof of that. They should be
	roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. On the
	other hand, they DID have the legal right to do what they did.
	Once the attack was begun, they should have pressed on and
	finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that
	take root. 

	The FBI also used poor judgement in a number of ways - but again,
	the laws we voters have approved, or the lawmakers who created
	them, gave them the right to do what they did. If BATF and
	the FBI are latter-day Gestapo, it is because the voters have
	allowed them to become that way. Waco was pure Americana -
	militarist mentality, religious fanaticism and unadulterated
	violence all rolled into one experience. We get what we pay

The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article
on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal
tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.
type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,
and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.
The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student
(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...

(The title was the only thing they changed/added)

""Gun Stats""

The Daily recently reprinted an article from the
Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton
Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,
in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The
article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This
is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-
eral reasons, outlined below:

The study gives the impression that, if you own a 
gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to 
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you.  The study, however, fails to take into
account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun 
to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-
trator.

The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every
month, the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a
friend.

The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample 
size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-
stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.

Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-
erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be 
used, successfully, by a private citizen against an 
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a 
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.
Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies 
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can 
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-
rate conclusion from them.

Rember, Korash didn't get to sort this all out, serenely typing at his
keyboard.  He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being
ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,
its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at
that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear
of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have
you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under
that pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate
what is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law
enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For
all we know, he was informed by someone saying something like ""Hey,
guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you...""

According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said
the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around
$200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).
Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a
drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced
decent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably
has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is
an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,
nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note
that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what
is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad
for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming
the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?
This administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.
Whether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,
it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.  Can you say 1984, only 10 years late?

Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort
to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was
the chain was regarding the tanks ""last used in Detroit in 48"".
The text follows.

:  You did not merely claim that
: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
: sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  

Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say
I had been told they did fire their main guns.  
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: You continue to
: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
: disputing.

Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks
post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  

: ""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you
: now going to admit that you were wrong?

That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?
   --------------------------------------------------
  ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns
to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""
   --------------------------------------------------

  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.

  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:
  --------------------------------------------------
>We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. 

Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it
was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions
it in his song ""Black Day in July"".
  --------------------------------------------------

  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that
means I was right.  

: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
: been *big* news.

   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. 

: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
: it. 

   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
assert that I claimed they were truth.

: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
So it would have been an Army cover-up.

   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer
: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
that they did fire their guns.

   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
account I cited.

 That thinking is so screwed up, I don't even know how to respond to it.
A rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt
to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.????????????????
So this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease
LESSER CAUSES such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease,
chronic lung disease, homicide, HIV infection, or diabetes.  Oh, okay Charles,
that makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I'll call the Heart
Foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES
of death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.
Please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.
 
I've got an idea Charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents
group or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don't
confuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many
victims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don't agree.
I'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of
childhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
is trying to make a political issue out of it.

 Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
for your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually
in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed
concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane
person and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined
as ""a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
number of childhood deaths.""  If that is the case, I'm extremely glad that I
am inhumane and irrational.

Sorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting
the facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, ""Firearm murders
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990""
 
Is the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state
that ""Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
accidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded"".
 
Or how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say ""Gunshot
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
between 1987 and 1990.""
 
Do you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state
that ""Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from
1986 to 1988.""
 
Charles, I hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don't
realize this fact, (I don't care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go
into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll
by yourself), I'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
discussion.  I really don't want to do that.

 Charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.
They don't just study cancer and heart disease.  I've got news for you,
interpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.

Charles buddy, I'm getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet
Mars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don't come into contact
with many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition
spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard
gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,
whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and
whether they themselves have ever been shot.
 
Believe me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.

|What will Californians do with all those guns after the Reginald

The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining
about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the
government. Rather like having your janitor complain about job
conditions.

I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage
in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based
on the ""nefarious tipster"" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco, 
Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city
streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down
with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass
BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be
enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war
operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton
would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt
to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge
with a 500-man ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" and the FBI would attempt 
to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian 
National Guard to level the area with artillary!

Well, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall,
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that
a 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent
accident.

Maybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time.
What if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know
about the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in
sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds?

Cripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop

Wellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened 
anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons
and hardware.  And as far as ""evidence"", what are you talking about?  
Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get
questioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage

killed 'em all 51 days ago"" don't feel that way, but then you're probably
one of those people still saying about Klinton ""Give the guy a chance, we don't

Not in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns)

4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots
of them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.

Hmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally
don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked
the Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie.
Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs
during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the
timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW
that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are
trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing
on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is
the case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did,
and this time, people are just paying more attention to it.

funny, if Koresh did say that, he was quoting St. Paul. of course, 
the early Christians were persecuted too. if Koresh is a loony 
because he quotes the Bible, how long is it before mainstream 
Christians become the target of the FBI's loving care and attention?

Really?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd
really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college
students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
daytime?  

Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is
locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and
nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was
in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.

What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault
for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she
didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the
case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and
pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all
situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.

\begin{quote}

NOTICE:

The Denver Post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy
or sell assault weapons.  The Denver Post finds that the use of assault
weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers.

\end{quote}

Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However,
the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the 
attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.  

I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure. 
According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said
the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I 
strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.

I don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality.  The
right mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second
Amendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment
RKBA, and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal
court system.

OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you
know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.
You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed
individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family
against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I 
better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do
what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you 
defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your
door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to 
charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that
you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological 
warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up
and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still
holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using
tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that
you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest
round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as
cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through
the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created
by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.

I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with
the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to 
surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency
committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted
search warrant.  

Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements
regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered
trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire
which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now 
playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of 
Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses
by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been
held off in their assault.

Gun safety classes sound good in theory, but they kind of remind me of
the ""literacy tests"" used in the bad old days to keep blacks from voting.
They came with the ""grandfather clause"": if your grandfather could vote,

When did Koresh go on a rampage?

What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th.

Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion
to anything reasonable.

And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled
believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe
Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack.

I suppose they also believed things like:
""I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget.""
""We don`t need to lead with a tax increase....""
""It starts with a middle-class tax cut...""
""I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll
have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history.""
""I will ask congress for a line item veto..""
""I will lift the social security earnings test..""

I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves
right, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than
50% chance of being right about my first guess!

Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens
and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

As Tom Jefferson said:
""When all government,..., shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of
all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government
on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government
from which we separated.""  (1821)

I heard over NPR yesterday morning that Arlan Specter, Senator from
Pennsylvania, has already called for a Congressional investigation.
The problem is that Specter was one of the key government attorneys several
years ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations
of JFK and others.  That is to say, the Chief Fox wants to check out
the hen house.  Writing your representatives is a great idea.  When
you do ask that they keep Specter and his cronies far away from 
any investigation.

[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]

I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and
clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.
I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,
followup to t.p.g.

1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get
   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I
   was told by a police officer.
2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to
   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns
   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.
3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will
   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.
   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form
   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  
   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these
   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will
   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess
   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.
4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will
   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations
   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some 
   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.
   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)

This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory,
do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.

As I recall, in the 60's the Kennedy Administration had sub-kiloton
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Europe and destroyed.  They were man-
portable and made for use in shoulder-mount rocket launchers.  The
smallest nuclear test I've seen data for was a .1 (yes, one-tenth)
kiloton weapon tested either in the late 40's or early 50's.

The Swiss population is (and well was) far larger than that. I think
your question should be, ""...losing sleep over a million expert
riflemen?"" Certainly he could have conquered Switzerland, but
a million armed militiamen (especially in a mountainous area, 
where tanks' effectiveness is limited) would have made it a
real pain. The question a conqueror would ask, is ""is it worth 
the trouble?"" The more difficult an invasion is, the more likely
the answer would be ""no."" Certainly a million riflemen (as
opposed to a professional army of only ten or twenty thousand, the
best a country the size of Switzerland could support), makes
invasions more difficult.

>Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this

Really? In 1939? I'm not even sure you could prove that today (despite
the steriotype.) Certainly the Swiss bankers were not essential
to the German war-time economy.

I watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press  
vantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank  
punched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the  
whole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.  Faned by the 30 mph gusts, and the  
Hueys.   If there were other fires started, they were not visible, nor were  
they needed to cause the flame progression I observed.

...and I'm sure that people who were big fans of fuedalism pissed and

Times change, technology changes, viable forms of social organization
change. While concerns about preserving Western notions of civil liberties
in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one, it's
a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide. It's much smarter to focus
on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are
acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms.

Look, I don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,
but they're not anything like your Caloric gas range.  It takes about
three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards 
you can't just ""shut it off"" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 
hours even after you choke it COMPLETELY.

So it ain't exactly ""light up the stove and cook me a batch of them 
pancakes, Aunt J...""  If you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for
heating your house at night, you will have it lit to SOME extent all 
the time.  Trust me on this one, I speak from experience.

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this
approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_
(i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.
The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.
You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits?

There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,
because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor-
General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the
whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
shooting.

Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating
food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from
hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much 
freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
the supermarket).

By ""cannot now be justified"" I guess you mean that you personally

Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any
votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing
and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the 
incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.

Funny, Brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the ""facts:""

1) What the government says.  This includes what the government says that
   two survivors have said.

2) What Koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,
   including what he says that most of the survivors have said.

Strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.

If anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.  I may have missed it.
But my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case 2, and not at all like case 1.

We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the
misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because
they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use
in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set
against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer
would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress
a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no
longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people
will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contrary 
to what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.

Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discovery
of uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothing
to do with the issue at hand.

Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really
expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based
more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which
are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their
Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends
are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions
on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the
contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world
more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They 
would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how
society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They 
support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum
who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society
or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun
control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun
control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they
have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront
the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that
are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't
accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making
significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly
hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different
tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.

More than someone who would not release children from the compound.

I.e., more than David Koresh/Vernon Howell/""Jesus Christ"".
I saw lengthy excerpts from an Australian documentary made in 
1992 that clearly showed that this was a cult.

I am not pleased with the BATF handling of the affair.  I think they 
bungled it badly from the start.  But I don't think they are 
responsible for the fire, which started in two different places.

The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It
has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that
tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  You continue to
back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
disputing.

Awesley went on:

  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was

  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's

  Tonia Blanding, age 4.
   
        ""When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction
  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the
  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front

  of the side of the apartment.""
  
       Well, it's not the main gun.  

""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you

  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American
  cities in the Sixties.

Awesley replied:
    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to
  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main
  guns.

I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
been *big* news.

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

And on:
  I don't
  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and
actually
  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know
  what you find.

I already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used
F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you
believe me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research
it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?

If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
it.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 
If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer
to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

What sources did Sauter and Hines use?  In Congressional hearings
later, the newspaper folk admitted that their reports were completely
wrong.  (Some of their excuses are understandable, while others amount
to gross negligence.  Then there's their ""we lied"".)  As far as I

I don't have any relevant knowledge about the counter-sniper tactics

they did.

Not in Detroit, not during the 60s.  That's newspaper copy and they
admitted later that they were wrong.

As I understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get
any closer. Surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting
for themselves. I haven't noticed CNN being banned from Baghdad
hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise
missile land in the lobby. Incidentally has that ever been explained
or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course
missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about
1 in some very large number?

Unsafe for who I wonder?

Relay of coverage seen:
----------------------
There was a press conference by authorities at the compound on CNN earlier 
today (Wednesday).  It was explained that two news photographers were found 
on the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained 
to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer 
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous 
by a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  

The two photographers were said to be currently in jail and 
the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.  
It was also emphasized that the survey of the ""crime"" scene at this 
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.
The press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the 
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  

That is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my 
memory.  I bring this up because I haven't seen anyone else note it 
and I haven't seen the regular newscasts mention it.  It will 
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.

My opinions:
-----------
I find this disturbing.  While I believe that Koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity, I find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

Since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are 
already dead, the emphasis on the importance of building the court 
case seems overblown to me.

It will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair.  I have also 
heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government 
enforcement agencies which you will recall I have stated would be a good 
idea in previous months.

Please also note that I by no means endorse  or agree with the many 
conspiracy-type theories I have read here and in other groups.  As usual, 
I am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered 
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility, IMHO.  As such, 
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

Well, like someone said in a reply to this it really all depends on the area
that you live in.  See David Veal's reply to this.  I have heard exactly the
same thing that he said in his reply - to fade away if you think that you
haven't been seen (I heard this from a police officer).  For the record though
he was talking about in Tennessee - not everywhere.

Will do! I appreciate the thoughtfullness of the Post to not be an
intermediary for such sales. The ""Right to bear arms"" is one of the most
misapplied rights in our Constitution, and assault weapons go way beyond
what is, or rather should be (imho), a ""natural"" right in America. Just
ask the family of that boy shot back in September - the papers are full of
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a ""angelic face"" (Post)
who committed the murder without ever thinking.

I keep hearing this, and while I'll agree that he ""should"" have come
out (legally, that was his best option), he didn't; and as far as I know,
there is no legal provision for ""we're tired of this shit, lets just

So I have a question for you; here goes.

I come up to you and point a gun at you, saying ""I'm going to count

You believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation, so
you don't do it.

>> Do you know how many deaths each year are caused by self-inflicted gun-

There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year.
The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500
fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those
occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of ""self-inflicted
gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters"" is probably
well under 250 per year.

>>If you fall, for example,
>> and land on the handgun or cause a sudden blow, the gun will discharge.

Handguns designs have included a ""hammer block"" since around 1960
or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates
the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun
cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and
is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,
modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or 
in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) 

>> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of
>> deaths caused by animal attacks or ""wacko"" attacks combined.

I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders 
each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only
2.1% of the murders were killings by ""wacko""s, you would be
wrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated
assaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and 
preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the
accidents you are worried about.

(These figures, by the way, are from the FBI's ""Uniform Crime
Report"" for 1990. I'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at
the ""National Crime Victimization Survey"", which is more
specific about where and when the crimes occured.)

Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.
After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided
that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant
posting.

*** file follows *** 

Hi Folks;

As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it
kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.

Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other
legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things
start today.

More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen
Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands
trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)
Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting
because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)!

The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim""
who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the
guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he
expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver
and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop

Look, folks, I don't know what happened in Waco.  I do not claim the BDs are  
angels, I never did.  Koresh may very well be the devil incarnate.  I just  
don't know.  But I do know that I must question any single source of  
information, such as we have here.  And I must question even harder given that  
it is single source at the insistance of that very government.  What ever else  
happened at WACO, that is perhaps the biggest evil done.  And even more so in  
light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the  
state officials.

But what I really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government  
worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong.  They  
are fanatic to the point of making things up, such as Brent's microwave oven  
disclaim of the BD's using fire for food heating.  

I am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power Koresh  
held over the BDs, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those  
rapid apologists.

First of all let's assume that you are right that fewer guns would make it 
in to the country, that sounds great (to those that see guns as inherently
evil) except then every one  of those guns would be in the hands  of someone
who obviously couldn't care less about following the law, after all they 
got the gun illegally, so is more likely to commit a crime with that gun.
Great then everyone with a gun is likely to use it in a crime, nice system.

Now  as to reducing the number of guns  coming into society by making it 
illegal to manufacture, sell, or import them in this coutry,  let me use
a parallel for empiric evidence.  The amount of cocaine in this country is
far less since its manufacture, sale, and importation was out lawwed.    If
that last statement is true then perhaps we should consider your plan.  This 
could also apply to drugs in general.

Obviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.
In brief, you can't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.
It stays on all the time.  It even stays ""on"" for over 24 hours AFTER you
shut it off (which is why most working woodstoves aren't ever ""shut off""
until spring).

...

This is taken a little out of context and I'm not flaming Jason...it's just
that this was the proverbial straw....

I grow a little weary of the allegations (here, the media, people on the
street) that the BD's had all these ""horrible illegal weapons and other
paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air...""
and then, without missing a beat, discuss how the BD's willfully commited
mass suicide, or killed their own less fanatical and *then* commited mass
suicide, etc., etc.

If the BD's had all these things and intended to ""blow up their abode, blow up
Waco, blow up the entire country, or whatever suits your fancy, what happened
to all the violence they were supposed to unleash? Why wouldn't they have ""gone
out in the proverbial blaze of glory"" and ""come out shooting"" with an attitude
of ""let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us""?

Instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
store for them at the government's hands.

It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followers
of the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, or
whatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
their beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to ""you
and me"". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.

My conclusion at this point is that the ""authorities"" seriously misread their
danger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chose
this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up to
and including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.

Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
they perceive as the godless government. When I force myself to not judge
others by my own personal standards and beliefs, I can almost admire their
stand.

I surely believe in the Constitution but I don't know that I have such strength
of conviction as evidenced by the BD's.

No reported has ever sued the government for such a situation.  They know the  
dangers.  Remember, the BATF invited the initial coverage. And how about a  
simple, remote-controlled, camera or two?  There were ways to provide media  
access.  The FBI obviously just didn't want any.

I can find several.  Tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the

from the FBI, keeping them pinned in?  Who knows?

That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between
Hollywood's ""Old West"" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks,
saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the
thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that
this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who
insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while
they really did care when thugs preyed on others.

We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work.
Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation
is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used
criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine
guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about
guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other
guns.

Because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives,
tire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in Switzerland
each year and 850 homicides, total, in England. That's three
times worse per capita in England than in Switzerland. Since
dead is dead, it really doesn't matter that 60% of the Switz
murders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the English murderers
do.

We've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in Waco but the brainwashing
of the general population never ceases to amaze me. Here is an
example of action being taken which results in the worst possible
outcome and despite people's deep intuition telling them something
is wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the
agents probably acted in good faith. NO THEY DIDN'T. They either did
not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted
knowing the risk. Sums up human stupidity all over and one of these
days it will destroy the fucking planet: ""Oh sorry. Didn't think they
would respond by launching a strike. All our best calculations told
us they were bluffing.""

A friend recorded CNN news during the gassing and incineration of
the BD's.  I went through it carefully today, and found something
very interesting.  A tank is pulling out of the house, and there
is a fireball, maybe 24"" across that lasts for about 1 second.
Exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts
billowing out of that area of the building.
Now, I'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a

No, you just miss the point.  By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a  
total failure.  New York's total homocide count, with it's strict gun control,  
is MUCH higher than Rhode Island's, with it's less strict gun control.  FAR  
more folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.  Therefore, according to  
Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  
Rhode Island.  Remember, it's ""Nitpicking"" and ""a whiney debating style"" to  
point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat  
my argument.

It certainly is provable.  Around a million Americans every year defend
themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even
have to fire a shot!  The mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the
deterrent that is needed.

I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the
right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent
crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable
to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will
be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing
the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling
guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic
incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns
should be banned by the Klintonistas.

See my previous post.  That ought to set you straight.

People have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the
Constitution says.  That means that even if the 2nd Amendment is
repealed the *people* (that's all American citizens FYI) will *still*
have the right to keep and bear arms.

I guess what I am really asking, like I did above, how does my government
who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what I can or cannot possess?

It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less
""criminal"", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. I also would seem
to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm
or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there 
would be specific penalties for doing such.

""Widely reported"", eh?  Remember, this has had a news blackout since day 2.
The FBI is the single, sole, source of these rumors.  It may be the truth, but

       Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being
supposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back people
an ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.  

       As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it would
depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is
on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd say
certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who
they gave money orders out to.

>Is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?

       There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebody 
brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of ""buy back""
programs.

Apparently needing to clarify his comments from Thursday, Dr. Nizam
Plawaby (spelling?), the Medical Examiner for Tarrant County, Texas,
who has authority in the Waco deaths, stated that since no autopsies
had been performed, there is no evidence for bullet wounds, or 
evidence against bullet wounds.

Janet Reno also stated that she had never been told of bullet wounds
by anyone in the Justice Department.

Even a simpleton knows a baseball bat is considered a deadly weapon. 
If one cannot run away (e.g. old, infirm, even middle-aged if the
assailant is younger), a handgun is the most effective means of
defense. You won't even have to fire a shot 98% of the time.

Any real streetfighter (and there are LOTS of them), with or without a
knife, will kick the living sh** out of most people ""trained in
unarmed self defense"".  For the majority of people, a gun is the most
effective form of self defense.

One more time.

It ain't about duck hunting.

It ain't about lone perps on lonely streets.

It's about DEFENDING OUR RIGHTS from the *GOVERNMENT*, which 
has seen fit to ignore history and attempt once again to take
them from us.  They WILL SUCCEED if we don't do something NOW.

That's why I think the NRA is a bunch of WEENIES, because they
have FORGOTTEN that fundamental fact.

Pardon all my shouting, but there seem to be a whole helluva lot
of people on Condition White, fat, dumb, and happy, sucking that
glass teat for all they're worth.... Wake up and smell the cordite,
gang, they're shooting at us, and it's high time we shot back,
at least with our keyboards.....

No, they didn't have electrical power, but no, I don't find the idea of
Davidians calmly cooking lunch with gas masks on as the FBI knocks the
buildings down very credible,either.

It's not like this whole discussion is relevant.  It started when some-
one made the wholly unsubstantiated allegation that the wood stove ig-
nited NAPALM the FBI shot into the buildings.

I'm not a groveling apoligist for the feds, far from it.  But wild ac-
cusations like this are ridiculous and obfuscate legitimate criticism of
their conduct in this whole affair.

No it's not.  If you would have read my other post I was accurate.  Here's what
I said:

[material from another post]------------------------->  The other point that I
would like to make because I know it's true (looked this one up in the Illinois
                  this is for you Andy-----> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
statutes before) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in Illinois.
^^^^^^^^ <------ Also for you Andy.

And then I went on to say:
There is no such thing as a CCW for us ordinary folk here.
[end of quoted material]

Of course I forgot to mention who ""us ordinary folk"" are so just for Andy I'm
going to go to the library tomorrow and photocopy the part of the Illinois
statutes with this information and post it.  Ordinary citizens CAN NOT get a
license to carry a concealed weapon.  There are very few people who can.  I
even asked my lawyer friend about this and he told me that only certain people
can get licenses for concealed carry.  He couldn't remember which people but he
knew for sure that regular citizens couldn't get that type of license.  He told
me to go check at the library for the statutes which I did.  I'll post that
info tomorrow night.  Until then.......

Ahem!!!  Hrumph!!!!  You have encurred the wrath of Glock owners.  We will beat

Seriously.  There is no difference in the safeties betweena Glock and any DA
revolver.  Intellectually, think of the Glock as a very high cap revolver. 
Ignoring stove pipes, misfeeds and all the other bonus exercises that
autoloaders give you, that is.

Every gun has its safe moment and its dangerous moment.  If you just learn how
to handle it, it becomes a lot less dangerous (to you).

The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its

This is the AP story from Fri morning.

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader
David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began
looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and 
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the    
compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.
   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    
since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's 
phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the
cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.
    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel
compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the
women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all
under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    
was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building
it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.
Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to
gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to 
find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The
FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult
members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions
at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,
it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others
died groping in the blackness.

Last time I checked, ""amassing an arsenal"" and practicing any kind of
religion were mentioned in passing in the Bill of Rights.  Guess it's
OK with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing
a bunch of religious nutcakes, eh?

Of all the idiots I run into in daily life, Dan, your type scare me the
most.  You'll accept expediency and a coward's safety over any belief
just as long as the government tells you to.  You assume that anyone who
doesn't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and
therefore bad.  Worse, you seem to accept without question what the
government says is wrong to be wrong.

David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,
methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT
even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe
the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.
You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others
fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned 
from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice
just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go
my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,
either individually or collectively as the great socialist ""we"" has ANY 
RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.

You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound
in order to ""save themselves"".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment
about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if
suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are
beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear
enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically
designed to force you to make that ""forsake or die"" decision?

The ""forsake or die"" option is exactly what the government forced on the
Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that
first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51
when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The
people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who
believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those
people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.  People like
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with ""well they could
have come out"" get my most scornful contempt.  I'd spit in your face
were there not a network between us.  You're not worth the ashes of
those people who burned.

In Texas, it is legal to carry handguns while ""traveling"", and also to and from
sporting activities.           ^^^^^^^^

Chapter 46 of the Texas State Penal Code does NOT restrict long guns.
Therefore, it is legal to carry and transport long guns any place in Texas.

Not just because of the riflemen.  They also have many hard bunkers in

Gee, that's a new one.  He thought it was a different ethnic group.  
Since Hitler was determined to control, at the least, all of Europe,
do you think he gave a damn about international monetary concerns?  
Also, there's a LOT of gold in Swiss vaults.  Don't you think he new
that?  If he could have, he would have taken Switzerland.  However,
crazy as he was, he wasn't totally stupid.  It would have cost him a
hell of a lot to take Switzerland, with no guarantee that an invasion
would be successful.  He probably figured (or his generals did, when
he was listening to them) that it wasn't worth the cost.

  Yes, we do have a beautiful country. And I enjoy it.  Most of all, I

  And I want to thank all of you good folks, like Prescod, who remind me
  of what I have.  Along this line, I watched a documentary on one of the
  Nazi concentration camps.  Stacks and stacks of bodies.  There were scenes
  of Hitler speechifying, and what struck me, was the reverence and adoration
  on the faces of the people in the crowds.  I guess they were happy that
  Hitler had implemented full gun control and was taking care of the Jewish

     There is no such thing as ""completely secure,"" especially when dealing

CNN just reported the ATF and the FBI have begun killing everyone in the
United States. A press release stated this action was required because
bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their
homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday
do something illegal. An ATF spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated
that ""this would clean up things once and for all"".

If the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the FBI has
indicated they will ""burn them, just like we did those kooks in Waco"". 
It hasn't been decided how the new proposed ""energy tax"" will enter into
this, an IRS representative stated ""We're looking at the tax code to determine
if taxes really end at death. With this many dead Americans, we don't want
to overlook anything"". An ATF agent ran into the room, and shot her.

Stay tuned....rich

I'm not a lawyer but to the best of my understanding, the Congress has no
more rights than what is enumerated in the constitution.  That is the 
prime reason why the National Firearms Act is based on collecting revenue.
Since the Congress has the authority to levy taxes, the NFA is a tax act and
the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.
U.S.C 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular
authority granted to the Congress by the Constitution.  Congress can not
arbitrarily ban a substance or product.  That is why prohibition came into
effect, only by passing an ammendment.   What you said about constitutionality
of law needs to be clarified.  I believe that an unconstitutional law was 
never constitutional.  When a law is determined by the Supreme Court, to be
unconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  The very nature of the law
being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  Please correct
me if I'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone
convicted of breaking that law is absolved.
   I don't believe U.S.C 922 has ever been challenged in court.  NFA has been
invalidated in two Federal District Court cases( one may have been appellate
level{ U.S. vs Rock Island Armory  and U.S. vs Dalton}).

  Currently, there is a bill before the Texas legislature that would make it
legal for some ordinary folks to carry concealed weapons.  I don't have the
details, sorry.

Speaking of ME's. The FBI said the fire victims were found face-up
<fire victims, apparently, are usually found face down> 
suggesting they died prior to the fire. The ME says, in a word,
BULLSHIT, the victims WERE face down. The FBI says they sent a body
of a victim that was shot, supposedly by BD guards, the ME
says, in a word, BULLSHIT, the body showed NO evidence of gunshot
wounds. Can the ATF/FBI tell the difference between CYA and truth?

   Some women might say, ""Death"".  How about ""life, with no hope of parole""?

      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to
get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question
quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.

>I HAVE to be licensed to drive.  

      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed
to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.

>My car
>MUST be registered.  

       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are
not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do
so for tax purposes more than anything else.
    
>I MUST (at least where I live) have liability
>insurance on both myself driving and my car (if someone else had an

       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,
only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused 
is not required to have insurance.

>Hmm, wouldn't manditory saftey classes, registration
>of both the owner and gun, and manditory liability insurance be nice for
>gun owners.

       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are
significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*
and *making rules for ownership*.

       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this
have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and
have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are
never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for
a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,
Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun
owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the
numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that
intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of
the next person who comes down the pike with a ""reasonable"" suggestion
they've already seen abused.
