How do you define war?  Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages
count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?
January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold
               1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,
                    after cutting off the supply lines to it.
Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.
By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from
      land links with the rest of the Jewish population.
         The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,
            while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were
            slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.
Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from
     Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side
     of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews 
     had been killed.

Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.
Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?
Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?

That's why zoologists refer to you as a 'fecal shield'. Colonel Semen 
M. Budienny, a subsequent Soviet military fame, said about the 
Armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless Turkish and Kurdish 
women, children and elderly people during his visit to Anatolia 
in June 1919 that

""the Armenians had become troublemakers, their Hinchakist
 and Dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys
 of whatever power happened to be ascendent.""

In September 16, 1920, Major General W. Thwaites, Director of
Military Intelligence, wrote to Lord Hardinge, Under-Secretary
of State for Foreign Affairs:

""...it is useless to pretend that the Armenians are satisfactory
 allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim.""[1]

In the Special Collection at Stanford Hoover Library, donated by
Georgia Cutler, the letter dated Nov. 1, 1943 states that

""Prescot Hall wrote a large volume to prove that Armenians were
 not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would 
 always be unscrupulous merchants.""

Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I 
am writing. By the way, that ""bullshit"" is justly regarded as the first 
instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.
For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived 
on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet 
and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The 
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its 
Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, 
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have 
 been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every

 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate...""

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration 
camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the
short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the 
cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party 
leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by 
this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia
(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it
had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who
could be expected to oppose their plans. 

On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even 
though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over
60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the 
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left 
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few 
Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British
soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. 

Rawlinson wired to his superiors, 

""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control,
 atrocities were constantly being committed.""

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered, have been destroyed,
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the two-year Russian occupation.

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.

 As to the people of these cities:

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people,
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the 
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls
 and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than
 those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,
 horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in
 Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and 
 Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have 
 been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

   Anas Omran has claimed that, ""the Israelis used to arrest, and
sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters.""  The assertion
by Anas Omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  If there is an
once of truth iin it, I'm sure Anas Omran can document such a sad
and despicable event.  Otherwise we may assume that it is another
piece of anti-Israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does
not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  If Omran
would care to retract this 'error' I would be glad to retract the
accusation that he is a liar.  If he can document such a claim, I
would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  Failing
to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted 
and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because 
of race, religion and national origin?

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and 
idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A 
short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda 
and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious 
for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their 
neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely 
within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to 
x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is 
the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary 
heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, 
even lunatic. 

And we still demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide 
and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian 
political pressure.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. 

Now what would you do? 

Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by 
        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when
the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""
    "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it 
without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible 
enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leaving
them to their fate.

The point is that the land was sold legally, often at prices
above its actual value.  It was legal, and good business for
the sellers, though it left the Palestinians who worked the land
in a poor situation.

I don't know if others share this opinion.  It is mine,
and I'm sure there are some who agree and some who don't
The way I see it, the fallahin were caught in circumstances 
beyond their control, in that since they didn't own the land,
they didn't have a say. Of course, now for the sake of the ""greater 
Arab unity"" the Arabs are angry that the land was sold to the Jews
(an act that is illegal in Jordan), but when it happened, it was just 
business.

The purpose of buying the land was to provide space and jobs for 
Jewish immigrants.  In any case, no matter what the purpose, 
the sales were legal, so I really don't see any grounds for 
contesting them.

Mr. water-head,
i never said that israel diverted lebanese rivers, in fact i said that
israel went into southern lebanon to  make sure that no 
water is being used on the lebanese
side, so that all water would run into Jordan river where there
israel will use it  !#$%^%&&*-head.

And we all know what an unbiased source the NYT is when it comes to things
concerning Israel.

Neither the Times nor the trained seals who have responded thus far seem to
recognize the statement that these ""private funds"" were all tax exmpt.  In
otherwords, American taxpayers put up at least 30% of the money.  And
finalyy, how does ""Federal land"" mitigate the offensiveness of this alien
monument dedicated to perpetuating pitty and the continual flow of tax money
to a foreign entity?

That ""Federal land"" and tax money could have been used to commerate
Americans or better yet, to house homeless Americans.

Right now, I'm just going to address this point.
When the Jewish National Fund bought most of its land,
It didn't buy it from the Palestinians themselves, because,
for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),
living on land owned by wealthy Arabs in Syria and Lebanon.
The JNF offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of
it.   It's called commerce.  The owners, however, made no 
provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting 
them by selling the land right out from under them.
They are to blame, not the Jews.

With regards to my condemnation of Marc's ridiculous attacks on the
American Department of Justice, and further attacks on Jews, to
anyone who took offense to my calling Marc stupid, I
apologize for pointing out the obvious.  It was a waste of the
Net's time.  I hope, though, that most American citizens have
the basic knowlege of the structure of American government to
understand the relationship between the Justice Department
as a part of the Executive Branch, and the Courts, which
are of the Judicial Branch.  
Marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his
inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years.

The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. 

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United 
States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative 
Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

Of course posting some hard evidence or facts is much more

any way.  Basil, do you know of any evidence that would support
this?

I can just imagine a news report from ancient times, if Hasan
had been writing it.

Newsflash:
Cairo AP (Ancient Press).  Israel today denied Egypt acces to the Red
Sea.  In a typical display of Israelite agressiveness, the leader of
the Israelite slave revolt, former prince Moses, parted the Red Sea.
The action is estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment.
Egyptian authorities have said that thousands of fisherman have been
denied their livelihood by the parted waters.  Pharaoh's brave charioteers
were successful in their glorious attempt to cause the waters of the
Red Sea to return to their normal state.  Unfortunately they suffered
heavy casualties while doing so.

Dr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally 
be believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing 
Goebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks 
who are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's 
informed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For 
instance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they 
watched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can 
read the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what 
really happened. 

There are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee 
Alumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, 
the Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, 
the Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek 
Men's Lycee Foundation.  

As for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' 
in titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts 
have ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, 
the Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti 
Turkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks
in Western Thrace. Such community associations had been 
active until 1984. But they were first told to remove
the word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down. This is also the 
final verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.

In the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish
parentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment
with no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was
of Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official
was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three 
years. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than 
a vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority 
complex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. 

The Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' 
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference 
to 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the 
existence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the 
essential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger 
Turkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the 
three nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of 
themselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized 
according to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'

It also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece 
and the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.
The Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish
minority. They pursue the same denial in connection with 
the Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,
in 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting
religious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek 
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective
of the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although
the Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in
Greece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders. Talk about democracy.

The government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic 
convention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an 
attitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a 
violation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' 
Greek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection 
of historical monuments. 

The government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new 
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward 
Hellenizing the region.

And you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human 
Rights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by 
the Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation 
of the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, 
Sidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of 
Kefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. 
His employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in 
24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his 
involvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice 
and remains without a job. 

Helsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating 
the plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their 
findings were published in a report titled 

 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'

The report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the 
Turkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, 
the Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in 
Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against 
the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the 
Lausanne Convention. 

The Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik
were attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in
Karotas was razed by bulldozers.

Shall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going 
to take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The 
discussion of human rights violations in Greece does not 
stop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles 
I shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks
in Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.

It has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration 
has an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made 
plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it 
has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on 
conventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek 
and Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned 
to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the 
transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern 
Cyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of 
the agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.

An acceptable method may certainly be found when there
is a will. But we know of various kinds of violent
behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning
of buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were 
dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. 
Shots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.

Now wait, there is more.

  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by
  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,
  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).

  pages 82-83:

<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus
   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered
   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their
   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age
   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst
   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a
   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities
   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.

   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from
   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript
   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.

   3. The two tax gatherers Mustapha and Ali Effendi were killed in the
   following manner: Their arms were bound behind their backs with wire
   and their heads were battered and burst open with blows from the butt
   end of a gun.

   4. During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls
   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers
   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house
   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath
   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.

   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and
   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then
   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been
   no more heard of.

   6. At the market, during the fire, two unknown people were wounded
   by bayonets, then bound together, thrown into the fire and burnt alive.

   The Greeks killed also many Jews. These are the names of some:

  Moussa Malki, shoemaker          killed
  Bohor Levy, tailor               killed
  Bohor Israel, cobbler            killed

  I have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  This
Andi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet
because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you
attack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's
question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only
ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
are the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some
INTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!
{assuming you are also semitic}
	Now I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism
during the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -
off militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of
Palestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
Arabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British
soldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they
massacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing
to the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their
very lives.
	I mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part
Jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
Israelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the
Palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
Jews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for
German and European anti semitism.

There certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
a global Islamic community should be achieved through force. There are, 
however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
former) who *do* accept the establishment of global Islam through force.

approach. Those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
power are certainly a threat.

To Palestinians, Israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
of those *outside* its own ""group"". If I am told that ""I am not one of
you"" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.

I too strongly object to those that justify Israeli ""rule""

Why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  If Omran retracts his ""verbal

would be pointless!  Giving this guy the opportunity to ""save face"" after
uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  I must say

Sinai had several big cities that were avcuated when isreal gave it back to
Egypth, but for a peace agreement. So it is my opinin that the settlers will not
be an obstacle for withdrawal as long it is combined with a real peace agreement
with the Arabs and the Palastinians.

As opposed to Israel's many ways of death. Using bombers and artillery
against Lebanese towns and villages. Using fire arms and lethal
variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone
throwers. Using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5
minute evacuation warning.  Using Shin Bit's ""reasonable"" physical
pressure in interrogation. And more. Not counting of course past 
practices such as the bombardment of Beirut in 1982, the bombing of the 
Egyptian school of Bahr-El-Bakar and the Abu-Za'bal factory in 1978,
the downing of the Libyan airliner full of Egyptian passengers near
the same time. Overseeing the Maronite massacre in Sabra and Shatilla.
That is of course besides numerous massacres by Irgun and other gangs
during the British mandate period.

Ironically the same Op-Ed page in the NYT times from which the Naftaly

Rosenthall blaming Bosnian Muslims for their own genocide by effectively
saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring

DEPOSITION OF VANYA BAGRATOVICH BAZIAN

   Born 1940
   Foreman
   Baku Spetsmontazh Administration (UMSMR-1)

   Resident at Building 36/7, Apartment 9
   Block 14
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


During the first days of the events, the 27th and the 28th [of February], I
was away on a business trip. On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-
work, and left for the Zhdanov District. That's in Azerbaijan, near the
Nagorno Karabagh region.

After the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically
in Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said ""uprising"" in
Azerbaijani, but I don't think it was really an uprising, just a 
demonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the 
Zhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even 
women; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, 
and went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There
were some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the
Armenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.
I was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew 
wouldn't let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really 
bad. I didn't know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,
""There's unrest everywhere, be careful."" Well I had a project going on. I told
the Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on 
and said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn't allow it, they 
said, ""Nothing's going to happen to you, we've entrusted the matter to the 
police, we've warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you."" 
Well, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he 
knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This
man didn't leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and 
afterward he spent the night with us, too.

I sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, ""The situation is
very tense, be careful.""

We finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the
morning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I
shouldn't tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else's
business travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it 
and my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, 
they sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that
they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out 
they knew what was happening in Sumgait.

I arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is
closed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the 
buses aren't running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two
minutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private
drivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, ""Let's go find some other way to get
there."" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to
take us to Sumgait.

He took us there. But the others had said, ""I wouldn't go if you gave me a
thousand rubles."" ""Why?"" ""Because they're burning the city and killing the
Armenians. There isn't an Armenian left."" Well I got hold of myself so I could
still stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we 
set off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, ""In fact there aren't any
Armenians left. 'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them."" Well 
I was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, 
""How old are you, old man?"" He wants to know: if I'm being that quiet, not 
saying anything, maybe it means I'm an Armenian. ""How old are you?"" he asks 
me. I say, ""I'm 47."" ""I'm 47 too, but I call you 'old man'."" I say, ""It 
depends on God, each person's life in this world is different."" I look much
older than my years, that's why he called me old man. Well after that he was
silent, too.

We're approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.
Before we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he
was waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I'm sitting there with
them, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant
there were no Armenians with us.

I look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the 
street, you know, and there's no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They
stopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature 
shafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .

Along the way the driver tells us how they know who's an Armenian and who's 
not. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I'm an Armenian, but I speak 
their language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for 
""nut,"" or ""little nut,"" as ""pundukh,"" but ""fundukh"" is actually correct. The 
pronunciations are different. Anyone who says ""pundukh,"" even if they're not 
Armenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, 
""There was a car there, with five people inside it,"" he says. ""They started 
hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn't let the
people out,"" he says, ""they wouldn't let them get out of the car."" I only saw 
the car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from
Baku to Sumgait and back . . .

When they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there's a short guy,
his eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in
the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. ""We're
Azerbaijani,' they tell him, 'no Armenians here."" He did come up to me when 
we were pulling our things out and says, ""Maybe you're an Armenian, old man?"" 
But in Azerbaijani I say, ""You should be ashamed of yourself!"" And . . . he 
left. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had 
to . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own 
home.

They stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that's where the Kavkaz store 
and three large, 12-story buildings are. That's the beginning of down-town. I 
saw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I 
couldn't figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it 
was a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing 
remained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I
saw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About
30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.

I see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are
closed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the
crowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it's true, but pistol shots.
Several shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. 
Someone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the 
soldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one 
armored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning 
off Sumgait.

I walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by 
their gait that they're not bandits, they're just people, walking home. I
joined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us
and asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.
But I avoided the large groups because I'm a local and might be quickly 
recognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer
people. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.
I can't get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as 
to get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking 
behind him. And he's shouting into a megaphone: ""Comrades, the Armenian-
Azerbaijani war has begun!""

The police have megaphones like that. So they're talking and walking around 
the second microdistrict. I see that they're coming my way, and turn off 
behind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, 
and inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every
corner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were 
doing I can't say, because I couldn't get up close to them, I was afraid. But 
the most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least
find out if my children were alive or not . . .

""Assuming""? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in 
this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements I never 
addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is 
""right"" or who is ""wrong"", only that civilians ARE being used as cover 
and that, having been placed ""in between"" the Israelis and the guerillas,
they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.
 
	[The *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 
	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 
	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as
	""combatants"". So, what do you think is the ""meaning behind"", 
	the intention and the effect when an ""army"" purposely 
	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 
	like civilians'? *They are judging that the benefit they will 
	receive from this ""cover"" is more important that the harm
	that will come to civilians.*

This is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying
that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians
in ""the middle"" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart
from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower
the risk to civilians.

	But if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves
	at greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves ""why set 
	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made 
	cover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of 
	view, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept 
	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.

I agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel's bombing
sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND
ineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait 
until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that
""taking the fight *to* the enemy"" will do more to stop attacks. 

As I said previously, Israel spent several decades ""sitting passively""
on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*
the attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn't work very well.
The ""host"" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks 
from its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks
were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact 
on the civilians caught in their path.

This is just another ""selectively applied"" statement.
 
The reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis
is that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your
criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.

That is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for 
the ""interim"" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are
demanding conditions that essentially define ""autonomy"" already. They DO
NOT trust that Israel will ""follow through"" the entire process and allow
Palestinians to reach full autonomy. 

Do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? 
If you do, then why should Israel's view of Arabs/Palestinians 
be any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians' words?
Since they don't, they are VERY reluctant to give up ""tangible assets 
(land, control of areas) in exchange for ""words"". For this reason,
they are also concerned about the sorts of ""guarantees"" they will have 
that the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.

Absolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the
Israelis ""word"" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being
demanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party
finally gets HOLD of this ""land"", what the ""other party"" does
is totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,
your words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to
keeps its word does NOT get the land back.

While the ""major armaments"" (those allowing people to wage ""civil wars"")
have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still
remain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and ""commando""
raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
for human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.

Bat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks
were commonplace.

>Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.

There is NO WAY these groups can be effectively ""disarmed"" UNLESS the state
is as authoritarian is Syria's. The only other way is for Lebanon to take
it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially
mirroring Israel's border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that
it is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.

That's what I said, ok? But, doesn't that mean that Syria has to ""take over""
Lebanon? I don't think Israel or Lebanon would like that.
> 
What both ""sides"" need is to receive something ""tangible"". The Arabs/
Palestinians are looking for ""land"" and demanding that they receive it
prior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it
gives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic
situation (and that change doesn't help Israel's position), and 2) WHEN
it gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to
compensate for the increased risks

I sure hope so. Because, the unspeakable crimes of the Armenians must 
be righted. Armenian invaders burned and sacked the fatherland of 
Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population and presented to 
the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian civilization.

All reliable Western historians describe how Armenians ruthlessly
exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly people of 
Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of the 
Ottoman Empire between 1914-1920.

It is unfortunately a truth that Armenians are known as collaborators
of the Nazis during World War II and that, even today, criminal/Nazi
members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle preach and instigate
racism, hatred, violence and terrorism among peoples. 

And x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following 
ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle and criminal/Nazi Armenians, attempts to call into question the 
veracity of the Turkish Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian government and its terrorist
and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle 
of those whose closest ones were systematically exterminated by the Armenians,
the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and 
consequently a number of governments and organizations have become 
supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.

---------------------------------------------
The General Assembly

Taking into account the intifadah of the Palestinian people in the
occupied Palestinian territory against the Israeli occupation,
including Israeli economic and social policies and practices,

Rejecting Israeli restrictions on external economic and social

    April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world
are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members
by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.  
    At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,
and it is important to note that those who deny that this event
ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate
the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,
would like to see it happen again...

mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there.
The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.

In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed 
de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a 
genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The 
result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkish
governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In 
the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the 
successful genocide of the Armenians.

Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...
Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of 
Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as 
""rebels"".

Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.

Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims 
Armenians were a ""threat"".

In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of 
approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.

Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdish
population.

The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide.

	The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
refer to both Christians and Jews.  Christian fundementalists are
often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.  The
American media also uses fundamentalist to refer to Jews who live in
Judea, Samaria or Gaza, and to any Jew who follows the torah.

>	Actually, Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfile

Anyone care to speculate on this? I'll let the rest of the net judge
this on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished 
of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only 
the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian 
Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of 
Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines 
genocide as acting with a 

  'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a 
   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.' 

History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate 
the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the 
Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including 
U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy 
as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of 
the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the 
extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor 
those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. 

The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,
beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian 
territories.

The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government.

The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were
Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,
Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

It is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in
their signatures (I failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your
posting). Not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid
addressing ladies with ""Mr."", as you have done.

Secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as Cyprus has
never been Greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed
of Greeks and Turks. It seems that you know as little about the history and
the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of Turkey's 
military intervention to it under international agreements.

Be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what
is going on today on Azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist
policy that Armenia is now pursuing.

But, I could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political
conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as
""itchy-bitchy""...

Who is the you Arabs here.  Since you are replying to my article you
are assuming that I am an Arab.  Well, I'm not an Arab, but I think you
are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The
bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is
very consistent with its policy of intimidation.  That is the only
policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in
the middle east!

I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering.

I would defende my homeland against any invader by any means.

It's not relevant whether I agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
thought in what you say here an I appreciate your point. However, I would make 2
remarks: 

 - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
 - It's not only 'arab' governments.

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

 Transcaucasia).

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the

No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly 
people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated 
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 
1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide 
that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought 
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian 
terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that 
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
today.

A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri 
town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to 
have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military 
operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the 
Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been 
massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten 
and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed 
the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian 
insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the
Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City 
hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant 
were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to 
condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its 
sovereignty.

Thank you, Brad/Ali, for warning us about the dangers of propaganda.

Who is it that executes these ""pin-point attacks"" on Israelis?  The
guys in the white hats or the ones in the black hats?  Neither?  You
mean that they are just civilians, farmers, teachers, school children?
Well, maybe they ARE terrorists, after all?  And maybe that

Yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
Currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
and armored patrols.  No permanent installations have been
built in the area, nor are any planned.

As to the prodigal ""water question"",  you can continue to waste
your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the
testimony of people here, some Lebanese, who have acknowledged
that they know of no evidence for these allegations.

It depends which of those territories you refer to.
In general, settlers were moved into the territories because
at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the
logical move.  This is not to say that views don't change
or that mistakes are not made.  Currently, I would say that
the only ""disputed territory"" that does not appear to be temporary
is that of Eastern and northern Jerusalem.

DEPOSITION OF ROMAN ALEKSANDROVICH GAMBARIAN

   Born 1954
   Senior Engineer
   Sumgait Automotive Transport Production Association

   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 40
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


What happened in Sumgait was a great tragedy, an awful tragedy for us, the 
Armenian people, and for all of mankind. A genocide of Armenians took place
during peacetime.

And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in
those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.

On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there 
was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we 
didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they
wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd 
near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home 
watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir 
Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our 
house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields
there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the 
direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and 
started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off 
the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the
light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know 
and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.

Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:
there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother
Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War 
II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.

We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down 
with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, ""What's going on? What's 
happened?"" They say, ""Armenians, get out of here!"" We don't open the door, we 
say, ""If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow."" They say, ""No, 
leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!"" By now they've 
broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best
we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. 
We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,
and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and
when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no
police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We 
held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an 
axe, and then with a crowbar.

When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them 
with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, 
pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father 
in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the
room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother
Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he
was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured 
several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But 
they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there
were many of them.

The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go 
into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought 
skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father 
bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, 
and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw 
that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove
them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the 
bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in 
there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to 
chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of 
about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and
Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and 
started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through
the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no 
one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader 
of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a 
fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: ""What's with you, 
woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?""
She says, ""What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!"" My father 
was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian 
and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, 
""The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he 
brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person."" He says, ""You 
don't need to shout, stop shouting."" And when they heard the voice of this 
man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and 
started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, 
too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't 
know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even
though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started 
to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to 
call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all 
evening and all through the night.

Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were 
from Khachmas. They said, ""We heard that a group was here at your place, you 
have our condolences."" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay
in the room.

So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,
we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around 
one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, 
investigators. They say, ""Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back 
here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.""
Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take 
Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take 
Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,
but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the 
neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should 
hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and 
went up to the neighbor's.

The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,
ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a 
landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A
crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings
19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking 
into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians 
weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they 
poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were 
some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. ""They're up there, still,
up there. Let's go kill them!"" They broke up all the furniture remaining in 
the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding 
one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door 
shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling 
the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, 
and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, ""No, that's from some of the 
furniture."" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed 
him down.

The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and 
went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also
Armenians, they had left for another city.

The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, ""Are you 
crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the 
apartments? They could kill you and them!"" And to us :"" . . . Come on, leave 
this apartment!"" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At
first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and
he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound
of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went 
downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the 
other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. 
They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal 
they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our
Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.

With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were 
saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely 
accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the 
crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only
able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on 
the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We 
were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our
share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the 
troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been 
even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the 
genocide.

Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the 
leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their 
orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '
pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock 
in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was 
quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried 
Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were 
about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It 
was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people 
there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being
taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, 
there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It 
was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The 
child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible
to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a 
man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces 
were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...

Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what 
happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my 
father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.

I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was
established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what 
happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.

I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They
even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel 
mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They 
weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our 
troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right
across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The 
inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the 
soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They 
weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were 
at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket 
office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing 
Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that 
they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department 
came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though
perhaps they could have come and saved us.

As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus 
station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in 
fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in 
which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had
lists, the bandits. You can tell that the ""operation"" was  planned in advance.

Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the
leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian
people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops 
suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my 
family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait
Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would
have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.

At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR
Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest
possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could 
happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted
out for such deeds.

Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass 
disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,
very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There 
were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took 
part in the pogrom of our building all in all.

They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that 
retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

Sooner than you expect. Remember 'Cyprus'?

Too bad. In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established 
a vast network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two 
continents. Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and 
Waffen-SS in Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in 
espionage and fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and 
Arabian Peninsula. They were promised an 'independent' state under 
German 'protection' in an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National 
Council.' (A copy of this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional 
Record,' November 1, 1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, 
Nazi Armenians were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often 
expressed pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war. In summary,
during World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication
in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!
  I don't need your bias.""

Very simple.

""X-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
 against 2.5 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making

After all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim
people between 1914 and 1920.

You must be a new 'Arromdian'. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide. 

Now where shall I begin?

Receiving this message, I checked the reference, L.Kuper,""Genocide..."" and
what I have found was totally consistent with what Davidian said.The book
was like ""voice of Armenian revolutionists"" and although I read the whole book,
I could not find the original quota.
But there was one more thing to check:The original posting of Mutlu.I found 
the original article of Mutlu.It is as follows:

QUATO IS THE SAME, REFERENCE IS DIFFERENT !

DAVIDIAN LIED AGAIN, AND THIS TIME HE CHANGED THE ORIGINAL POSTING OF MUTLU
JUST TO ACCUSE HIM TO BE A LIAR.

Davidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...

You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow
you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise
all the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least
we may save time by not dealing with your lies.

And for the following line:
>Vay sarsak, vay yobaz, vay yalanci! Vay Turk milletinin yuz karasi Mutlu vay!

I also return all the insults you wrote about Mutlu to you.
I hope you will be drowned in your lies.

 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not

 As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
 given by Serdar Argic .. 
  
 You couldn't reject it...

 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc.

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
> 
>It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has
>377!
 
 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

Obviously, you really don't know.

They *have* spoken out (cf Sec'y of State Christopher's recent trip to the ME),
they have provided millions in aid, and they have participated in the airlifts
to Sarajevo.  They *would* supply military aid, if the UN would lift the embargo 
on arms sales.

Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet
Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion 
of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical 
documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, 
was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, 
program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and 
radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people 
of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the 
lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is 
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their 
lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations 
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and 
prosperously.

------------------------- letter ----------------------------------

During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which 
not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the 
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, 
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order 
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, 
which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide.

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;

5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;

6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new 
generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically
mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through
all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the 
armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in 
the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

Sigh.

Farwell LA, Donchin E. The truth will out: Interrogative polygraphy (""lie
detection"") with event-related brain potentials. Psychophysiology
1991;28:531-547

""The research reported here was supported in part by contract number 87F350800
with the Central Intelligence Agency. Preliminary reports were presented at the
1986, 1988, and 1989 meetings of the Society for Psychophysiological Research"".

Donchin happens to be an Israeli.

Do you really think that Israel needs something as primitive as torture when it
has THIS as well as something brought over by a Russian mathematician from the
Lenningrad Military Hospital in 1979  (factor-analysis of multiple unit
activity of the brain) ???  Surely you jest.

When Israel sics trained dogs on Arab prisoners the way it's commonly done on
prison farms in Mississippi or Alabama, *then* you have a right to protest
against torture. When Israeli security personnel beat Arab prisoners the way
Chicago police do, *then* you have a right to complain. Since it does NOT
practice physical torture in any way, kindly refrain from using this word.

Agressive actions are taken by both sides. Tough talk is done by both sides.
When an arab leader is menacing to throw all jews in the water is also tough talk,
I think. And killing people is mildly agressive (justified, in your opinion 
if they are israeli soldiers, justified, in others' opinion if they are jews, not
justified at all in others opinion).

When Brad wrote the article about 3 Israelis killed, ther was a lot of pride 
and satisfaction in his lines. That's what I feel disgusting. We may agree 
or not when a killing is 'technically' murder, but being enthousiastic about it?


And again, I may appreciate some of your points, but you are not objective. That
is not a blame, just a remark.

	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes

	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons

I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that are

*is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in 
Gaza.

Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying 
entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elements
that are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. 
Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses
(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are 
inherently in conflict.

Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its present
policies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third 
alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""
system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.
Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do with
regard to Islam's policies towards its minorities?

It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan
""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish
""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither?

Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israel

important that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""
be secured?

That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in 
the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  
Should we be happy when they die?  As I said before, the question is not
whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for the
Israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death.

I was trying to avoid a discussion of the whether Clintons views
should be endorsed or not.  All I was trying to find out was 
whether the newspaper article was correct in making these
statements about the President by obtaining some information
about when and where he made these statements.

...continued from PART A:

The six of them left. They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-
ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the 
physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had 
an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas
ornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this 
went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and 
was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into
tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .

Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I 
want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am 
silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling
me, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the
one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, 
telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring 
her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned empty
handed, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his 
apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. 
There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.

They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I 
went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the
apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be 
cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the 
doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, 
opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle 
Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He 
knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. 
Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their 
apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying
delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.
All of my family had gathered there.
   
At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the
apartment.

Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda, 
Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes 
you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as though
her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one 
side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her 
cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole
microdistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was 
afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started 
to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the
bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye 
that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk, 
my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something
tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my 
little golden one . . . "" She understood me.

Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. 
She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't 
understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was 
glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her 
forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how 
to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's
saying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil 
and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I 
can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me 
something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while,
then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says,
""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't
control myself.

Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped
a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She 
says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this 
damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need
to call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I 
understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich, 
that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him."" 
But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She 
says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She 
says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone.""

I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was 
crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can 
we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think, 
who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't 
answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and 
found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he 
was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, 
""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and 
tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was really
going on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's 
happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single 
Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised 
that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious 
. . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up 
and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK, 
fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back 
I'll send him over.""

We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly 
under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She 
wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed 
everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on
trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and 
finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your 
place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, 
because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep 
with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what 
shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has 
grown up daughters, they're almost my age.

The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and
went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, 
first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As
soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said
that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have
fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the
first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around
eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I 
saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies
. . . everything just like a war.

They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical
people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older 
Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud 
she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle 
Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he 
started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But 
when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his 
sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and 
started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""What
have they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and 
she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot."" 
Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what 
are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,
and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in 
there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my 
daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to 
drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the
doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa 
and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina 
out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I 
don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's 
the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter
in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.
I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told 
the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an 
Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my 
sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When 
she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would 
be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed
her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge 
wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said 
something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be 
dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.

They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. 
I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't 
know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" When
I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed 
very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says, 
""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They 
brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he 
just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said, 
""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were 
taking him.

Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were 
sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car 
up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't 
remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they
did to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa. 
Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I 
learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they 
didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying 
to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the 
balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw 
two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed 
against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him
with his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know 
what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before 
he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the
third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was 
Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they
were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with 
someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the 
yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that
I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.

They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too 
and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My 
father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault 
that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have 
probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not my
job."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, 
I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them 
to his apartment.

Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the 
doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I 
wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very
surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the
Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--
coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,
having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like 
they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.
""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she
would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same 
story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no 
drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon
found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And
they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at 
zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from 
seeing it.

They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have 
any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their 
place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira 
her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And
Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.
When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she 
involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.
Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful 
when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do what
you want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they 
wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I 
would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It 
was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do 
every day: steal, kill, rape . . .

Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts 
explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those 
children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the 
pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls that
would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow 
because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just
as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be 
of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the 
victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that
they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they
themselves said that.

And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many 
people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know 
why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, 
maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and 
they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at 
nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with 
Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over 
there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman 
shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . .

So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all 
happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several 
hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what
happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-
ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he
thought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What could
I do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words,
it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. 
That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of 
course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail
of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke
together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never
present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And
when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.

On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.
First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, 
the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. 
There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family 
there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They 
were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife 
and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.

Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.
There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.
They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.
The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide you
better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.""

We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We
had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to 
have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. 
They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you 
could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the 
police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is 
surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were 
standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought 
great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't 
just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,
or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost 
family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened 
when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single
person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must
have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret 
room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at
one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those 
people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that
the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the 
hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my 
parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should 
attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an 
Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and 
she wouldn't be able to take it.

Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people 
climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.
They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We 
calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some 
little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children
to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never 
have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people 
do eat.

Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They 
were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from 
the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a 
different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, 
and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came 
over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her 
sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were 
soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were
standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up
to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash 
him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not 
one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from 
doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, 
muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile
appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round
was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing 
terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the 
creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did 
this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She 
went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, 
""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they 
raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though 
nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no 
one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I 
could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so 
many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already
after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the 
elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. 
There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. 
The situation was deplorable.

At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, 
Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up
and put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, 
either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with 
dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little 
family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for 
the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone
spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded
machine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,
I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They hugged
them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly
moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.

They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in 
here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.""
This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other
places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the
SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I 
asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.
I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, the
Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest
assured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in
there is capable of anything.""

When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had
already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-
tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once
we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met 
acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who 
hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with 
them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had 
come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like 
they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, 
hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of 
course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed 
him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know 
what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.

And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very 
well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small 
room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night 
talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary 
of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see 
Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed 
from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask 
him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by 
soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with 
the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.

Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another 
two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, 
lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people 
who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I 
had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your 
Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are 
alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked 
them to continue what I was doing and went off.

The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's
father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels
Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the 
name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later 
it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had
somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for 
Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that 
in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored 
missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3

All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were 
contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple 
of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's 
going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels
they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev
[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to
him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it
was one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26
was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because
that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 
people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only 
a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try to
remember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there
were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy
don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people 
whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of
the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many 
people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns
in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the 
Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that 
there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical 
Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk 
cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went 
to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering
the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the 
Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's
more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list 
drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course
don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to 
publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, 
they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 
8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know 
her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in 
Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the 
same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her 
braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because 
they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one 
. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.

They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for
days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there 
and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; 
it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could 
already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the 
social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, 
""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gear
and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers 
and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, 
although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been 
dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it 
was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by
to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly
visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.

On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir
Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered 
only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.
Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.

Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I 
told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and
record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. 
We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the
conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor 
quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there 
weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a 
curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or 
video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that 
we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially 
to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw
that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to 
Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with 
Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two 
months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in
those two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.""

He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I
gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to
her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-
self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-
rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat
and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we
were in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like 
this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're
not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this
investigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact I
was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-
ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement
cells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in
every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of
Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary 
confinement.

Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma 
identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify 
anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the 
photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one 
who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the 
loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know 
his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that 
even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will 
continue looking for him.

The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various 
plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.
Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only
one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and
Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-
tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front
of me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash
simply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing in
a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the
investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even
though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological
pressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an
Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you
in short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.

The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire
pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was 
in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and 
all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned 
them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials
from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James 
Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were 
boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had 
been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't
even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did 
take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out 
slippers.

Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. 
Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for 
it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with 
one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that 
black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking
part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of 
Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently
arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I 
don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an 
Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know 
nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an 
axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and 
threw them into the tub with water.

I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You 
know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both 
their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-
eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I 
identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born
in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How 
did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I 
kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word 
as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one 
that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind
his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to
put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and 
told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said, 
""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an 
Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator 
asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one more
identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The 
name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became 
pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on the
table with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't 
turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start
acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they 
forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.
But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't 
me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his
hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew
into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out 
of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. 
Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked
and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and 
back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, 
but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or 
strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the 
microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his
last name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .
"" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. 
They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, 
because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're 
some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehand
they would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if 
nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or 
emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength 
. . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how were
you able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching
the tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped 
that high in gym class.""

So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of 
the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who 
beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.

At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his 
guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among
them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, 
""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three
o'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come 
we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went.

They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He
had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a 
motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him 
out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to get
the Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said, 
""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed 
him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was
in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that 
we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.

I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he
beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he
was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for
him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning
of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our 
apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I 
don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked
out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the
courtyard, he remained in the apartment.

At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her
I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't 
have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third
and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work
with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.

The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't
call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out
someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't 
understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know that
they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the
name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--
that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.
Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their
level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they
work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they 
crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were 
promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.
So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they 
promised us apartments.""

Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the
heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a 
children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at 
the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they 
have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or 
grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how
I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my 
own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time I
kept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife 
right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed.

But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a 
marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just 
have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his
grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how 
to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he 
knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed 
himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.

That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr 
Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilled
enough blood here.""

Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was 
that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya
and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They 
liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When 
Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors 
old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to 
the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were 
already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back
and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have 
sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older 
woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of 
Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.
The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands 
and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, 
he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.

There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first 
floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a
custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.
But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is 
tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.

Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we 
have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these 
events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come 
about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that 
without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not 
have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,
let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their 
nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are 
a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for
what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like
unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they 
threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,
to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on
February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone 
who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left
for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got
as far away as their legs would carry them.

February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came 
into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had 
been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for 
a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few 
teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or 
seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there 
were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the 
evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and 
the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the 
microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the 
driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani
child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had
seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They must
be killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The 
woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians 
cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That 
was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the 
direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.

We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a 
very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This 
he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him 
stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our 
territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my 
heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our 
territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. 
From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from
time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years 
the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant 
Armenians.

I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.
Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with 
the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,
that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our
teachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's 
spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we 
listened to the woman's speech.

Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the 
subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of
studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I
had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to 
obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,
""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If 
they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I 
tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he 
said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a 
second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already
after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, 
""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until 
twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in 
kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my 
children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go I
turned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the 
Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.

When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran
nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too 
much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed 
off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher 
wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.

To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at 
the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and
again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched 
television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last 
day. That's how it all was.

At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,
Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store 
on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she 
doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father 
held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the 
ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went 
out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the 
entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders 
there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the 
moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been 
injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, 
and their children: any way they could. 

Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, 
Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims 
what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one 
another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even 
with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and 
their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got 
them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked 
electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then 
they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an 
Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to 
escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of 
course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only
thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and
led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored 
personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that 
very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.

I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, 
strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a 
strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.

One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking 
for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, 
people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps 
dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and 
put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or 
infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the 
neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject 
came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the 
basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor
carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing 
as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor 
took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything 
seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing 
of ours he had managed to ""save.""

Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended 
themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were
Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some 
reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just 
victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. 
In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that 
the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not 
important, the truth will come out regardless.

So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our 
bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the 
years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've 
become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.

On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said
that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments
received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the 
Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-
tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on 
the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear
speaking our native tongue.

Yes, victims exist.  There are a staggering number of victims in the world and
more each day.  I think on balance, intervention would create more victims,
including American ones.  Since the first responsibility of the US government
is to protect Americans, I think they serve that role best by staying away
from Bosnia and other regional conflicts.

Of course not.  The Jews were not trying to carve a territory out of Germany
either, and except for small-scale resistance and a few larger uprisings, did
not have an army or a government.

I see the pattern of atrocities as a fairly often practiced tactic of a
colonizing power - driving away and/or eliminating the population of an
area they want to control.  The US tried basically that in Vietnam, the Iraqis
in Kuwait, the Israelis in Palestine, South Africa, etc, etc, etc.  It sucks,
it's ugly, and it's saddening.  But it is not genocide.

It is not my impression that the Serbs want to eliminate every Muslim in
Yugoslavia.  I still say the Bosnians are getting their asses kicked; they
should surrender and evacuate the areas they can't hold.

I am a staunch Republican, BTW.  The irony of arguing against military
intervention with arguments based on Vietnam has not escaped me.  I was opposed
to US intervention in Somalia for the same reasons, although clearly it was
not nearly as risky.

Well, one thing you have to remember is, the press likes a good story.   Good
for business, don't you know.  And BTW, not ""everyone"" wants to help the
side that is less like us.

I never said the two sides were morally equivalent, I said neither one is
innocent.

There are just too many good reasons to stay away:

1) The Europeans are perfectly able to deal with this dispute on their borders
   in any way we do it.  Put another way, we have no assistance to offer the
   Europeans which they do not already possess themselves.  It is not good to
   promote the idea in anyone's mind that the United States is responsible
   for cleaning up every bloody mess in the world.

2) Clinton is not the man to lead this country into a military adventure.  Full
   stop.

3) It is by no means clear what intervention would accomplish, nor that it
   would necessarily help the victims.  It is not clear what the goal is and
   at what point any commitment could be ended.

Aryans who do not base their reasoning on Nazi ideology are racists...

Thus spoke an American citizen in the name of Judaism. If this is Judaism,
I think Judaism should be combatted as any extremist and dangerous
philosophy.

I suspect however that Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other Jewish
scholars would have rather converted to Christianity than stay Jews, if
they would have perceived Judaism as such a perverted philosophy.

Those who wish to learn something about the perversion of Judaism,
should consult the masterly work by Yehoshua Harkabi, who was many
years the head of Israeli Intelligence and an opponent of the PLO. His
latest book was published in English and includes a very detailed analysis
of Judeo-Nazism.

C'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. In April 
1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus. A 
number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German
officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian
Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.
Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his
Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the
creation of an Armenian SS formation in order 

""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the 
 spirit of the Nazi ideas.""

He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories
of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish
homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels
Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language
radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were
produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]

    Jahre Deutsch-Armenische beziehungen,' (Heinz Holzberg
    Verlag-Oldenburg 1988), pp. 124 and 129.


The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored
by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the
establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
official position. His views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro
and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.
Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after
a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to
Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1] 

A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not
'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.
As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August 
1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of
Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.

Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.
The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in 
their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and 
independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and 
fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians

This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust: 

a) Dro (the butcher), the former Dictator of the Armenian Dictatorship and
the architect of the Genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds, the most 
respected of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional 
Republic in Berlin during World War II; 

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social 
theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members 
of the Aryan 'Super-Race;' 

c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves 
with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and, 

d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 20,000 members which fought side 
by side with the Wehrmacht.

   CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the
   massacres there including Deir Yassen,
   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are 
   greatly minimized.

As per request of Hasan:

From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:

[pp. 225-227]

    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to the
story of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicized
throughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had
four killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting
was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated
throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,
children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their
stone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy
was murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties.

    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in
accordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am
convinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].

    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.
Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wise
ruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal
superciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of
'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'

    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the
result it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.
Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the
Haganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.
Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main
road; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the
Haganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the
rest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even
before they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir
Yassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir
Yassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the
conquest of Haifa.""


[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the loss
of Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at
Ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by
Irgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish
officials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this
Arab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced
to reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of
evil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at
the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen
battalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lie
is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""

Well, Napoleon. It is your kind of people who are preventing peace 
on the world. First of all, you didn't answer the question I asked
at the end of my posting. And then you told me some bullshit

	Hate to be simple minded about this Tim, but I think its
really very simple.  He was a dirty Jew.  And the only good Jew, in
some peoples mind, is a dead Jew.  Thats what 40 years of propaganda
that fails to discriminate between Jew and Zionist will do.  Thats
what 20 years of statements like the ones I've appended will do to
someones mind.  They make people sick.  They drag down political

	Israel has a right to keep Jerusalem for many reasons.  They
include the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, the
fact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the
historical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.

	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,
the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
religious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,
who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  The
Jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned a
Jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
latrines.

	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
Jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
control the city.

	Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered in
Jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,
where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  Unlike Israeli
Jerusalem, Jews and Christians are not allowed in Saudi Mecca.

Subject: Himmler's speech on the extirpation of the Jewish race
Lines: 42
Nntp-Posting-Host: euclid.ucsd.edu


 WASHINGTON - A stark reminder of the Holocaust--a speech by Nazi 
SS leader Heinrich Himmler that refers to ""the extermination of the
Jewish race""--went on display Friday at the National Archives.
	The documents, including handwritten notes by Himmler, are
among the best evidence that exists to rebut claims that the
Holocaust is a myth, archivists say.
	""The notes give them their authenticity,"" said Robert Wolfe,
a supervisory archivist for captured German records.  ""He was
supposed to destroy them.  Like a lot of bosses, he didn't obey his
own rules.""
	The documents, moved out of Berlin to what Himmler hoped
would be a safe hiding place, were recovered by Allied forces after
World War II from a salt mine near Salzburg, Austria.
	Himmler spoke on Oct.4, 1943, in Posen, Poland, to more than
100 German secret police generals.  ""I also want to talk to you,
quite frankly, on a very grave matter.  Among ourselves it should be
mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.
I mean the clearing out of the Jew, the extermination of the Jewish
race.  This is a page of GLORY in our history which has never been
written and is never to be written.""  [Emphasis mine--rje]
	The German word Himmler uses that is translated as
""extermination"" is *Ausrottung*.
	Wolfe said a more precise translation would be ""extirpation""
or ""tearing up by the roots.""
	In his handwritten notes, Himmler used a euphemism,
""Judenevakuierung"" or ""evacuation of the Jews.""  But archives
officials said ""extermination"" is the word he actually
spoke--preserved on an audiotape in the archives.
	Himmler, who oversaw Adolf Hitler's ""final solution of the
Jewish question,"" committed suicide after he was arrested in 1945.
	The National Archives exhibit, on display through May 16, is
a preview of the opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum here on April 26.
	The National Archives exhibit includes a page each of
Himmler's handwritten notes, a typed transcript from the speech and

But what is Hasan B. Multu's middle name?  I'm not sure, but I heard
it was ""Bibo"".  I also seem to recall that ""Argic"" is Azari for ""bites

I don't like this comment about ""Typical"" thinking. You could state
your interpretation of Exodus without it. As I read Exodus I can see 
a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
in ideological/religious colors. The history in the desert can be seen
as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. That's why I think
it is a great book with which descendants Arabs, Turks and Mongols can 
unify as well.

This is nonsense. I lived in the Negev for many years and I can say
for sure that no Beduins were ""moved"" or harmed in any way. On the
contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them
now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. There are
quite a few Beduin students in the Ben-Gurion university. There are
good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.

All the Beduins I met would be rather surprised to read Mr. Davidson's

Subject: Ten questions to Israelis

Dear Shai,

Your answers to my questions are unsatisfactory.

In the answer to my first question, concerning the nonexistence of
Israeli nationality, your answer conflicts with information I have
received from other quarters, according to which there are two
distinct categories of classifying Israelis:  Citizenship
(Ezrahut) and Nationality (Le'um). The former is used on passports
etc, and the later for daily identification in Israeli society. I
am told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all
times and present them at many public places, almost every day.
These ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.
You maintain that this mainly because of religious services
provided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?
Could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it
serves no other purpose ?

In the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that
Israel has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were
'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I
read, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had
plans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into
Transjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of
Ben-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was
established, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for
later expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the
fact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the
land to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God
promised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the
borders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use
today ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what
it considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a
base for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one
cannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a
number of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).

Your answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public
official. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to
Vanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without
evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said
the truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why
should he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.

Somebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning
'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from
Ma'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do
exist in Israel. What do you think about that ?

You imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a
way to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been
used by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet
Union into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they
would not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are
clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be
very happy if you could convince me that what I am told about
Israel were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.
I suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest
discussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.

I hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.

	There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It
seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain
themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions
prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.

	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
Israel would not have to be there.  Until it is, Israel prefers that
its soldiers die rather than its children.

	Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is
signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell
the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is
kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.

	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer
zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to
those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the
Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

I was convinced that no one could have a more warped sense of the
world. They were 'our' grandparents who were cold-bloodedly exterminated
by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920, not yours. And you can always
participate in 'The Turkish Genocide Day' along with millions of Turkish 
and Kurdish people on April 23, 1993 in the United States and Canada. 

...On this occasion, we once again reiterate the unquestioned 
justice of the restitution of Turkish and Kurdish rights and...

- We demand that the x-Soviet Armenian Government admit its 
responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, render 
reparations to the Muslim people, and return the land to its 
rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has become an 
issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative that 
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

- We believe the time has come to demand from the the United States 
that it formally recognizes the Turkish and Kurdish Genocide, adopts 
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to Armenian pressures 
to the contrary.

- As taxpayers of the United States, we express our vehement 
protest to the present U.S. Government policy of continued 
coddling, protection and unqualified assistance towards x-Soviet
Armenia.

- We also demand that the United States return to the policies 
advocated by U.S. Ambassador Bristol and other enlightened statesmen,
who have undertaken a just, human and benevolent attitude towards 
the rights of the Muslim people and the just resolution of their Case.

- Our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x-Soviet Armenia's.

	There is something almost comical in the fact that Yigal Arens is 
important enough to have the ADL and G-d knows who else sifting through his 
garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).

	This brings to mind a few possibilities other than the ADL connection:

	- Bullock may have been working for Arens' friend in the PLO
	- Arens' father (or is it brother?) Moshe Arens (former Israeli Defense 
Minister) was spying on him.
	- Arens hired Bullock to spy on him to get attention.

	In any case, who cares?

wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that
is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk 
and act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing
to talk peace.

True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?

What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't
you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have
patience.

I am not aware of ""killings between Jewish tribes"" in the desert.

The point of ""typical thinking"" here is that while Arabs STILL TODAY
act in the manner you describe, like ""any nomadic people occupying a 
land"", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have
somehow progressed over time.  It is not surprising then that Arabs
often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar
with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic
cleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  It is precisely this 
mechanism at work that leads people to say that Jewish tribes were
killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a
ludicrous suggestion.

You are conveniently ommitting the fact that the Arab governments told the
Arab citizens of Israel to leave Israel, join with the Arab armies so that
after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these Arabs could
return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they
wanted that belonged to Jews.  When the Arabs lost, Israel was left with
a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back
into the country as citizens.  What would you have done?  Let them in so
they could kill Jews?  Israel sees those Arabs who stayed as citizens 
because they were loyal to Israel during the war and didn't leave.  Of
course some Arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing
between the two is impossible.  Therefore a decision was made based on
secuturity of the country.

No kibbutz that I have ever visited has any ""employees"" unless they had to
hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough 
people ON the kibbutz to do them.  In such cases, they are paid properly.
If a kibbutz turns away an Arab, 9I have never seen or heard of this) but it
reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole
kibbutz movement.

This just shows how ignorant you are of Israeli politics.  Although the 
major parties in Israel aren't religious (however not totally secular),
due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have
always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition.
In fact, from what I heard the present government is the least influenced
by the religious parties in the existance of Israel.  Israel CANNOT be
called a secular state.  For instace, Haifa is the only city in the country
(except for maybe some Arab cities) where buses run on the Jewish Sabbath.  
There are many other examples of religion in Israel.  Marriages in Israel
are NOT contolled by the state, but by Rabbis and Priests.  Obviously your 
disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country
you claim to know so much about.

Gaza and the idea of separation

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -
currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous
statement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly
MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government, regardless of what it does.

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step
towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's
government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a
marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not
disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic""
policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets
and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in
the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.

But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces
itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has
lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian
workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel
Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing
to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the
Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able
to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a
fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.

Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...The
liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical
separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to
understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab
workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement
designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that
their ideological support for separation only provides
'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status
quo>.

Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the
ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears
its burden. [.....].

""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,
humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether
this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off
responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to
thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very
easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at
the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue
all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs..."".

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an 
attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history. 
It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian 
dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst 
ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable 
of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian 
genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.

People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were 
killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there 
are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, 
despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been 
well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse
the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the
memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people
because of their religion or their race.

years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated 
and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy 
of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance

  in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,

  page 19:

 <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to
  reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil
  among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if
  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the
  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which
  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the
  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the
  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution
  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews
  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that
  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that
  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and
  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the
  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and
  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection
  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,
  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>


  page 21:

  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official
  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi
  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and
  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation
  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from
  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two
  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom
  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European
  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.
  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant
  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of
  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who
  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)


  page 41:

 <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were
 firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them
 and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians
 of Europe.

 Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is
 also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews
 as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.
 Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians
 representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European
 sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition
 it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their
 sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who
 regularly reported to the Ottomans.

 There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans
 in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances
 of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited
 instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the
 early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy
 for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman
 document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some
 Greek towns...>>

 page 43:

  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally
 accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,
 and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of
 the situation.>>


 page 46:

 <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not
 particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common
 interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition
 which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If
 there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between
 religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was
 that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with
 the Orthodox.>>

 page 46:

 <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context
 during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of
 interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed
 Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already
 existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish
 response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian
 countries to Ottoman domains.>>

 page 151:

  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the
  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would
  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,
  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and
  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions
  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the
  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>

  page 161:

  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success
  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success
  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both
  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough
  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success
  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve
  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear
  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable
  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.
  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their
  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the
  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>

  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear
  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly
  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and
  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob
  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They
  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will
  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German
  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,
  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest
  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you
  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with
  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out
  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain
  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are
  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.
  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us
  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow
  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and
  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy
  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him
  to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect
  your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here
  you will find rest...>>[13]

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a non-profit
organization.  I've donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible.  Why don't you contribute to a group
helping the homeless if you so concerned?

ADL authorities seem to view a lot of people as dangerous, including

the question as to why the ADL maintained files and spied on ADC members
in California (and elsewhere??)?  Friendly rivalry perhaps?

Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member? Or the NAACP? Or a reporter?

Tell me, 'kmagnacca', were you high on 'Arromdian of ASALA/SDPA/ARF'
when you wrote that? Humane behavior and tolerance of Turks was a
legend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of 
Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again, 
many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi 
Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish people
have unselfishly given home, protection, and freedom to the Jews over 
the centuries, including to thousands and thousands of them during 
the Second World War. Get a life or a cup of Turkish coffee.

 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the

 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious

                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST

An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently
completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the
Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in
Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,
1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree
program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for
the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the
G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.

Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and
European and Turkish Jews?

Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.
I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as
time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,
I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a
couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the
500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and
coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire
Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman
Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became
motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The
Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book
is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who
tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint
of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish
sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I
approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of
view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I
finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across
additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War
II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good
deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not
actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in
the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish
diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It
was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so
I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,
mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the
Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second
book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped
rescue Jews from the Nazis.

- How exactly did they do this?

The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents
the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period
before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in
1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi
Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and
the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of
reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were
being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new
talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three
months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey
arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and
were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish
universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical
personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors
came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political
scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in
Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the
Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,
came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics
in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the
Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually
came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other
German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.
One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical
producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to
Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the
Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul
Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first
phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by
Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in
Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded
themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in
the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I
even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey
praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting
the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been
persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the
Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The
second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in
1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and
especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They
had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of
the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the
Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was
threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews
throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might
happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled
to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their
Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the
Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of
anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not
worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot
to be a Turkish Jew.

- How so?

Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained
its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries
until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the
end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position
to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the
actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of
the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in
particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from
the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish
citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were
arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats
would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other
officials and say in effect:  ""These people are Turkish citizens.
You  can't do  this  to  them."" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be
released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish
diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.

The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.
They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion
of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and
manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they
usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.
The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps
to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded
trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and
succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews
were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in
Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish
consuls took place.

The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned
their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The
consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens
because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews
lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get
passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their
Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so
processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime
it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on
the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them
if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because
radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of
these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a
document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  ""irregular fellow
citizen."" The  document said in  effect ""This person is  a former
Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his
Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if
you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.""  The
diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on
it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they
accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this
means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who
had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.

Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of
Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to
retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these
interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all
Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to
prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz
before the Turkish consuls could do anything.

- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?

There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War
II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the
information in this section of  the book relates to the situation
in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls
sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in
reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would
present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are
Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the
Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish
consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from
Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran
regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas
so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were
often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern
Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these
governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of
the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish
Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to
Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either
escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of
southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much
better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy
fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.
Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also
worked to rescue Jews in that country.

- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats
acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin
from Nazi persecution.

Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their
interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their
treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German
territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.
On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not
discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis
claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not
discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.
Turkey  protested,   saying,  ""You  are  dividing   our  citizens
according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that
all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.
Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews."" American consuls
in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told
American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they
couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were
being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book
takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the
Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European
Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in
Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in
Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other
Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also
sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These
groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out
what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at
that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't
imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the
first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let
them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and
friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out
what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the
Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received
assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who
served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to
1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican
representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the
Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was
doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern
Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these
agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even
railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in
Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the
Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for
the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the
so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through
the Black Sea to Istanbul.

Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its
borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was
suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The
government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the
non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by
the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and
Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean
from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly
opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did
not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they
feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British
constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic
and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,
yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For
example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700
Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish
government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British
ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all
were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish
government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to
pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during
the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these
refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to
send money and food out of the country.

- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be
living in Israel.

Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the
first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not
go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the
non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en
route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.

- And you have rescued it from obscurity.

Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do
not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of
the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of
whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a
much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the
picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to
undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.

When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively
small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The
rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so
significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were
murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.

About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -
translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the
story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware
of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the
people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would
not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they
could see the documents.

- What languages are used in the documents?

Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There
is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of
the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I
did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what
Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A
few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did
not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in
fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying
to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For
example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency
was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in
helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President
Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had
been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York
City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The
documents related to his mission are in English.

I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust
historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His
father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had
gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't
personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more
can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone
someday will make the effort.

- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?

Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the
Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In
addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively
involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the
coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I
helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject
which was held in Istanbul in 1992.

- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken
place, what do you plan to do next?

I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War
for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the
years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the
victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its
independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid
II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an
important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed
all sorts of political movements.

Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in
British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning
a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate
at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School
of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the
University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the
University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to
UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the
John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute
in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National
Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He
has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and
Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor
for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish
studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and
Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in
Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional
service activities and public lectures  in both the United States
and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited
volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2
vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or
reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,
1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire
and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York
University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation
by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the
Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry
from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan
Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A
pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in
1992.

   O.K., its my turn:

	  DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!

   I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
   to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their
   plan !

   (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
   since it was coined by Bnai Brith)

   What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,
   is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
   Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in
   Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.

   However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their
   homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political
   thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
   Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.

   As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.

   Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
   super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
   Jews used to establish their state : Religion.


   Ahmed.

Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that
the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly
obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for
the destruction of the ""Zionist entity"". As far as I know the
Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies
the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can
post the relevant caluses.

Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been
posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am
sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than
happy to repost it.

Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and
even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very
heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.

It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support
people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing
one to many Jews.

Ahhh, of course. Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events 
like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those 
TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline
bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of 
Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any
bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be 
bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,
those wonderful ""mainstream moderates"" with whom Israel is attempting
to negotiate.

Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians
than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.
I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary 
_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather 
inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to ""the cause"" of
whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone
else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-
squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic
on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my 
favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back 
the execution of a ""collaborator?""  3 photos:
1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.
2) The ""collaborator"" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.
3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the ""collaborator
shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.

Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.
Remember Black September?
Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.

I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?

                     THE HAMAS WAY of DEATH
 
     (Following is a transcript of a recruitment and training
videotape made last summer by the Qassam Battalions, the military
arm of Hamas, an Islamic Palestinian group. Hamas figures
significantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel
deported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to
Hamas's kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer
version appears in the May issue of Harper's Magazine, which
obtained and translated the tape.)
 
     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a
refugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished
high school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work
for Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I'm married and I have
two daughters.
     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine
explicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is
Palestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and
women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]
Security Services.
     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,
cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most
important objective must be to put an end to the plague of
collaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and
interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose
the methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into
collaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,
we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.
     We don't execute every collaborator. After all, about 70
percent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into
their misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is
based on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many
collaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli
Border Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.
He's as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an
Israeli soldier.
     There's another group of collaborators who perform an even
more loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men
and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become
collaborators. I regard the ""isqat"" [the process by which a
Palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as
greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is
guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious
duty to execute him.
     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the
distribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the
Security Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their
victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and
impossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the
drugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.
     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of
uncovering collaborators, We can't afford to abduct an innocent
person, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished
forever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after
evidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If
after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any
doubt, then he is executed.
     In many cases, we don't have to make our evidence against
collaborators public, because everyone knows that they're guilty.
But when the public isn't aware that a certain individual is a
collaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for
evidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be
irrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually
obtained in the form of a confession.
     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start
off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell
him that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the
last moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the
information we need.
     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has
been a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them
confess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply
pressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts
confess as well.
     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an
interrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working
for the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself
confessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the
information to us. In addition, three members of his network of
collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this
much evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are
very careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our
principal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he
himself confesses his crimes. 
     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of
collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be
executed without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of
names, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not
mark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for
execution.
     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But
after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can't shoot him
-- to do so might give away our locations. That's why collaborators
are strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, ""What do you
think? How should we execute you?"" One collaborator told us,
""Strangle me."" He hated the sight of blood.

Pardon me Tim, but I do not see how it can be possible for the IDF to fail
to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
killed the three IDF troops and then later know the exact number and 
whereabouts of all of them. Several villages were shelled. How could the IDF
possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
villages? You see, it was an arbitrary act of ""retaliation"".

The problem, Tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was Palestinian

First, I believe that my statement applies to both sides.

Having said that, I think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
negotiable and what is not. For example, no country has the right to abuse
one's human rights. Deciding whether there will be one or two states in
Palestine is a legitimate question. While de facto one state exists, Israel 
must treat all within its domain equitably.

Yes, I am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
occupying your neighbor's land. Israel must resolve its disputes with the
native Palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.

Not true. Lebanese were not attacking Israel in the 1970s. With a strong
Lebanese government (free from Syrian and Israeli interference) I believe
that the border could be adequately patrolled. The Palestinian heavy
weapons have been siezed in past years and I do not see as significant a
threat as once existed.

Please, Tim, don't fall into the trap of treating Lebanese and Palestinians
as all part of the same group. There are too many who think all Arabs or all
Muslims are the same. Too many times I have seen people support the bombing
of Palestinian camps in ""retaliation"" for an IDF death at the hands of the
Lebanese Resistance or the shelling of Lebanese villages in ""retaliation"" for
a Palestinian attack.

   First this man promotes the dissolution of the Jews through an

of 'fundamentalist' Jews who will object.  This clown even called
for 'buying' the dissolution of the Jewish people.

   Does this idiot mean to suggest that any Jew who objects to an

MASSACRE UNCOVERED....

By ANATOL LIEVEN,

More than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have 
been spotted on hillsides in Nagorno-Karabakh, confirming claims 
that Armenian troops massacred Azeri refugees. Hundreds are missing.

Scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley 
and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last Wednesday's 
massacre by Armenian forces of Azerbaijani refugees.

From that hill can be seen both the Armenian-controlled town of 
Askeran and the outskirts of the Azerbaijani military headquarters 
of Agdam. Those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their 
own lines.

We landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last 
troops of the Commonwealth of Independent states began pulling out. 
They left unhindered by the warring factions as General Boris Gromov, 
who oversaw the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, flew to Stepanakert 
to ease their departure.

A local truce was enforced to allow the Azerbaijaines to collect their 
dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. All the 
same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby Armenian 
positions.

In all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. At least another 
31 have been taken into Agdam over the past five days. These figures 
do not include civilians reported killed when the Armenians stormed 
the Azerbaijani town of Khodjaly on Tuesday night. The figures also 
do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies

Zahid Jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 
people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came 
by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and 
of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. Around the bodies 
we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. 
The bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. 
All are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly 
clothing of workers.

Of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national 
volunteers were wearing uniform. All the rest were civilians, 
including eight women and three small children. TWO GROUPS, 
APPARENTLY FAMILIES, HAD FALLEN TOGETHER, THE CHILDREN CRADLED 
IN THE WOMEN'S ARMS.

SEVERAL OF THEM, INCLUDING ONE SMALL GIRL, HAD TERRIBLE HEAD 
INJURIES: ONLY HER FACE WAS LEFT. SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD HOW THEY 
SAW ARMENIANS SHOOTING THEM POINT BLANK AS THEY LAY ON THE GROUND.

	It was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an
exclusive state.  If the state was to be exclusive, it would not have
400 000 arab citizens.

	And no, I do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
action.  When someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing
to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  It
is not a hostile action leading to war.

	Oh, you mean like both Jews and Arabs being citizens?  The

	Israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...It
still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  And how
is granting citizenship a facade?

	Try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to

	Also, Jews did have history in Israel for over a thousand
years.  There were lots of Jews slaughtered by Crusaders in Israel.
There was a thriving community in Gaza city from roughly 1200-1500.
Jews were a majority in Jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  Does that
make the land Jewish?

Done. But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion
and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself.
During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and
cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication
in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]

""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing."" 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists. Mr. Amarian!

Subject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations


AVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR
---------------------------------

""Hebrew labor"" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement
for a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew
must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The
land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same
new Jew who has ""learned"" to work it. Both aspects of the
two-pronged concept of ""Hebrew labor"" have racist connotations. On
the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical
labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other
hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the
Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.

The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from
the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and
hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of ""Hebrew labor"" to the
history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It
has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to
problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this
concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the
closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of
Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, ""I have no tears for those who
get rich off of cheap labor"". 2) to furnish an answer to the
unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for
wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.

The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from
the far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in
their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two
ethnical communities and ruling over them.

The desertification of the arid Negev

Military Base XIV.  The Negev in the Year 2000

Just after the creation of the State of Israel, the phrase ""the
Jewish pioneers will make the desert bloom"" was trumpeted
throughout the Western world. After the Six Day War in 1967, David
Ben-Gurion declared in a letter to Charles de Gaulle: ""It's by our
pioneering creation that we have transformed a poor and arid land
into a fertile land, created built-up areas, towns and villages in
abandoned desert areas"".

Contrary to Ben-Gurion's assertion, it must be affirmed that
during the 26 years of the British mandate over Palestine and for
centuries previous, a productive human presence was to be found in
all parts of the Negev desert - in the very arid hills and valleys
of the southern Negev as well as in the more fertile north. These
were the Bedouin Arabs.

The real desertification of the Negev, mainly in the southern
part, occurred after Israel's dispossession of the Bedouin's
cultivated lands and pastures. Nowadays, the majority of the
12,800 square-kilometer Negev, which represents 62 percent of the
State of Israel (pre-1967 borders), has been desertified beyond
recognition. The main new occupiers of the formerly Bedouin Negev
are the Israeli army; the Nature Reserves Authority, whose chief
role is to prevent Bedouin from roaming their former pasture
lands; and vast industrial zones, including nuclear reactors and
dumping grounds for chemical, nuclear and other wastes. Israeli
Jews in the Negev today cultivate less than half the surface area
cultivated by the Bedouin before 1948, and there is no Jewish
pastoral activity.

I. Agricultural and pastoral activities of the Negev Bedouin
before and after 1948
-------------------------------------------------- In 1942,
according to British mandatory statistics, the Beersheba
sub-district (which corresponds more or less to Israel's Negev, or
Southern, district) had 52,000 inhabitants, almost all Bedouin
Arabs, who held 11,500 camels, 6,000 cows and oxen, 42,000 sheep
and 22,000 goats.

The majority of the Bedouin lived a more or less sedentary life in
the north, where precipitation ranged between 200 and 350 mm per
year. In 1944 they cultivated about 200,000 hectares of the
Beersheba district - i.e. 16 percent of its total area and *more
than double the area cultivated by the Negev's Jewish settlers
after 40 years of ""making the desert bloom""*

The Bedouin had a very low crop yield - 350 to 400 kilograms of
barley per hectare during rainy years - and their farming
techniques were primitive, but production was based solely on
animal and human labor. It must also be underscored that animal
production, although low, was based entirely on pasturing.
Production increased considerably during the rainy years and
diminished significantly during drought years. All Bedouin pasture
animals - goats, camels and sheep - had the ability to gain weight
quickly over the relatively rainy winters and to withstand many
waterless days during the hot summers. These animals were the
result of a centuries-old process of natural selection in harsh
local conditions.

After the creation of the State of Israel, 80 percent of the Negev
Bedouin were expelled to the Sinai or to Southern Jordan. The
10,000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
40,000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150
mm - a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
of three. The rare water wells in the south and central Negev,
spring of life in the desert, were cemented to prevent Bedouin
shepherds from roaming.

A few Bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central Negev.
But after 1982, when the Sinai was returned to Egypt, these
Bedouin were also eliminated. At the same time, strong pressure
was applied on the Bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
in order that the land could be transferred to the army.

No reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
today by Negev Bedouin. It is a known fact that a large part of
the 40,000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized
by the Israeli authorities. Indeed, most of the Bedouin are now
confined to seven ""development towns"", or *sowetos*, established
for them.

	Wrong.  Zionism *acknowledges* the fact that anti-Semites
exist, and prevent Jews from living in peace.  That does not mean we
agree that Jews are all greedy, that Jews kill Christian Children,
commited deicide, or anything else.  We acknowledge that there are
morons out there who do believe these things.

Dorin,
Let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. The
distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people
whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these
soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And
resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich
were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).
Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by
resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the
Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the
Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the
only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving
out the US)

Was the article about zionism? or about something else. The majority
of people I heard emitting this ignorant statement, do not really
know what zionism is. They have just associated it with what they think
they know about the political situation in the middle east.

	A neutral organization would report on the situation in
Israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
Hamas ""activists.""  A neutral organization might also report that
Israeli arabs have full civil rights.

	Terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians.  Terorism includes
such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
boat because he happens to be Jewish.  Not allowing people to go where
they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed
last week, is not terorism.

Come on!  Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war

All of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
Israel activity or propoganda.  The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if
anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.

No, that is why World Trade Center bombings don't happen in Israel (aside from
the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (
Palestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and 
""kill many Jews."") are caught.  As Mordechai Levy of the JDL said, Paranoid

While that is currently true from their perspective, it is also
worthwhile to note that in such cases the populace often does suffer
from attempts to control the guerillas.  Furthermore, there were
cases in the past of Palestinian gun emplacements being situated
within villages.  The argument that can be made for small arms
fire can not be made for field pieces.

As I recall, Amal was primarily nationalistically ""Lebanon for
the Lebanese"" motivated.  I think that the difference between them
was also a matter of funding and support.  One question does
come to mind however, 

Given that you claim the Hizbollah to be more committed etc... and
that their stated position is:
	1.  No peace talks.
	2.  No peace talks.
	.
	.
	.
	.
	N-1. No peace talks.
	N.  No Israel

if we assume that Lebanon and Syria are sincere in their desire for
peace, why hasn't the Hizbollah been disarmed?

I agree that Syria wants Lebanon to be part of its greater Syria.
I don't necessarily see that the Syrians would be unhappy to see
Israel up to its neck in another Lebanese morass afterwhich Syria
could continue on its merry schedule when Israeli public opinion
would lead to a second pullout.

Why can't some gov'ts negotiate as easily as some people?

I looked very closely at a large number of sources.  You have no
idea what you are talking about.

That's true about the accounts of both Irgun and Arab propagandists.
Like Begin, for example.

No, I never got that feeling.  I got rather opposite feelings
about people like you, though.

Honesty?  Perhaps you would explain the testimony from members
of the Irgun, to be found in their own handwriting in the
Irgun Archives in Tel Aviv, that the wounded Arabs were killed,
that a group of 80 prisoners was massacred, that Lehi proposed
exterminating everybody at the pre-raid meeting.  Exactly what
reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected
in favour of Begin's?

>Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin ""massacre"" stuff

>unless you find something serious to contradict it.

This is very funny.  You carried on about unsupported evidence,
propagandists, axes to grind, and you end up telling us to stick
to the account of the leader of the alleged killers.  You are
obviously a hopeless case, as everyone can plainly see.

It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It
seems to be that what we lack is the will.
Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,
today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which
is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

Source: Edward K. Boghosian, ""Radical Group Hosts Well-Attended Solidarity
Meeting,"" The Armenian Reporter, May 1, 1986, pp. 1 & 18.

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,
including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both
Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the 
Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during
the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian
Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.

The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of
the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia
(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern
countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of ASALA...

Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian
people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of
the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...
Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement 
was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam 
Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued 
support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, 
pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be 
open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr. 
Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that 
his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that
this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to 
Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.

Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;
two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of
the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist
party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,
a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the
European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.

More than significant was the large number of messages received by the 
organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary
Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation
Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist
Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other
international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict.

                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM

Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary
Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the
Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will
continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,""
to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau.""
The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that
exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,
open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.

The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.
The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Now any comment?

(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..

 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is

 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Proven?  Maybe not.  But it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  This
statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  Before the Six Day War (1967)
I think Nasser and some other Arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on
Arab radio.  You might want to check out some old newspapers Ahmed.

I think if you take a look at the Hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a 
different impression.  I have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation
that I've verified with Arabic speakers.  The document is rife with calls to kill jews
and spread Islam and so forth.

This was true (and I may add the adjective ""stupid"") until the Intifada.
Since then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinks
the the occupied territories worth the trouble. The only question became
the question of price and other quantitative detail. The best thing the 
Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifada
and try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).
Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justified
as it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that 
prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes. Currently 
it serves no purpose and it's just a waste of human life and economic
resources.

Don't swallow propaganda as truth Sir. British promised to Venizelos
(greek PM) that mainly greek populated areas of the Ottomans will be
given to Greece, _if_ he will agree to drag Greece in the side of
the British during the WWI (because the greek King was proGerman).
The British succeeded by bombarding Athens (1916), killing quite a few,
forcing abdication of the King, division of Greece into two separate
states (North-South), and finally laying the ground for the most disasterous
division between greeks for our century.(So don't feel bitter that the
""Allies"" gave any green light because they liked us....)

Anyway, the British succeed to establish Venizelos, war starts at a second
front against the Germans in the south while they were fighting the war
in the East against the Russians, and finally the WWII came in an end.
After that the British (and French) forgot immediately their promises
(as usually). Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek
cause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual
""reasoning"" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually
backup Kemal (who had given now to the British ""water and bread"" that
he will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small
ethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan
to keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion
into warm-water facilities. The ""greek empire"" being an Orthodox Christian
state was too prone to become Russian client.

Out of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our
lands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true ""Giants"" by the
British, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.
Under the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big
military funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian
buffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because
otherwise the use of terror of changing ""the balance of power in the Aegean""
will be used.

Under the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.

Gr

PS: I don't make any anti-...whatever rhetoric. This is the situation
    in our region and needs to be said. The previously mentioned powers
    are not anything special; they are fucntioning the same way which
    anyone else functions all throughout history. So I don't selectively
    single them out; just they are relevant to _our_ current afairs.

News reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  
CAPS don't change facts.

BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,
BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
BM] is a part of it.  

henrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged 
henrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.

So?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about 
DEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.

henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the 
henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. 

BM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM]  within their borders?  

henrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into

So I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?

henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER 
henrik] OCCUR again.

BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?

henrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
henrik] into Armenia if SHE could.

Why would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash
that Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,
like economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd
be happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET
rather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't 
do.  

BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header

henrik]	   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many

Even if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would
be to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been
a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the
time, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no
wish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not
only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]

BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes 
BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians 
BM] are attacking Azeri towns.

henrik]	   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey
henrik]	   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!

So what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  

henrik]	   I will believe it when I see it.

No, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.

henrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
henrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?
	
This kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.

henrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the
henrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean
henrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !

Now, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff
perpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to
keep the hatred alive, right?

BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
BM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  

henrik]	   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are 
henrik]	   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 
henrik]	   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. 

Well they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods
of asking (not very peaceful I'd say).

BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent 
BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better 
BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

henrik]	   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
henrik]	   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in
henrik]	   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.

I don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.
Peace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening
right now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights 
raving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure
there'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other
side.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace
than they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't
strong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the 
bombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign 
relations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided
atrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to 
the other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,
this being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.


BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of 
BM] their blood and future. 

henrik]	   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension
henrik]	   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH
henrik]	   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.

Azeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support
what they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be
reached in this manner.  

BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize

BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate

Why is your criticism ALWAYS directed against Israel, but never

This is why the ""land-for-peace"" formula is so foolish.  Land-for-land
or peace-for-peace seems much more just, except that it would cost the
Arabs something and so is not under consideration.  

Let's not forget that about half of Israel's population are refugees
from Arab countries.  Somehow, THEIR land now being occupied by Arab
states and THEIR homes now being lived-in by Arab people are not
included in any negotiations.  Is this your prescription for peace?

Again, you've somehow managed to overlook the fact that the Arab
states are much more restrictive on these points.  In fact, the
officially Judenrein policies of almost all of the Arab states makes
them resemble Nazi Germany chillingly closely.

There are many states in which Christians can live happily, many which
have official religions and Christian majorities and Christian-based
laws.  There are some 2 dozen Arab and Islamic states.  There is only
1 (one) Jewish state.  Do you have a problem with this?  Is this one
Jewish state too many?  There are others who might agree with you, you
know.

Have you just arrived on tpm recently???  Again, the supporters of the
Arab and Islamic camps are frequently and massively guilty of
""emotional, infantile outbursts"" which have weakened their positions
dramatically.  Somehow, your criticisms are very one-sided and
simple-minded. 

P.S. How's the Fund coming along?

Only Brendan McKay, or maybe ARF, would come to the rescue of Nazi
racial theory.  Is it distressing Brendan?  The point is that any
eugenic solution to the Jewish Problem as Elias has proposed smacks
of pure Nazism.  The fact that Elias' proposal cast the entire ""problem""
as one of the abnormal presence of Israeli society in the Middle East,
and that he buried a slam against U.S. aid to Israel in the midst of
his ""even-handed"" solution of the Jewish Question, made it obvious what 
he had in mind: disolving the Jewish polity.  That *is* a Nazi doctrine:
rectification of the ""abnormal presence"" of the Jewish people within a 
larger body politic.  Whether your ""solution"" involves gas, monetary 
incentives to the poor Jews to marry out, or as Feisal Husseini has 
said, ""disolve the Zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal 
surrounding Arab culture,"" you are engaged in a Nazi project.

Just as obvious is your statement: ""I will not comment on the value

(just an interrupting comment here) Since EARLY 1980's , israelis said they are

Palestineans. Palestineans refused and will refuse such settlement that denies

Ok. I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,
i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who
have the right for it.

As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the
current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they
are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions
that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same
for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of ""negotiations"" in Madrid,
and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why
are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.
I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to
loose ?

Arabs feel that the current ""negotiations"" is ONLY for legitimizing the current
status-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and
""oranges"". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked. 

Just an opinion.

Just to address this one point, what about the two Katyusha rocket 
attacks made within Lebanon, for which Fatah claimed responsibility.
I didn't realize that one can use Katyushas while onr is disarmed.
Also, Page 8 of today's New York Times, Faisal Saleh, a high ranking 
Fatah official, and his 9 month old son were gunned down in Beirut 
by members of Abu Nidal.  There have been 46 assasination attempts 
in 1993 alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in
11 deaths.

I flipped on my local Cable Access Channel (a channel where any
community member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50
per half hour) and saw a ""documentary"" (I use this term loosely)
on the conflict in the West Bank.

It was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was
terrible, and the camera was really jumpy).  The documentary (sic)
told the tales of all of the children who died in the ""war"" against
the Jews as martyrs.  

It was a regular sob story.  One ""victimized youth"" was recounting
on how all he ""really"" wants to do is to get an education and that
the big bad Jews won't let him go to high school.  He admittedly 
spent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a Jewish woman
but claims that it was ""for the cause.""

I have seen this kind of garbage before.  I have a lot of sympathy for
the Palestinian cause (as do many Jews), but I think that even many
Arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary!

The most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end
was an address for the makers of the film named JEWISH COMM. ON
THE MIDDLE EAST.

Anybody heard of them?  They make Peace Now look like right-wingers.

Oh, why do you expose your ignorance?  The US has been running on debt for

And after the Gulf War, Israel could do whatever it wanted after
not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged, but
by no means forced, to negotiate.

Mr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a 
nutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile,
and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it 
were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by
Israel.  But that is not what Israel wants.

You apparently think you are some sort of one-man judge and jury who
can declare ""total"" victory and then sit back and enjoy the
applause.  But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few
rigged ""quotations"" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir
Yassin ""massacre.""

You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.
At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big
difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding
""quotations"" that support your preset opinions.

If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that
many of the sources of your ""quotations"" have an axe to grind, and
therefore you must be very careful about whom you ""quote.""  For
example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,
and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of
his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience
shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his
anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be
considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of
course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy
""quotation"" that you can use to attack Israel.

Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a ""scholar""
when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.
It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an
attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at
the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,
you will see his ""indictment"" to be pure hot air.  And this is the
BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning
evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as
""scholarly,"" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see
that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.

The Deir Yassin ""massacre"" never took place as the propagandists
tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila ""massacres."" Do you get
the feeling people like to blame the Jews for ""massacres,"" even if
they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews
like to do it, for reasons of their own.

Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin ""massacre"" stuff
with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version
unless you find something serious to contradict it.

  This is the latest from UPI 

     Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told journalists Turkey was
     closing its air space to all flights to and from Armenia and would
     prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
     Turkish territory.

While I applaud investing of money in Yehuda, Shomron, v'Chevel-Azza,
in order to create jobs for their residents, I find it deplorable that
this has never been an active policy of any Israeli administration
since 1967, *with regard to their Jewish residents*. Past governments
found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the
requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating
industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? 

After 26 years, Yehuda and Shomron remain barren, bereft of even 
middle-sized industries, and the Jewish settlements are sterile
""bedroom communities"", havens for (in the main) Israelis (both
secular *and* religious) who work in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem but
cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs.

There's an old saying: ""bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh"" -- just living there
wasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. But instead, we ""settled""
for Potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing
for others what we should have done for ourselves).

I do (did) contribute to the ARF mortgage fund but when interest
rates plumetted, I just paid it off.

The problem is, I couldn't convince Congress to move my home to 
a nicer location on Federal land.

BTW, even though the building is alleged to be funded by tax exempt
private funds, the maintainence and operating costs will be borne by 
taxpayers forever.

Would anyone like to guess how much that will come to and tell us why

If ""ownership"" were rightly based on ""worthiness"" there wouldn't be any owners.
What is your point?

As I understand it, Israel's ""claim"" on Jerusalem is based on 1) possession,
and 2) the absolutely CENTRAL (not second, not third) role it plays in jewish

It seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested
who is behind the Center for Polict Research. I will oblige.

My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My
mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
(at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go
to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in
Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from
my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to
the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem
with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare
not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My
work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices
in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based
on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.

The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities
undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command
the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal
institution and works with minimal funds.

Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published 
several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.

I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in
a more civilized manner. Calling names is not helpful.

In the South Lebanon area, only Israeli (and SLA) and Lebanese troops

Syrian troops are deployed north of the Awali river.  Between the

That is your opinion and the opinion of the Israeli government.
I agree peace guarantees would be better for all, but I am addressing
the problem as it stands now.  Hopefully a comprehensive peace settlement
will be concluded soon, and will include security guarantees for
both sides.  My proposal was aimed at decreasing the casualties
in the interim period.  In my opinion, if Israel withdraws
unilaterally it would still be better off than staying.
The Israeli gov't obviously agrees with you and is not willing
to do such a move.  I hope to be be able to change your opinion
and theirs, that's why I post to tpm.

As I explained, I contend that if Israel does withdraw unilaterally
I believe no attacks would ensue against northern Israel.  I also
explained why I believe that to be the case.  My suggestion
is aimed at reducing the level of tension and casualties on all sides.
It is unfortunate that Israel does not agree with my opinion.

Because Israel is not occupying the ""Security Zone"" free of charge.
It is paying the price for that.  Once Israel withdraws it may have
lost a bargaining chip at the negociating table but it would save
some soldiers' lives, that is my contention.

  If Lebanon were willing to agree to

That is completely untrue.  Hizbollah is now a minor force in Lebanese
politics.  The real heavy weights are Syria's allies.  The gov't is 
supported by Syria.  The Lebanese Army is over 30,000 troops and
unified like never before.  Hizbollah can have no moral justification
in attacking Israel proper, especially after Israeli withdrawal.
That would draw the ire of the Lebanese the Syrian and the
Israeli gov'ts.  If Israel does withdraw and such an act 
(Hizbolllah attacking Israel) would be akin to political and moral 
suicide.

they've been living there for thousands of years, except for periods when

The ADC is an organization of Arab-*AMERICANS*.

Let me see...you're saying that ""most if not all"" Arab-AMERICANS should be
spied on?  You're also saying that ""most if not all"" Arab-AMERICANS
should be views as a national security threat to Israel (and the US, 
as you gratuitously imply in your reference to the WTC bombing, in 
which no Arab-AMERICANS were involved)?  By inference, can we assume 
that you think that anyone of Arab lineage anywhere in the world poses 
a threat to Israel and, therefore, should be spied on?

Perhaps, then, on the basis of Pollard spy case (not to mention the
Rosenbergs, etc.) you think that all Jewish Americans should be spied 
on by the ADC.

Oh, never mind; this whole spying case has obviously so 
convoluted your sense of right or wrong in these matters that I have

So the LA times reporter who had information about him

activity or propaganda""? Are we to infer that the simple act of
reporting an event in a newspaper constitutes ""anti-Israel

  And why are we in Somalia?   When right across the Gulf of Aden are
  some of the wealthiest Arab nations on the planet?  Why does the 
  US always become the point man for this stuff?   I don't mind us
  helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects
  us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these
  events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the
  resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  I mean, it's 
  not like either Serbia, or Somalia represent some overwhelming
  military force that their neighbors can't handle.  Nor are the 
  logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge 
  to get troops and supplies from New York to Somalia, than from 
  Saudi Arabia; harder to go from Texas to Serbia, than Turkey or 
  Austria to Serbia.

'So-called' ? What do you mean ? How would you see the peace process?

So you say palestineans do not negociate because of 'well-founded' predictions ?
How do you know that they are 'well founded' if you do not test them at the 
table ? 18 months did not prove anything, but it's always the other side at 
fault, right ?

Why ? I do not know why, but if, let's say, the Palestineans (some of them) want
ALL ISRAEL, and these are known not to be accepted terms by israelis.

Or, maybe they (palestinenans) are not yet ready for statehood ?

Or, maybe there is too much politics within the palestinean leadership, too many
fractions aso ?

I am not saying that one of these reasons is indeed the real one, but any of
these could make arabs stall the negotiations.

DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]


          Born 1972
          Attended 9th Grade
          Middle School No. 17

          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25
          Microdistrict No. 3
          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came 
home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period 
in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was 
the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and 
other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first 
cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and 
on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring 
that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.

When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped 
by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. 
The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus
begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to 
the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking 
passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not 
taken for Armenians.

We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old 
building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was 
packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th 
Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking
passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.
Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning
cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death to
the Armenians"" was written on the cars.

When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still
quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call 
Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. 
Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to 
come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us
to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you 
enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was 
beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, 
that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people 
were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very 
long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, 
looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said 
things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a
car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that 
they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that 
there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of 
the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later 
found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri
Avakian was killed, too.

When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go 
home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We 
started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We
tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We
decided she had already left.

We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my
father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's
work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our
town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get
out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,
but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the
call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke
down the door and came into the apartment . . .

They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians 
were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we 
could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He 
read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alone
was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the 
courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, 
pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They 
had knives and steel truncheons.

I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if
I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents 
and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded
that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken 
outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to
push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind 
her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began 
beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.

We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their 
balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they 
strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I 
lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the
first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are
lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from 
their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is 
broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an 
ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.

We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and 
try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, 
they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our 
neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she
sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the 
window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a 
result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken 
away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken 
away, and everything will be OK.

But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the
ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received
attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 
o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with 
some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, 
and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds
on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are 
in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.

In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them
Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only
Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,
before the 27th.

Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was 
released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first 
they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out 
that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.

My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My 
mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the 
leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.

They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their
heads were smashed open and bled profusely.

At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out 
later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called 
specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address 
and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.
Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the 
phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He 
denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father 
answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he 
called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of 
automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had 
never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 
years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he 
was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.

My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was 
two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to
go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He
went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural 
projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and 
later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from 
the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in 
a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.


My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I
always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it
was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and
wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military
School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-
sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join 
the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life
long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it
more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,
and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.

Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home 
of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.

While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had
suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at
their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long
time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I
also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped

. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,
about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with
his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and
his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even
came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But
in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of
others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .

Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,
was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to 
recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.
I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision
of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of 
Armenia.

After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give
Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live
peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they
can do that.

I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.
After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I 
think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.

You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno
Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had 
even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move 
here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and 
that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was
wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct 
a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies 
in the hands of our government.

Sorry, I misread your remark about young men and women.  (Though I am now

You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to
help the ""butchers of their choice"".  Since the primary targets of help are
Muslim victims of ""ethnic cleansing"", you imply that such Muslim victims are
butchers.

>1) People become butchers by butchering.  There have been atrocities on all

This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that
victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?

>These people have been butchering each other for centuries.  When one

Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ""ethnic cleansed"".  The Serbians want to ""ethnic cleanse"" the Muslims.  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent.

I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.

For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?

4/15/93 1242  Turkey sends light weapons as aid to Azerbaijan

By SEVA ULMAN
   
ANKARA, Turkey (UPI) -- Turkey is arming Azerbaijan with light weapons to help
it fight Armenian forces in the struggle for the Nagorno- Karabakh enclave, 
the newspaper Hurriyet said Thursday.

Deputy Prime Minister Erdal Inonu told reporters in Ankara that Turkey was
responding positively to a request from Azerbaijan for assistance.

""We are giving a positive response to all requests"" from Azerbaijan, ""within
the limits of our capabilities,"" he said.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Vural Valkan declined to elaborate on the nature
of the aid being sent to Azerbaijan, but said they were within the framework 
of the Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Hurriyet, published in Istanbul, said Turkey was sending light weapons to
Azerbaijan, including rockets, rocket launchers and ammunition.

Ankara began sending the hardware after a visit to Turkey last week by a
high-ranking Azerbaijani official. Turkey has however ruled out, for the second
time in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.

Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to suffer
defeat at the hands of the Armenians. ""We feel ourselves bound to help
Azerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)
help may take in the future,"" he said.

He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, ""and the whole world knows
about it.""

Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not get
militarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be 
based on street-level excitement, he said.

There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based on
Armenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers were
captured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and 
helicopters.

The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the border
with Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by local
people that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has 
occurred, the sources said.

The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flared
early this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and later
positioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.

From _Myths and Facts_, by Leonard J. Davis, Near East Research Inc.,
1989:

[pp. 108-109]

    ""Unlike the PLO's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets, the
100 troups from the Irgun and Stern group that struck at Deir Yassin
on April 10, 1948, targeted the village for its military importance.
Deir Yassin was on the road to Jerusalem, which the Arabs had
blockaded, and it housed Iraqi troups and Palestinian irregulars.
Snipers based in Deir Yassin were a constant threat to Jewish citizens
in Jerusalem.

    ""Arab civilians were killed at Deir Yassin, but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the Arabs have tried to
paint. The number of Arabs killed was generally reported to be about
250. In 1983, however, Eric Silver of _The Guardian_ (Britain)
interviewed a survivor, Mophammed Sammour, who testified that 116 out
of a population of 800-1000 were killed. 'About three days after the
massacre,' Sammour explained, 'representatives of each of the five
clans in Deir Yassin met at the Moslem offices in Jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found (alive). We went through the
names.  Nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure
was wrong.'

    ""Unlike the PLO's deliberate attacks on civilians, the killing of
civilians at Deir Yassin was not premeditated. The attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left
unharmed. After the remaining Arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the Jewish troops, some of the attackers killed Arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately. Independent observers told _The Guardian_
that among the bodies they found Arab men disguised as women.""

Hehehe.

BTW, does the Litani River not flow West and not South? I think that its waters
stay entirely within Lebanese territory and so what Hasan says about the Jordan
River makes no sense, in any case. The Hasbani River, on the other hand, flows
into the Jordan, if I am not mistaken.

                An Appeal to Mankind

During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,
documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.

The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.

Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.
Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also
been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.
Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives 
of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central
Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific
experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection 
of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.

We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are
violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,
its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of
Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over 
the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the
USSR and the United States. 

One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent 
events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on
Azerbaijan.

It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the
issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their
representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan
SSR.

We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we 
are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic 
Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.

But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists
encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000
Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the 
neighboring lands.

The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,
suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.

But what about the lives of seven million human beings?
If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are
less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their 
colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other
attributes?

All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal
of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous
appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus
in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the
Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved
by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict
lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which
were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of
thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights. 

Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred
thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and
Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims
at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole
thing has now gone entirely too far.

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 
78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this 
time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the 
plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs. 

Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992

                    MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED

     Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today 
of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.
     The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed
1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and 
massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered
mountain passes.
     But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani
reports of a massacre.

                         Scalping Reported
     Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them 
from retrieving more bodies.
     ""Women and children have been scalped,"" said Assad Faradshev, an aide
to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. ""When we began to pick up bodies,
they began firing at us.""
     The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: ""The bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this.""
                         
                         Truckloads of Bodies
     Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,
Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani
bodies.
     ""In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as
many in the second,"" she said. ""Some had their head cut off, and many had
been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.

	In fact, if a speach was not offensive to some, its
protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless. It is
speach that some find questionable that must be protected, be
it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. It is only
through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can

Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on

Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most
official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).

Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one
other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological
Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried ""in camera"". I wouldn't exactly
call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate

in camera.

Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the
KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens
residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,
or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.

Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be
confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the
Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he
couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).

Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on
kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a
kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so
in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous
membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.

The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the
religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the
Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their
religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious
establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.

I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd
like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not
held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of
Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that
was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

If a 'dog's prayers were answered, bones would rain from the sky.
Did you know that the word 'Karabag' itself is a 'Turkish' name? 
Before 1827, before the Russians and their 'zavalli kole' Armenians, 
drove all the Turks/Muslims out, it was a Turkish majority town. Well,
anyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the 
Nazis.

 ""Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously
  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,
  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and 
  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.""[1]

[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' 
    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.
  
As a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) 
was the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in
Boston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but 
had followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally
Tzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect
of the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian
who became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.
In 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central
Committee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the 
American-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local
Armenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20
chapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters
and became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.
Nezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:

 ""The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.
  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.""[1]

Now wait, there is more.

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali
Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return.""

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention in
Somalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there is
no security interest of the United States there which justifies risking the
lives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us
to take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much
greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far
better reasons to take action than the US.

You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to
intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this
word, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as
racist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I
said the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result
of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and
3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side
would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the
conflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite
the fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was
considerably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news
I see are any guide.

This has been discussed before, by several people, on this net.  The
statement is attributable either to Hajj Amin al-Husseini, former Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem - and the leader of the Palestinian death squads
during the 1948 war, or to one of his chief henchmen.  

It was not coined by B'nai B'rith or, for that matter, any Jewish
organization.

I spent almost all of February doing overhaul. The 27th was a short day at
work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided
to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal
Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had
walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes
behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24
Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the 
car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,
and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and 
her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 
45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help
them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?

When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, 
but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the 
Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle
around it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Well
they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""Brother
Muslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. I
didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to 
get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. 
New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And
the comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There's
no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All 
Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this 
was no joke. I quietly left and went home.

Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, 
that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of 
things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.

My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. 
I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two
o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and 
shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,
like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a 
demonstration and move slowly.

My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some
outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd
people are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" I
waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street 
on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned 
and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 
Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there 
was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same 
kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside 
from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young
people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.

My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of
uneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe 
an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say
exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on
the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.

I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,
and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time 
there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more 
aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.
They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run 
again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I 
followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was 
leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one 
side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square 
and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There 
was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.
I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need 
perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they 
mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. 
But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense 
of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just 
in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it 
anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.

Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' 
apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't 
hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and 
drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then
another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off
to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and 
I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.
There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try 
to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.

Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no
demonstration, and I had to protect my family.

I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next
to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-
lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-
thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because
after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons
in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City 
Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I 
saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the 
cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 
to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried 
off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing
right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe 
about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. 
When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was 
about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He 
has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I 
have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of 
people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled 
around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.

Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. 
I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, 
I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. 
And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the 
street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, 
which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to 
Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really
know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is
Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark
blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His 
family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on 
Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; 
their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the 
left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a 
new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son 
was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because 
before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being 
done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.

Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass, 
they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't 
want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And 
this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't 
see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't 
handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking 
and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and 
hashish to put in a store window!

So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one 
would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, 
the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't 
breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. 
True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-
vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people 
died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I 
couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be 
specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of 
Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.

When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs."" 
We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the 
evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.
I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I 
look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to 
the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. 
The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed 
toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, 
wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as 
though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more 
noise, and the glass was flying again.

We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,
there was really no way to defend yourself there.

In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. 
On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or 
what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the 
bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying 
there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing
you couldn't even see him.

That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years.

The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. 

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United 
States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative 
Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

""Forced to go to Palestine.""  How dreadful.  Unlike other

Should we assume that you are refering here to Jews who were kicked

I have never heard of NOT being a Jew as a crime.  Certainly in

Were you involved in the murder of Sarik Ariyak? 

   	December 17, 1980 - Sydney
	Two Nazi Armenians massacre Sarik Ariyak and his bodyguard, Engin 
        Sever. JCAG and SDPA claim responsibility.

It is public knowledge that the founder of the Marxist-Leninist terrorist 
organization, the ASALA (an integral part of ASALA/SDPA/ARF), Hagop
Hagopian, began his notorious career as a member of the terrorist 
group which perpetrated the massacre of the Israeli athletes at the
Munich Olympics in 1972. And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the 
children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF
terrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish and
Kurdish people. 

THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA

    01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in
Istanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6
million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have
murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad... 

Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists
use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)
to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,
Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had
entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they
are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter
innocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role 
in this scheme?

Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration, 
indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with 
those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine 
barracks in Beirut. You won't be able to get away with your crimes 
forever; the justice is long overdue.

The Litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
not run through the buffer zone.  The Hasbani does flow into the Jordan
but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
climatic changes in rainfall.

[FARID] In support of the preservation of the territorial integrity of 
[FARID] Azerbaijan and its independence from Russian rule, the Iranians which 
[FARID] includes millions of Azerbaijanis will have Armenia retreat from the 
[FARID] territory of Azerbaijan. 

Oh, they will? This should prove quite interesting!

[FARID] To count on Iranian help to supposedly counter Turkish influence will 
[FARID] be a fatal error on the part of Armenia as long as Armenia in 
[FARID] violation of international law has Azerbaijani lands in occupation. 

Armenia is not counting on Iranian help. As far as violations of international
laws, which international law gives Azerbaijan the right to attack and 
depopulate the Armenians in Karabakh?

[FARID] If Armenian aggression continues in the territory of Azerbaijan, not 
[FARID] only there won't be any aid from Iran to Armenia but also steps will 
[FARID] be taken to have Armenian army back in Armenia. 

And who do you speak for? Rafsanjani?

[FARID] The Azerbaijanis of Iran will be the guarantors of this policy. As for 
[FARID] scaring Iranians or Turks from the Russian power, experts on present 
[FARID] and future military potentials of these people would not put much 
[FARID] stock on the Russain power as the sole power in the region for long!!! 

Well, Farid, your supposed experts are not expert! The Russians have had
non-stop influence in the Caucasus since the Treaty of Turkmanchay in 1828.
Hmm... that makes it 1993-1828 = 165 years! 

Oh, I see the Azeris from Iran are going to force out the Armenians from 
Karabakh! That will be a real good trick! 

[FARID] Iran is not alian to developing the capability to produce the A bomb 
[FARID] and a reliable delivery system (refer to recent news releases 
[FARID] regarding the potential of Iran). 

So the Azeris from Iran are going to force the Armenians from Karabakh by
forcing the Iranian government to drop an atomic bomb on these Armenians.

[FARID] The moral of the story is that, you don't go invading your neighbor's 
[FARID] home (Azerbaijan) and flash Russia's guns when questioned about it. 

Oh, but it's just fine if you drop an atomic bomb on your neighbor! You are
a damn fool, Farid!

[FARID] (Marshal Shapashnikov may have to eat his words regarding Turkey in a 
[FARID] few short years!). 

So you are going to drop an atomic bomb on Russia as well. 

[FARID] Peaceful resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is the only

And the Armenians will take your ""peaceful"" dropping of an atomic bomb as

All your article reflects is your abundant ignorance. The people of 
Turkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never 
abandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally 
hopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the
parties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole 
perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July 
15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop 
Makarios.

Following the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with 
the aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right 
given by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently 
and conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For 
those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island 
since 1571. 

The release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization
of Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in Greece. One should not
forget that Sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the Turks
in Cyprus, committed murder to achieve this goal, and tried to
destroy the island's independence by annexing it to Greece. Of
course, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences 
for this irresponsible conduct.


            THE MUSEUM OF BARBARISM

2 Irfan Bey Street, Kumsal Area, Nicosia, Cyprus

It is the  house of Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a major who  was serving at
the Cyprus  Turkish Army Contingent. During  the attacks launched
against the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat
Ilhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally
killed in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage
Greeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the
24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

AN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY
GREEK TERRORISTS

The date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the
Greeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been
going on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men
and children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal
Area of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage
bloodshed...

The wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a
major on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,
are  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the
bathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their
home. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.

Let us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by
Mr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded
during the same terrible event.

""On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan
and I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.
Our neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.
Ayshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting
having supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River
direction started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.
Thinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was
dangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought
would be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in
the bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We
waited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing
in the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her
arms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.
Greeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house
with  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard
voices saying, in  Greek, ""You want Taksim eh!""  and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children
fell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,
who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I
heard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.

When I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the
neighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what
had happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to
the  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was
brutally murdered.

In the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying
""Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?""  I became terrified. I
thought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not
dead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself
under the double-bed.

An our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My
mouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some
water. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the
bathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I
offered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who
were all wounded.

We  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I
thought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed
to be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber
and I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked
as far as Koshklu Chiftlik.

There, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were
operated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there
were more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.
Ayshe and her daughter.

After staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to
Ankara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months
treatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,
Greeks arrested me at the Airport.

All  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my
detention. They then released me.""

ON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER

We went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in
which 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five
days.

We  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some
terrible sights.

In the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way
into  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A
child's bicycle lay in a corner.

In the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

In a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the
head.

This, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

Today was five days later, and still they lay there.

 THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.

 Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues. Right now we
 are witnessing the exodus of Turks from the villages. Thousands of people
 abandoning homes, land, herds; Greek Cypriot terrorism is relentless. This 
 time, the rhetoric of the Hellenes and the bust of Plato do not suffice to 
 cover up barbaric and ferocious behaviors.

 DAILY HERALD (London)

 AN APPALLING SIGHT

And when I came across the Turkish homes they were an appalling sight.
Apart from the walls, they just did not exist. I doubt if a napalm bomb
attack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick
and concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately
fired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted
mass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey
ashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.

In the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 
wrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From
this village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village
did I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.


 DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)
 
 GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE

 Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the
 Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found
 crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were
 brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three 
 more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could
 not be removed. Turkish Cypriots guarded by paratroops are still trying to 
 locate the bodies of 20 more believed to have been buried on the same site.

""On the nights 11-12 March, 1918 alone Armenian butchers 
 bayoneted and axed to death 3000 Muslims in areas surrounding
 Erzincan. These barbars threw their victims into pits, most

 200 such pits. This is an act against our world of civilization.""

        (Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander
        of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,
        Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)

""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the
 liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the
 allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of
 the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian
 was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

 While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained
 in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the
 area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to 
 attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the
 plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
 of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by
 the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers
 who had remained in the rear during the war.

 One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of
 soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
 seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,
 and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud
 and dirt...

 It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
 traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
 and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night
 patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The 
 Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
 also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the
 trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for
 fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder
 and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.

 Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir
 Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander
 in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
 The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals
 that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its
 highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
 of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.

 ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,
 Odishelidge. They were as follows:

 The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the
 act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...
 More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been
 killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless 
 Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the
 murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood 
 near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:
 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten
 more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when
 the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

 The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
 fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.
 Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw
 towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew
 to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and
 destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.

 During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages
 that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the 
 Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers
 were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time
 when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
 the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries
 of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the 
 Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would
 have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from
 acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
 hatred and loathing.

 Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that
 he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The
 Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the
 stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since
 the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed
 in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen
 of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping
 him with the iron heel of his boot.

 Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape
 from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off
 by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
 children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village
 of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:

 There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.
 Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and
 spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about
 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 
 centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,
 children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of
 rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.

 A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators
 for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov
 to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be 
 proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's
 disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,
 instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely
 reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told
 the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more
 licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent
 and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
 and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,
 the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
 claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

 An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command
 narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:

 The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut
 out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
 The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men 
 of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they
 took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
 among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
 my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were 
 released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. 
 Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
 Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered
 on the streets.

 On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent
 Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
 threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for
 murdering an innocent Turk. 

 When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would 
 be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare
 you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the 
 Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard
 that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within
 the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same 
 day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to
 him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
 act. However no result was achieved.

 In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a
 natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived
 the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the 
 Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had
 been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. 
 The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
 one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached
 three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details
 of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers
 were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
 withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
 people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading
 Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
 However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
 the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower
 classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders
 of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. 

 I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals
 were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who
 opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that
 it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.
 Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian
 cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have
 supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred
 to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by
 the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.
 You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a
 conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
 of the Turkish soldiers.""

    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,
    and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence
    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder
    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and
    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move
    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts
    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find 
    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than
    anti-Israel bigotry.

    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by

    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is
    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have
    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave
    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the
    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing
    but an anti-Israel charade.

    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli
    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials
    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your
    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan

    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to
    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the
    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,
    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had
    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved
    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make
    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR
    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved
    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth
    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back
    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of
    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called
    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary
    in Lebanon.  

    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other
    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of
    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just
    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney
    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an
    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort
    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to
    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons
    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard
    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich 
    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight 
    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or
    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT
    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is
    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.

    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your
    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a
    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or
    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take
    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do
    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is
    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a 
    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You
    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of 
    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single
    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it
    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most
    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it
    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast
    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic
    manner.

    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is
    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had
    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land
    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS
    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a 
    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do
    continuously refer to international law, would you please say

    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,
    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an
    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,
    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what
    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the
    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims 
    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death
    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk
    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel
    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to 
    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The
    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being
    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.
    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept
    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.
    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the
    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your 
    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    

    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual
    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself
    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the
    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your
    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe
    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born
    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is
    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a
    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these
    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your 
    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, 
    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to 
    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other 
    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do 
    some good.
 
    But for now, you are a fruad.

I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were
not addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned
by the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is 
often on the receiving end of Israel's bombs.
In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is 
disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.
It seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem
on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,
and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.
I will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of
what the situation really is in South Lebanon.

I am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information
we are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the 
people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to
imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....
SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
an 8 year old girl just happened to be.
We are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is 
the Israeli way of telling us that ""if you're gonna hurt our soldiers
you're gonna pay the price"".  We accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young 
men to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.
Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.
The people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a 
regular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that
the so called ""Security Zone"" is necessary for the protection of 
Northern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,
than it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the 
establishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect
our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the
best policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the
establishment of peace keeping troops along the border.

I have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled.
This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
would have resulted in.  
If Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw 
unilaterally from the so-called ""Security Zone"" before the conclusion
of the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,
advance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's 
public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations 
since Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in 
peace and has already offered some important concessions.
Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah
be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not 
accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone
and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.
There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of Lebanon.

Yes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.
The real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave
Israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an 
occupying soldier is attacked.

	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave when the
Lebanese government shows that it can prevent attacks on Israel, and
when the Syrians agree to leave.

	The Lebanese have not tried diplomacy for very long, or maybe
they're not capable of getting rid of the Syrians and Iranians who
occupy their land.  If they closed down the Hezbolah, and negotiated a
withdrawl of Syrian forces, Israel would be happy to leave.

Steve,

If the Israelis are stupid enough to ""allow"" a second ""Palestinian""
state (the first one is Jordon), then you will probably get your
wish - and the Israelis would get what's coming to them.

However, if the ""Palestinians"" were to somehow demonstrate that 
they could govern themselves AND live in peace with their 
Jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
Jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.

If a landlord sells an apartment building ""vacant"" to another landlord
and fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out
on the street all of a sudden.  The seller may be a scoundrel and a
crook but this doesn't make the buyer a ""thief"", as Israelis are so

The Arabs that lived along the coast in Western Palestine, later to be
called Israel, were shafted by their brother Arabs just as they've
been shafted for decades since then by their Arab bretheren.  Somehow,
though, the Arab call has continued to blame Israel, not only for the
Syrian landowner sell-out in Western Palestine (Israel) but even for
the occupation of Eastern Palestine (Jordan) by the Hashemites.  This
is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.

Anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
his/her sources does not deserve to be believed.  The Gaza strip does
not possess the highest population density in the world.  In fact, it
isn't even close.  Just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
of this statement:  the city of Hong Kong has nearly ten times the
population of the Gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area.  The
centers of numerous cities also possess comparable, if not far higher,
population densities.  Examples include Manhattan Island (NY City), Sao
Paolo, Ciudad de Mexico, Bombay,... 

Need I go on?  The rest of Mr. Davidsson's message is no closer to the
truth than this oft-repeated statement is.

First, my above statement doesnot say that ""the existence of israeli citizens
in the WB revoke their right of life"" but it says ""the israeli occupation
of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically
revokes the right of for its military men"". Clearly, occupation is an
undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. 

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to
protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing
Palestinean human rights.

So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.

Exactly, you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment

Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were a
Zionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts, well i feel sorry for you,
because the same Rabbi Shoham had said ""Yes, Zionism is racism"".
If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism.
If you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me in
condemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in 
x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. 

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""
Where are you?

Yes. To be exact, Armenians slaughtered 2.5 million Muslim people between

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

A-historical bullshit.  Shamir fought the British (who, incidentally,
shipped whole shiploads of Jews back to the Nazis for extermination
and hung those Jewish fighters that they captured and didn't want to
deal with anymore).  Shamir did not attack civilians on airliners,
cruise ships, in airports, sports events, movie theaters, markets,
on buses and children in schoolyards.  Your comparison to a Master
Murderer like Abu Nidal is BLIND!

	One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel
from fighting back is to stop attacking.  If there were no attacks in
the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain
the peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape.

attacked?  Aren't they occupying Lebanon?

conditions.  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep
the peace.  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well.

Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine if
they wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasion
where they were both part of the same ""mandate territory"" - read
colony.

Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading another

all wars of aggression have started.

The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by every
nation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).

So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and 
a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situation
because the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the
Israeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.

They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return
of the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in the
Prince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likud
beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous
population.

The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the 
redefinition of much land used in common as ""public land"". The assertion
that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to
an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an
excuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought
in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the
Geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories
must not be changed. 

No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologists
will change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all of
those that actually have any power have condemned this practice.

Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments that

Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to the
negotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulf
they insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.

If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would have
cut the money supply.

Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.
Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.


The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since the
Palestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely it
is this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be the
return of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and the
dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against
non-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. 

The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has
a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the
Israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will mean
outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying
or using much of the land.

What is the point in throwing out one-sided viewpoints (which means:
ignoring that the ""other side's"" perspective and experience HAS ANY 
LEGITIMACY) while assuming that ""your side"" possesses no faults and 
bears no responbility for ANY of the negative impacts of a particular

that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how. ""Strategic withdrawal""

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.



The Arab that was killed was a probably from the Mossad so it is not count 
as a murder.

If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. But this is not the
issue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH. Read again your original
article. You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's
a reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is 
NOT REASONABLE  by any standards. No matter how you try to justify it.
I may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon.
But no matter what you say, I can not understand your satisfaction for dead
bodies.

I have a question for you. Let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs
untill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means
are not very peaceful). Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed)
bosnian muslims ? I would not enjoy, but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies - 
israelis, lebanese or bosnians.

Probably not--he's just singing someone else's opera. He's good, too; perhaps he should get ""The Best Supporting Singer...""

I can give you a Q/A account that is well documented (just go back and reread some of the articles that appeared after this ""joke""):

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.
With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over
all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or
recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.
By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they
should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish 
people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever
showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected 
to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate 
the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. 
Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To 
assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings 
was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom 
free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

If you have the stomach, I would strongly recommend the following
references on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims. Many more of them
are also available in the 'Erzurum and Van Turkish Genocide Museums.'

Would it be asking too much for you to DOCUMENT these allegations of
""Israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters""? I think you confuse
Israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion
of a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke.

As for the notion that Israel threatens the human rights of Palestinians by
sealing off the Gaza strip, get real. When the Palestinian-on-Palestinian
civil war stops and all Palestinians can behave like mature human beings,
Israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. Not before.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH

ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO 
INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...

As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw 
the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as 
they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to 
journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts 
of the hills.

The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING 
of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians 
last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death 
or missing... 

Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter 
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there 
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer 
ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We 
swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon 
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.

We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round 
again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a 
valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung 
round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired 
repeated blasts.

Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting 
had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in 
fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. 
I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, 
its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on 
""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a 
search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.

Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two 
M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed 
flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second 
crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains 
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters 
were there to give covering fire if necessary.

The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet 
armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani 
official told us that there were now five former Soviet military 
helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have 
signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged 
in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian 
pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.

We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an 
heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer 
white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four 
corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an 
Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies 
on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back 
towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before 
the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.

Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the 
civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were 
covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor 
mortis. They had been shot.

What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, 
and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY 
DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

  Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German-
  Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect
  (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody
  who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
  civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel
  and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic
  vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and
  its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt
  (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:
  to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an
  easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
  that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its
  Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to
  live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,
  Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the
  whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from
  everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
  they are living.
  Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish
  nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big
  social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones
  that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other
  minorities of the country.

  This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the

  of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you
  call a ""Civil Libertarian"" (never heard about them) but I know only
  one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then ""Civil Libertarians""
  is a new denomination for Antisemites. May other Civil Libertarians come

04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir

By NEJLA SAMMAKIA
 Associated Press Writer
   
GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have
begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner 
of the Caucasus.

The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,
Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former
Soviet Union to fight for independence.

Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the
conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared
war with Armenia.

They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which
were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national
borders that had been only lines on a map.

A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and
demand a separate ""Lezghistan"" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.

Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six
demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures
and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of
Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.

Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon
after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.

At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to
discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a
war they say is not theirs.

""I have been drafted, but I won't go,"" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth
glinting in the sun. ""Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have
nothing to do with Armenia.""

More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.

Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals
drafted in 1992 had served.

""The police don't force people to go,"" he said. ""They are afraid of an
uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.""

All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but
disagreed on how the protest came about.

Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was
about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.

Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the
Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.

""We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about
draft orders,"" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.

""We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, 
the Russians.""

In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,
in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep
over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.

By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they
came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the 
600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.

About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.

""We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,"" complained Mais
Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,
included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.

""We want our own country,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about easily.
But Baku won't listen to us.""

Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other
Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same 
jobs and intermarrying to some degree.

But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and
Persian with strong guttural vowels.

Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest
ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary 
school classes in their language.

Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from
Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the 
Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern
Azerbaijan.

There were a couple millions of Greeks living in Asia Minor until 1923.

Compromise on what, the invasion of Cyprus, the involment of Turkey in
Greek politics, the refusal of Turkey to accept 12 miles of territorial
waters as stated by international law, the properties of the Greeks of 
Konstantinople, the ownership of the islands in the Greek lake,sorry, Aegean.

There are some things on which there can not be a compromise.

Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or
indirecly is a ""bad"" person.
It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the
actions of your goverment that make you ""bad"".
People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you
are. You are a supporter of the policies of the Turkish goverment and
as a such you must pay the price.

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to
Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under
Turkish occupation.
They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.

You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from
people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.

  Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as
  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement
  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel
  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:

  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform
     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female
     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but
     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of
     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further
     provocation is required.

  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant
     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans
     without positive identification as military personnel, clear
     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.

    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for
       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively
       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or
       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note
       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,
       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive
       military identification and require closer inspection such
       as document checks.

    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,
       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less
       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a
       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,
       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.
       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to
       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify
       armed response.

    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
       military identification of all personnel in the target area of
       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not
       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft
       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the
       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of
       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov
       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to
       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should
       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.
       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters
       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated
       if necessary.

   First, my above statement doesnot say that ""the existence of israeli citizens
   in the WB revoke their right of life"" but it says ""the israeli occupation
   of the WB revoke the right of life for some/most its citizens - basically
   revokes the right of for its military men"". Clearly, occupation is an
   undeclared war; during war, attacks against military targets are fully legitimate. 

Ok, let me re-phrase the question. I have repeatedly asked you if the 
Israelis have less human rights than the palestinians, and if so, why.
From your posting (where you did not directly adress my question) I inferred
that you thought so. Together with the above statement I then assumed that the
reason was the actions of the state of Israel. Re: your statement of 
occupation: I'd like you to define the term, so I don't have to repeat this
'drag the answer out of hasan' procedure more than neccesary.

   Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment to
   protect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressing
   Palestinean human rights.

I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense. Please rephrase it.


   |> If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
   |> tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?


   Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.

Oh, ok. So how about the human rights of the Syrians, Iraqis and others?
Does the name of Hama sound familiar? Or how about the kurds in Iraq and
Turkey? 
How about the Same in Sweden (Ok, maybe a bit farfetched..) the Russians in
the Baltic states or the Moslem in the old USSR and Yugoslavia?
Do the serbs have any human rights remainaing, according to you?

   So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.
   (i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).

No, I'm agreeing that to just kick all the Palestinians out of Israel proper 
would probably lead to disaster for both parties. If that's what you refer 
to as the 'Israeli solution' then so be it.

An unjust solution would be a non-solution, per definition, no?

There exists an A such that property B does not hold.

Thus, either or both statements must be false.

I was merely pointing out a not so small flaw in your reasoning.
Since you claim to be logical I felt it best to point this out

Am I then to assume you are  not logical?

Any quote can be misused, especially when used to stereotype all 
individuals by a statement of an individual. If you use the same
methods that you credit 'Zionists' with, then where does that place you?

Oh, by the way, I'd advice you not to assume anything about my 'loyalties'.
I will and am condemning acts I find vile and inhuman, but I'll try as 
long as I can not to assume those acts are by a whole people.
By zionist above do you mean the state of Israel, the government of Israel, 
the leaders of Israel (political and/or religious) or the jews in
general? If you feel the need to condemn, condemn those responsible
instead. How would you feel if we started condemning you personally
based on the bombings in Egypt?

You seem to oppose ending the embargo.  You know, it is difficult for Europeans

But if this was the reason, and if furthermore both sides are equal, wouldn't

of the non-Christians we really seem to favor?

The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military
intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who 
advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require
an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and
think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten
a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's
milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will
simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this
futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to
die. A price I am unwilling to even consider.

>Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community

There is no valid comparison to the Holocaust. All of the Jewish people
that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of
others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw
uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned).
It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.
Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children,
lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.

Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have
one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease
their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing
ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps
when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden
attack of brains. Send in missiles by all means, but do not send in
troops.

What you may not be taking into account is that the JP is no longer
representative of the mainstream in Israel.  It was purchased a few
years ago and in the battle for control, most of the liberal and
left-wing reporters walked out.  The new owner stated in the past,
more than once, that the JP's task should be geared towards explaining
and promoting Israel's position, more than attacking the gov't (Likud
at the time).  The paper that I would recommend reading, being middle
stream and factual is ""Ha-Aretz"" - or at least this was the case two
years ago.

But seriously, if one were to read some of the leftist newspapers
one could arrive at other conclusions.  The information you received
was highly selective and extrapolating from it is a bad move.

The fact that Israel is already discussing with some Palestinians what the composition
of the armed Palestinian Police Force in the territories will be during the transition
phase indicates some real solid concessions and liberal thinking on the part of the
Israeli side.

He-he. The great humanist speaks. One has to read Mr. Salah's posters,
in which he decribes Jews as ""sons of pigs and monkeys"", keeps
promising the ""final battle"" between Muslims and Jews (in which the
stons and the trees will ""cry for the Muslims to come and kill the
Jews hiding behind them""), makes jokes about Jews dying from heart
attacks etc, to realize his objective stance on the matters involved.

Dear Marc,
	I believe that you are wrong about Mr. Freeman.  He has written in
a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  If you just don't seem
to get it, I believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
than of him.  His posts contain substance and and he defends his positions 
well.
	Having said this, I would like to ask in general for people on this 
board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack
the author of the posts.  When one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the
ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.

Peace,


Danny

p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).

 'The most are inside houses. Come you and look.'
 'No, dammit! My stomach isn't-'
 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform. Him you must see.'
 ""We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....
 'I don't believe you,"" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door. The 
  man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse. 
  I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and 
  went inside.

 The place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes, and was dark at first, for 
 its stone walls had only window slits. Rags strewed the mud floor around an 
 iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black 
 with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As 
 the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face 
 up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what 
 was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, 
 as with Tartars rather than with Turks. Any uniform once on him was gone, so 
 I'd no proof which he was, and quickly went out, gagging at the mess of his  
 slashed genitals.""

p. 363 (first paragraph). 

 'How many people lived there?'
 'Oh, about eight hundred.' He yawned.
 'Did you see any Turk officers?'
 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'

 ""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
 Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled
 so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into 
 laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense
 of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
 Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
 have been.

 From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
 The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
 the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
 scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
 looms, even spinning-wheels.

 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must 
 leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And 
 for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. 
 Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
 a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'""

p. 354.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
 high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,
 but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
 of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on
 Moslem villages.""

p. 358.

""It will be three hours to take,"" Dro told me. We'd close in on three
 sides.
""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov
said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""
""Soldiers or civilians?"" I asked.
""There is no difference,"" said Dro. ""All are armed, in uniform or not.""
""But the women and children?""
""Will fly with the others as best they may.""

p. 360.

""The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet 
 down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said 
 Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'

 Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets
 clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;
 then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the
 spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though 
 I heard our Utica brass roar.

 As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing
 of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,
 dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
 puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
 The came a shrill wailing.

 Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about
 house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in
 clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen
 were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape
 over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked
 breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by
 afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and
 the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.

 At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward
 Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and 
 tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,
 through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
 arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.""

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

""Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
 large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble 
 where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet 
 had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between 
 the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
 dress.

 The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He 
 lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the 
 pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed 
 just below his neck, into the spine. 

 There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was 
 empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking 
 colonel. He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead.""

p. 358.

 ""...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled
  north. My hosts told me of their duty here: to keep tabs on brigands,

Do you have a terminal cold? Karabag is 'Turkish' and will remain 
'Turkish'. Here we are, almost at the end of the 20th century, and 
a whole community, the Azeri Turks of x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag, 
is facing forced assimilation, torture and murder on one hand and 
forced exodus, expulsion and genocide on the other, all because 
of their ethnic and religious background. And one should ask herself: 
is the world community really so powerless? Where are all those human 
rights advocates? Where are all the decent people? Are we going to 
let this human tragedy go on and do nothing about it? The number
of Azeris murdered by the terrorist Armenian army and its savage
gangs is increasing. On the one hand they wish to distort the truth
and on the other, they beg mercy from Turkiye.

        The Age...Melbourne...6/3/92

        By Helen WOMACK  .... Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday

        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be 
        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian 
        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. 

        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the 
        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of 
        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 
        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the 
        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in 
        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were 
        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I 
        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift 
        hospital in a string of railway carriages. 

        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by 
        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov 
        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to 
        his  town.   "" So where are the rest?"".  Some might have  taken 
        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the 
        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to 
        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of 
        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. 

        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at 
        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting 
        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. 
        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored 
        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend 
        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the 
        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. 

        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken 
        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that 
        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack 
        Khojaly. ""It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.""

I realize that incidences such as the one described in the
letter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to
ignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the
Europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think
that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
atrocities.
	What is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of
the inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing
received from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt
go away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races
when they got power. It is unfortunate.

As usual, when Salah is not totally racist, she manages to get

Assad pledged to allow Jews to leave Syria, but not to go to Israel.

Unfortunately, not all of them have escaped yet, but not because they
don't want to leave;  rather, Assad went back on his word and stopped
issuing travel permits.  He claimed bureaucratic snags, but everyone

Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights
violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights
violations.

Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab
States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can
claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.

I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of
peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.
I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to
it. Peace AND justice. 

If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present
his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully 
entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has
a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they
wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the
Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since
Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations
quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a
legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. 

Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor
are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.
Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be
implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. 

Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first
party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and
the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some
symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise
the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people
and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own
past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to
acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal
of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.

When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages
destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock. 
I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the
meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.

NEW DETAILS OF EXTENSIVE ADL SPY OPERATION EMERGE

	* INQUIRY: Transcripts reveal nearly 40 years of espionage
	  by a man who infiltrated political groups

By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.

SAN FRANCISCO -- To the outside world, Roy Bullock was a small-time
art dealer who operated from his house in the Castro District.  In
reality, he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and
amassed secret files for the Anti-Defamation League for nearly 40
years.

His code name at the prominent Jewish organization was Cal, and he was
so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen
to head an Arab-American delegation that visited Rep. Nancy Pelosi
(D-San Francisco) in her Washington, D.C., office.

For a time, Cal tapped into the phone message system of the White
Aryan Resistance to learn of hate crimes.  From police sources he
obtained privileged, personal information on at least 1,394 people. 
And he met surreptitiously with agents of the South African government
to trade his knowledge for crisp, new $100 bills.

These are among the secrets that Bullock and David Gurvitz, a former
Los Angeles-based operative, divulged in extensive interviews with
police and the FBI in a growing scandal over the nation-wide
intelligence network operated by the Anti-Defamation League.

Officials of the Anti-Defamation League, while denying any improper
activity, have said they will cooperate with the investigation.  They
have refused to discuss Bullock and Gurvitz.

Transcripts of the interviews -- among nearly 700 pages of documents
released by San Francisco prosecutors last week -- offer new details
of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line
into illegal territory.

At times, the intelligence activities took on a cloak-and-dagger air
with laundered payments, shredded documents, hotel rendezvous with
foreign agents and code names like ""Ironsides"" and ""Flipper.""

On one occasion, Gurvitz recounts, he received a tip that a
pro-Palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for Haifa,
Israel.  Although the Anti-Defamation League publicly denies any ties
to Israel, Gurvitz phoned an Israeli consular official to warn him. 
Shortly afterward, another official called Gurvitz back and debriefed
him.

The court papers also added to the mystery of Tom Gerard, a former CIA
agent and San Francisco police officer accused of providing
confidential material from police files to the Anti-Defamation League.

Gerard fled to the Philippines last fall after he was interviewed by
the FBI, but left behind a briefcase in his police locker.  Its
contents included passports, driver's licenses and identification
cards in 10 different names; identification cards in his own name for
four American embassies in Central America; and a collection of blank
birth certificates, Army discharge papers and official stationery from
various agencies.

Also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads, a
black hood, apparently for use in interrogations, and photos of
blindfolded and chained men.

Investigators suspect that Gerard and other police sources gave the
ADL confidential driver's license or vehicle registration information
on a vast number of people, including as many as 4,500 members of one
target group, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee.

Each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would
constitute a felony, San Francisco Police Inspector Ron Roth noted in
an affidavit for a search warrant.

The Anti-Defamation League, a self-described Jewish defense and civil
rights organization, acknowledges it has long collected information on
groups that are anti-Semitic, extremist or racist. The ADL's
fact-finding division, headed by Irwinn Suall in New York, enjoys a
reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with
police agencies and journalists. 

However, evidence seized from Bullock's computer shows he kept files
on at least 950 groups of all political stripes, including the
American Civil Liberties Union, Earth Island Institute, the United
Farm Workers, Jews for Jesus, Mother Jones magazine, the Center for
Investigative Reporting, the Bo Gritz for President Committee, the
Asian Law Caucus and the AIDS activist group ACT UP.

The computer files also included information on several members of
Congress, including Pelosi, House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey
from the Bay Area.

In their statements, Bullock and Gurvitz said the Anti-Defamation
League has collected information on political activists in the Los
Angeles area for more than 30 years.  They said they worked closely
with three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies who specialized in
intelligence work, a Los Angeles Police Department anti-terrorism
expert and a San Diego County Sheriff's Department intelligence
officer.

A spokesman for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department said he knew
nothing of any contact between the deputies and the ADL.  The Los
Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the
investigation, and the San Diego Sheriff's Department declined
comment.

Bullock, 58, is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy
drama.  Although he is not Jewish, he began working undercover as a
volunteer for the ADL and the FBI in Indiana in 1954 after reading a
book about a man who infiltrated the Communist Party.

Bullock moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and was given a paid position by
the ADL as an intelligence operative, he told authorities.  In the
mid-1970s, he moved to San Francisco and continued his spy operations
up and down the West Coast.

To keep his identity secret, his salary has always been funneled
through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman -- who has never
missed a payment in more than 32 years, Bullock said.

""I was an investigator for the ADL.  I investigated any and all
anti-democratic movements,"" Bullock said.  "". . . Officially, I'm only
a contract worker with Bruce Hochman.  That way, the league would not
be officially connected with me.""

Bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from Communists
to Arab-American to gay radicals to skinheads, usually using his own
name but once adopting the alias Elmer Fink.

""I'm one of a kind,"" he told police.

In recent years, however, his ADL affiliation has increasingly become
known, and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a
shotgun who threatened to kill him.

In the mid-1980s, he helped San Francisco police solve a bombing at a
synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist Cory Phelps and
matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by
police.  In part because of this investigation, he became close
friends with Gerard, who at the time was working in the San Francisco
police intelligence division.

Bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups.  An
FBI report noted how he investigated one Palestinian group:

""Bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash, and
would share the reports with Gerard.  Bullock also gave the trash to
Gerard for Gerard to examine.  Gerard would later return the trash to
Bullock.""

From a wide range of sources, Bullock compiled files on 9,876
individuals and more than 950 political groups.  Gerard, whose files
contained many identical entries, kept files on 7,011 people.

In 1987, Bullock and Gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of
information to the South African government.  Bullock tells of
meetings secretly with South African agents at San Francisco hotels
and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new $100
bills.

Bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled
only from public sources. Once he rewrote an innocuous item published
by San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen about South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu and the wife of prominent attorney Melvin Belli --
and submitted it as his own work.

Bullock said it was Gerard who sold official police intelligence. 
Bullock said he split about $16,000 from the South African government
evenly with Gerard, telling him at one point, ""I may be gay but I'm a
straight arrow.""

In his interviews with the police and FBI, Bullock talked freely about
engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to
violate the law.

For example, Bullock admitted to receiving driver's license records
and criminal histories from Gerard on about 50 people -- a fraction of
the confidential police data found in his computer.  And he said
Gerard gave him complete San Francisco Police Department intelligence
files on various Nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under
department policy.

Bullock said he also received a confidential FBI report on the Nation
of Islam that he later shredded at the Anti-Defamation League's San
Francisco office.

Bullock seemed proud of his ""Operation Eavesdrop,"" in which he used a
paid informant, code-named Scumbag, to help tap into a White Aryan
Resistance phone message network, listening to the messages left by
members of the right-wing group.  ""For a short time, it was
wonderful,"" he told police.

In Los Angeles, ADL operative Gurvitz was hired about four years ago
as a ""fact-finder"" to keep intelligence files and occasionally go
undercover to the meetings of target groups.

Among other things, he told San Francisco authorities, the Los Angeles
ADL office kept a record of any Arab-American who had ""anti-Israel
leanings"" or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such
sentiment.

Gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he
attempted to misuse the ADL intelligence network to seek revenge on a
rival who got a job Gurvitz wanted at the Simon Wiesenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies.  Gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival
and threatened to expose him as a Jewish spy to a right-wing hate
group.

Gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the FBI in the
probe, providing considerable information about the ADL operation. 
Unlike Bullock, he has been assured he is not a subject of the
investigation.

Gurvitz declined through his father in Los Angeles to be interviewed
by The Times. Bullock's attorney said his client would not comment.

Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the
value or lack of value of Elias's ""proposal"".  I just want to say
that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT
like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  

Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An 
instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to 
Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,
and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were
considered not pure Gypsies but ""mongrels"" formed from the pure Gypsy 
race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between 
the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also 
true that towards the end of WWII even the ""purist"" Gypsies were 
hunted down as the theory was forgotten.

In Ottoman times messengers were usually killed by cutting their heads off and

   Andy Beyer has claimed that the Israeli Press is a bit biased.
But the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the
mideast that people who do not read the Israeli press simply know
nothing about.  Many of these events are not even mentioned here.
I read the Israeli press to learn of important events about which
you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media
for your information on Israel.  Since I read both American media
and Israeli media, I can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the American press for knowledge about
Israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.

   As to the claim that Israeli papers are biased, of course they
are.  Some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media
here in America.  But they still report events about which people
here know nothing.  I choose to form my opinions about Israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average American
who relies exclusively on an American media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.

Judaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but
Judaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who
Christians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing
in one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity
and Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views
and the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each
religion.

We are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are
paid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are
poor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most
often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims
around the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human
sense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money
and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid
(and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer
services)).

The Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that
the Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same
message, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the
Bible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed
their meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the
personal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the
same language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know
that mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed
to Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which
were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later
such as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.

Suffering from a severe case of myopia? No Muslim left alive - not a 
single one. Leading the first Armenian units who crossed the Ottoman 
border in the company of the Russian invaders was the former Ottoman 
Parliamentary representative for Erzurum, Karekin Pastirmaciyan, who 
assumed the revolutionary name Armen Garo. Another former Ottoman 
parliamentarian, Hamparsum Boyaciyan, led the Armenian guerrilla forces 
who ravaged Turkish villages behind the lines under the nickname ""Murad"", 
especially ordering that 

         'Kill Turks and Kurds wherever you find them and in 
          whatever circumstances you find them. Turkish children 
          also should be killed as they form a danger to the 
          Armenian nation.' (Hamparsum Boyadjian - 1914)[1]

 [1] M. Varandian, ""History of the Dashnaktsutiun,"" p. 85.

Another former Member of Parliament, Papazyan, led the Armenian 
guerrilla forces that ravaged the areas of Van, Bitlis and Mush.

In March 1915, the Russian forces began to move toward Van. Immediately,
in April 11, 1915 the Armenians of Van began a revolt, massacring all 
the Turks in the vicinity so as to make possible its quick and easy 
conquest by Russians. Little wonder that Czar Nicholas II sent a 
telegram of thanks to the Armenian Revolutionary Committee of Van in 
April 21, 1915, ""thanking it for its services to Russia."" The Armenian 
newspaper Gochnak, published in the United States, also proudly 
reported in May 24, 1915 that 

""only 1,500 Turks remained in Van the rest having been slaughtered.""

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

Are you people for real? The main legal principles of the Turkish State 
are summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:

	""The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State
	governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public
	peace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;
	loyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental
	tenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.""

Freedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing
the many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The
fact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be
attributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.
The first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.
Although the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force
only temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.

The 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and
the right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution
of 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing
the power of the Parliament and the government.

The First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the
occupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was
abolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the
occupying forces.

During the Independence War, the ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" held their
first meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new
Turkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish
Republic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new
Constitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal 
backbone of today's modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a 
multi-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by
others in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been
based on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national
sovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.

""Major Principles of the Constitution""

The constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic
within the following principles:

- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by 
  law;
- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,
  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;
- The language of the State is Turkish;
- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.
  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;
- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This
  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;
- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;
- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the
  Turkish nation;
- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,
  sex, or political beliefs;
- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.

""Structure of the State""

In accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the
principle of ""division of power"" to create a balanced and self-controlled
system. The power is divided into ""legislative power,"" ""executive power,"" and
""judicial power,"" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each
other (self-control).

 A. Legislative Power:

 The ""Turkish Grand National Assembly"" is a parliament with one House, elected
 by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on
 behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:

 - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;
 - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;
 - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;
 - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;
 - to ratify international agreements;
 - to grant amnesty or pardons.

 Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral
 or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is
 divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is
 calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age
 of twenty-one can vote.

 Elections are supervised by the ""Supreme Council of Elections,"" which solves
 all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local ""Board of Election""
 runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the
 Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among 
 independent judges.

 B. Executive Power:

 The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government
 as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:

 - to represent the State and the Country;
 - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;
 - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;
 - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;
 - to ratify laws and government decrees.
 
 The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven
 years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may 
 call for a referendum.

 Executive power is exercised by the ""Council of Ministers,"" headed by the
 Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the
 members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval
 by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their
 program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)
 Ministers in the Council.

 Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent
 ""administrative"" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or
 functions against any law.

 C. Judicial Power:

 Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can
 instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be 
 discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the
 reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories
 of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:

 - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The 
   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice
   upon the appeal of the parties involved.
 - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime
   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in
   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.
   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the
   high administrative court.

 The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the
 ""Constitutional Court"" if they contradict the Constitution. If found
 contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.

I don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*
governments have been known to follow events on the Usenet.  For
example after Tienanmien Square in Beijing the Chinese government
began monitoring cyberspace.  As the former Director of PeaceNet,
I am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and
international authorities monitoring Usenet and other conferences
such as those on the Institute for Global Communications.  But
what's the big deal?  You shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this
medium in any case.  If you are concerned about being monitored,
you should use encyrption software (available in IGC's ""micro""
conference).  I know for a fact that human rights activists in the
Balkan-Mideast area use encryption software to send out their
reports to international organizations.  Such message *can* be
decoded however by large computers consuming much CPU time, which
probably the Turkish government doesn't have access to.

04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES

By David Ljunggren

MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons
x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it
might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.

Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest
offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in
the Transcaucasian region soaring.

The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the
Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending 
planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.

It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about
the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as 
saying.

""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate
measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft
units.""

Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the
conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which
more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.

The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to
Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.

A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly
on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket
launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.

Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops
and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where
they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.

""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the
country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.

Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops 
involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.

Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive
along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.

""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent
inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)
leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.

Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in
Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of
Commonwealth leaders.

""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the
protection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying.
     
At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have
collapsed.

""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the
legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he
said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not 
been recognised by any other country.

Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future
peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.

Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender
Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with
Armenia, had resigned.

Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.
Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of
Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev. There was no official
confirmation.

Is that what turns you on? The truth needs to be told over and over 
again. There are Armenians who of course witnessed the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people between 1914-1920 but their voices of truth 
are suppressed today in the hollow din of anti-Turkish/Muslim campaign
by the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle of the fascist 
x-Soviet Armenian Government. Well, that is what I saw in the library.
What's your problem with this?

AZERBAIJAN'S GOVERNMENT APPEALS TO COMPATRIOTS ALL OVER THE WORLD

   BAKU (APRIL 5) TURAN: Today, Azerbaijan's government appealed 
to Azeris all over the world in connection with escalation of the 
Armenian aggression against the republic.  
  It is stressed in appeal that the experience of five-years of fighting
for independence from imperial chains shows a grim process . The war
against Azerbaijan under the pretence of protecting the human rights of 
the Armenians of Ukhari (Upper) Garabag, has meant the destruction of
Azeri villages and towns, occupation of 10 percent of the territory, 60
thousand new refugees in addition to 500 thousand already in place.
This is all the price of fighting for liberty from Russian imperial rule,
is said in the document. 
   Azerbaijan's government appeals to all compatriots to make every
effort to inform the people of the world about the truth in Azerbaijan,
and to assistance in solving the problems facing the young state.
   It is stressed in the appeal that there is urgent need for medicine,
food, experienced doctors and financial help to settle refugees from
Kelbajar, Fizuli and Lachin regions, and to render medical aid for the 
sick and the wounded men.--O--

SITUATION IN THE REGION OF KELBAJAR

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attempts to evacuate the rest of 15,000
citizens, encircled on alpine villages of the region of Kelbajar 
went on within the last twenty-four hours. Evacuation helicopters
could not land near these villages because of shelling from the
Armenian side and existence of fog. Measures are undertaken to air-drop
food and medicine to the encircled people.
   Several hundred people succeed within the last twenty-four hours to
get out of the region of Kelbajar via mountain range. Refugees are 
settled in the neighboring regions of Azerbaijan and in Ganja. 
Authorities face serious problem with rendering refugees medical 
aid and food. The number of refugees from Kelbajar is over 40,000 people.
Azerbaijan is not capable of handling a disaster of this magnitude.--0--

of Kelbajar were taken out by 11 o'clock on April 5, informed the chief
of the press-service of president of Azerbaijan, Arif Aliev, today.
   Journalists were also informed at the press-conference that
International Red Cross is helping to accept and render refugees medical
aid. There is an urgent need to supply the refugees with tents, food and
medical aid.
   Arif Aliev informed that as a result of the ongoing tragedy brought
on by the latest aggression of Armenia, the leadership of Azerbaijan
intends to appeal to Azerbaijanis and all those who treasure human life
all over the world for help.
   Concerning the reaction of the international community to aggression 
of Armenia, Aliev said the department of state of the USA has expressed
its anxiety to leadership of Armenia.
   Participants of peace efforts in Daglig (Nagorno) Garabag under
CSCE, Rafaelli, Mareska and Chetin strongly blamed the aggression of 
Armenia against Azerbaijan.
   Leader of press-service informed that tomorrow ambassador of 
Azerbaijan in Russia, Hikmet Haji-zade, will conduct a press-conference

AZERBAIJANIS PICKET IN FRONT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF RUSSIA

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Azerbaijanis, living in Moscow, picketed
in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia.
Picket was conducted as a token of protest against participation of
Russian units in capture of the region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan by
Armenians. About 100 people took part in the picket, organized by
Azerbaijani society ""Dayag"".--0--


PICKET OF SADVALERS IN MOSCOW

   BAKU (5 APRIL) 30-40 members of ""Sadval"" society picketed before
the building of permanent representation of Azerbaijan in Moscow.
Picketers were demanding the return of Lezghins lands, as if annexed
by Azerbaijan.
   Ambassador of Azerbaijan in Moscow, Hikmet Haji-zade classified
this action as provocation aimed at creating a further inter-ethnic
conflict in Azerbaijan. He marked in his talk with the Turan
correspondent that he does not rule out a connection between the
Armenian aggression in the region of Kelbajar and this anti-
azerbaijani action of the ""Sadval"" society in Moscow. He also
marked that 30-40 people do not mean the Lezghian nationality in
the whole.
   Society of Lezghins, ""Sadval"", registered in Moscow in 1990,
demands the creation of a Lezghistan state, which never existed
before on the northern territories of Azerbaijan.--0--


ATTACK OF ARMENIAN UNITS STOPPED

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Attack of Armenian army on the town of 
Fizuli, which began in the last twenty-four hours, is stopped, informs 
the press-service of the Ministry of Defence of Azerbaijan.
   In the result of undertaken measures, 6 tanks and a number of 
the attackers were destroyed. Advance units of the Armenian army
retreated several kilometers.
   Chairman of the parliament, Isa Gambar, visited the town of 
Fizuli and met with commanders of the units of the national army
and local citizens, today.--0--


STATEMENT OF MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (5 APRIL) TURAN: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan 
issued a statement in connection with aggression of Armenia in the
region of Kelbajar of Azerbaijan.
   It is stated in the statement that regular units of the armed
forces of Armenia captured the town of Kelbajar on April 3 .
  Attack of Armenian units, which began on March 27 deep in the
territory of Azerbaijan still continues. Armenia has occupied at
present 7500 sq.km of the territory of Azerbaijan.
   Spreading of Armenian aggression far away from Ukhari (Upper)
Garabag proves that the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflicts has entered a
specially dangerous phase. This is the result of non-recognition of 
Armenia as an aggressor by the international community, is marked
in the document.
   It is stressed in the statement that the units of the 7th Russian
army are participating in the Armenian attack. This casts doubt on
the sincerity of Russian mediation efforts in finding a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
   It is marked in conclusion that aggressive actions of Armenia 
have wrecked the negotiation process under aegis of CSCE.
   The document contains the appeal to the world community to stop
Armenian aggression and to use political and economic sanctions
against the aggressor.--0--

Still living in an alternate universe? Numerous articles in major newspapers 
(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested 
the existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the 
Nazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to 
deal with this issue extensively. Derounian's motives were twofold: his 
deeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt 
obliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.
Concurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call 'crisis control' 
or face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger 
Armenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration 
as deplorable but insignificant.[1]

 Yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
 forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of Armenian-Nazi 
 collaboration.

 A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft
 is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. The 
 magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany
 and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the
 magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,
 is attention-getting.

 This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
 important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be
 an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 

 In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain
 political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They 
 occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.
 The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
 ""Aryan"" and what befell them.

Now wait, there is more.

To Andi,

I have to disagree with you about the value of Israeli news sources. If you
want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news
directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some
extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However, 
the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the ""truth"" and to discern 
the bias. 

Go read or listen to some Israeli media. You will learn more news and more
opinion about Israel and Palestine by doing so. Then you can form your own
opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
change.

   Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest
points, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question
of this sort about the Arab countries.

   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your
fixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it
would not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would
begin to look like the biased attack that it is.

   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for
Policy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot
who hates Israel.

   Why don't you try being honest about your hatred of Israel?  I
have heard that your family once lived in Israel, but the members
of your family could not cut the competition there.  Is this true
about your family?  Is this true about you?  Is this actually not
about Israel, but is really a personal vendetta?  Why are you not
the least bit objective about Israel?  Do you think that the name
of your phony-baloney center hides your bias in the least?  Get a
clue, Mr. Davidsson.  Haven't you realized yet that when you post
such stupidity in this group, you are going to incur answers from
people who are armed with the truth?  Haven't you realized that a
piece of selective data here and a piece there does not make up a
truth?  Haven't you realized that you are in over your head?  The
people who read this group are not as stupid as you would hope or
need them to be.  This is not the place for such pseudo-analysis.
You will be continually ripped to shreds, until you start to show
some regard for objectivity.  Or you can continue to show what an
anti-Israel zealot you are, trying to disguise your bias behind a
pompous name like the 'Center for Policy Research.'  You ought to
know that you are a laughing stock, your 'Center' is considered a
joke, and until you either go away, or make at least some attempt
to be objective, you will have a place of honor among the clowns,
bigots, and idiots of Usenet.

In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.

People die that is all. No one gets killed.

Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It
seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities
while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,
will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
is a part of it.

Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
within their borders?  

[...]

You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?
Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey
has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is 
the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the
negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri 
towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the 
line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically
and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be
neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their
blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians
in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in
the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for
compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
inflammatory half-truths.

cheers,

Subject: rejoinder. Questions to Israelis


Dear Josh

I appreciate the fact that you sought to answer my questions.

Having said that, I am not totally happy with your answers.

1.   You did not fully answer my question whether Israeli ID cards
identify the holders as Jews or Arabs. You imply that U.S.
citizens must identify themselves by RACE. Is that true ? Or are
just trying to mislead the reader ? Do you know of any democratic
country where people are asked to reveal their ethnical or
religious identity to any public official who so requests ?

2.  The answer to the second question is evasive. There are all
kinds of maps issued.  They are not equivalent to State policy.
You did not respond to my question.

3.  Your answer to the third question (Israeli nuclear arsenal) is
interesting. You say that Israeli 'probably' stocks nuclear
weapons. What evidence have you for maintaining that ?

4.  My fourth question was answered by someone else who posted a
Ma'ariv article documenting such cases. I did not ask about cases
like Vanunu (everybody knew he was tried and imprisoned) but about
those about whom nobody even knows that they have been tried and
imprisoned.

5.  Thanks for clarifying the question concerning the legal status
of the inhabitants of the occupied territories. From it I
understand that there are two sets of laws in these ares, one for
the occupier (civil law) and one for the occupied (military law).
The law allows Israeli Arabs to settle in Hebron, it seems. If so,
why doesn't it allow Hebron Arabs to settle in Israel ?

6. Your answer to the question concerning rights to return
conflicts with what I was told, namely that hundreds of thousands
of non-Jews who left for some reason or other the area under
Israel control during the war of 1947-8, were prevented from
returning for the sole reason they were not Jews. Jews who also
left, for example to Europe, to avoid the clashes, were allowed to
return. How can you justify such discrimination, if this is true ?
Is the mere fact of a person leaving area of combat to seek refuge
somewhere else a reason for stripping him of his right to live in
his homeland ?

7.  Somebody answered my 7.question regarding Y. Rabin signing an
order for ethnical cleansing in 1948. According to that
information, Y. Rabin signed the order for the expulsion of all
inhabitants of Lydda and Ramleh, about 50,000 people.  These
expulsions were helped by massacres of civilians and other
atrocities which remind Bosnia. I was referred to a book by
Israeli journalist Benny Goodman called The Origin of the
Palestinian Refugee Problem, published by Cambridge University
Press. Is this book available in your library ?

8.  You maintain that there are some Israeli Arabs living in
Israeli kibbutzim. I wonder how many and where. There is very
little evidence available about that. As much as I know, many
Arabs are working *for* kibbutzim, even for many years, but are
not accepted as members. Could it be that kibbutzim do not want
Arabs ?

9.  My question about the lack of civil marriage in Israel was
whether it is true that the Israeli legislator intended to
discourage intermarriage. You did not address this question but
evaded it by saying that the 'entire religious establishment wants
to keep it what way'. I am certain that if only religious
communities in the U.S. would be asked, they would gladly abolish
civil marriage so that people would depend upon rabbis and priests
to officiate marriages. But Israel has always been ruled by a
secular majority. Your answer is not satisfactory.


I would be glad to have some more input from you after these
comments.

Elias

I donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me.
Israelis are being killed because Israel is occupying , Let israel withdraw
and israeli blood will be saved. It isNOT the palestineans who undermined
the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed 
the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !

More generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada,
and i had previously posted a ""long"" article about this issue, whom i finished
by an open question:
Suppose the Intifada stops, What is the motive for Israel to withdraw ?
donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. Everybody in the world looks
and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary
but not sufficient motive.

As for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern. 
the Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.
As for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language
but it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those
surely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself
to see such attrocities than to participate in.

My definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.
In politics, a ""solution"" doesNOT imply ""JUST solution"".

It seems that it was problem in the definition of ""solution"".
I think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.
However, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but 
just a solution.

Chris, solid job at discussing the inherent Nazism in Mr. Davidsson's post.
Oddly, he has posted an address for hate mail, which I think we should

Subject: Re: Himmler's speech on the extirpation of the Jewish race
Organization: Brown University Department of Computer Science
Lines: 56

It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other ""inferior races"" 
and ""human animals"" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:


From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS
Major-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943
[""Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression"", Vol. IV, p. 559]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we
must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own
blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,
does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer
in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping
their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in
prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we
need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest
to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion
while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as
the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough
and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,
who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude
towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these
human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry
about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and
grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone
comes to me and says, ""I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women
and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them"", then I
would have to say, ""you are a murderer of your own blood because
if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and
they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood"".



Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940
[""Trials of Wa Criminals"", Vol. IV, p. 1140]
------------------------------------------------------------------
If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this
I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in
front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,
provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women
and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this
kind is out of the question.

The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and
where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline
cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.
This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those
hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict
untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail
in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -
we all know that - but we need them.

Ten questions to Israelis
-------------------------

I would be thankful if any of you who live in Israel could help to
provide
 accurate answers to the following specific questions. These are
indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
people around me.

1.      Is it true that the Israeli authorities don't recognize
Israeli nationality ? And that ID cards, which Israeli citizens
must carry at all times, identify people as Jews or Arabs, not as
Israelis ?

2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders
and that Israeli governments from 1948 until today have refused to
state where the ultimate borders of the State of Israel should be
?

3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,
could you provide any evidence ?

4.      Is it true that in Israeli prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ?

5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the occupied
territories are subject to different laws than non-Jews?

6.      Is it true that Jews who left Palestine in the war 1947/48
to avoid the war were automatically allowed to return, while their
Christian neighbors who did the same were not allowed to return ?

7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
an order for ethnical cleansing in 1948, as is done today in
Bosnia-Herzegovina ?

8.      Is it true that Israeli Arab citizens are not admitted as
members in kibbutzim?

9.      Is it true that Israeli law attempts to discourage
marriages between Jews and non-Jews ?

10.     Is it true that Hotel Hilton in Tel Aviv is built on the
site of a muslim cemetery ?

  Note the clause ""more forcibly"", above.     My point is that they have
  made a few pro-forma, perfunctory remarks, and sent in a few C-130's and
  so forth, but it's clearly not something they're losing much sleep over.
  They're just going through the motions, while Moslems are being ""ethnically

  out far more loudly than the Moslem nations in the UN and other world
  forums.

  Precisely.   Humanitarian concerns were not the primary justification

  the Kuwaitis didn't have oil (and assuming Iraq still saw fit to 
  invade them) I doubt you would have seen Operation Desert Storm.

   Sumgait Emergency Hospital

   Resident at Building 16/13, Apartment 14
   Block 5
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


To this day I can't understand why my husband, an older man, was killed. What 
was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't 
have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from 
the government--why my husband was killed.

On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.
He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, ""Mamma, is 
there a soccer game?"" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we 
lived. I say, ""I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV."" He looked 
again and said, ""Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!"" I look and see so 
many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, 
you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, ""Down with the 
Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" My God, why is 
that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together
well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely 
unexpected. And they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" And they had flags,
and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's 
around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I 
can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,
and the children behind him are shouting, ""Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" and 
""Down with the Armenians!"" They shout it again, and then shout, ""Hurrah!"" The 
people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I 
saw that there were women, too. I say, ""My God, there are women there too!"" 
And my son says, ""Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women."" Well we 
didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I 
simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani 
neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, ""Khalida, what's going on, what 
happened?"" She says, ""Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what 
happened."" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, 
each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their 
heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white
stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I 
don't know.

My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, ""Oh 
dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet."" And he says, ""What are 
you afraid of, they're just children."" I say, ""Everything that happens comes 
from children."" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and 
Vocational School. ""Don't fear,"" he said, ""it's nothing, nothing all that 
bad."" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they
broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. 
When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and 
there and I said, ""They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to 
kill us."" And he says, ""Don't be afraid."" Then we heard--from the central 
square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting
different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, ""You speak
Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying."" He says ""Close the window
and go to bed, there s nothing happening there."" He listened a bit and then 
closed the window and went to bed, and told us, ""Come on, go to sleep, it's
nothing."" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window
until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was
affecting him. I say, ""Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute
too."" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. 
Things had calmed down slightly.

The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, ""Come on, Emma, 
get up."" I say, ""Today's my day off, let me rest."" He says, ""Aren't you going 
to make me some tea?"" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, ""Where are 
you going?"" He says, ""I'm going out, I have to."" I say, ""Can you really go 
outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to
me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take 
the car out of the garage, go without the car."" And he says, ""Come on, close 
the door!"" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it
out, he probably said ""coward"" or something.

I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up
around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-
noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,
""Khalida, was it our car?"" She says, ""No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they
were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,
it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I
said, ""Oh, they've killed Shagen!""

Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm 
standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, 
they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten 
o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten
o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,
and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. 
I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I 
don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see 
it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. ""Mamma,"" he says,
""look what they're doing over there!"" They were burning everything, and there 
were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing 
on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are 
throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony 
is shouting, ""What are you standing there for, burn it!"" When they threw the 
television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out 
on her balcony and shouted, ""Why are you doing that, why are you burning those
things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their 
home. Why are you burning them?"" And from the courtyard they yell at her, ""Go 
inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in 
your building or not?"" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, 
they said, ""of them."" She says, ""No, no, no, none!"" Then she ran downstairs to
our place, and says, ""Emma, Emma, you have to leave!"" I say, ""They've killed
Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without 
Shagen. Let them kill us, too!"" She insists, saying, ""Emma, get out of here, 
go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my 
daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone."" I gave her the key 
and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, ""Igor, you stay 
here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.""

Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and 
Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in 
the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, 
and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived
in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw
an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, ""Madar, 
Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the 
garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. ""He shouts, ""Aunt 
Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for 
him."" I say, ""Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, 
I'm coming too."" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, ""You stay 
here with us, I'm go look."" He went and looked, and came back and said, ""Aunt 
Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. ""Madar went off again and 
then returned and said, ""Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's 
there . . . wheezing.""

Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, ""Don't go near him, 
or we'll put you next to him."" He got scared--he's young--and came back and 
said, ""I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take 
Alik, maybe he'll live . . . "" They grew up together in our courtyard, they 
knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but
not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and 
called, and called, and called--nothing.

I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, ""Two police cars drove up over 
there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still 
lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . ""We watched out the
window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't
take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six
o'clock in the morning I got up and said, ""Igor, you stay here at home, don't
go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or
alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.""

At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another 
doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, ""Doctor, is 
Shagen there?"" He says, ""What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!"" I 
wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,
they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They
said, ""Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.""

It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck
with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with
them. I say, ""Sara Baji [""Sister"" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've
probably brought Shagen."" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back
and says, ""No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person."" Now Shagen 
just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they 
said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, ""Doctor, they've 
brought Shagen in dead."" He says, ""Why are you carrying on like that, dead, 
dead . . . he's alive."" But then he went all the same, and when he came back 
the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They
knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, ""Doctor, 
is it Shagen?"" He says, ""No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely."" 
I say, ""Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, 
if not today, then tomorrow."" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the
office. He says, ""Emma, go, go calm down a little."" Another one of our 
colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous 
condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes 
later another colleague comes in and says, ""Oh, poor Emma!"" When she said it 
like that there was no hope left.

   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured 
people.

At night someone took me home. I said, ""Igor, Papa's been killed.""

On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: 
I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is 
surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. ""Hey, citizen, where 
are you going?"" I say, ""I work here,"" and from inside someone shouts, ""Yes, 
yes, that's our cook, let her in."" I went right to the head doctor's office
and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to
work with us at the hospital. He says, ""Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.
In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku."" I
say, ""Doctor, how will I bury him?"" He says, ""We're taking care of all that,
don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you
spend the night?"" I say, ""I was at home."" He says, ""What do you mean you
were at home?! You were at home alone?"" I say, ""No, Igor was there too."" He
says, ""You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just
one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right
now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here
like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...""
His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli
Sadukhov.

The ""ambulance"" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a 
patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the 
hospital until the 4th.

Some police car came and they said, ""Emma, let's go."" And the women, our 
colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, ""Where are 
you taking her?"" I say, ""They're going to kill me, too . . . "" And the
investigator says, ""Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive
identification."" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I
still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, ""Let's 
go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen."" And when I saw the caskets,
lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, ""I can't look, no.""
The investigator says, ""Are there any identifying marks?"" I say, ""Let me see
the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them."" He says, 
""Isn't they're anything on his body?"" I say he has seven gold teeth and his 
finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had
been injured at work . . .

They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they 
brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, ""Oh, 
they burned him!"" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat 
down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, ""Well fine, fine, since 
we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since
he has seven gold teeth . . . ""

On the 4th they told me: ""Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now."" I cried, ""How, 
how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform 
his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself."" They say, ""OK, 
you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they 
get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.""

He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in 
Sumgait. They asked me, ""Where do you want to bury him?"" I said, ""I want to 
bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,"" I'm 
shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, ""Do you know what 
it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!"" I say, ""What do you mean, 
arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that
they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone 
anymore."" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He
says, ""Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, 
if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . ""

Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the
investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then
at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. 
Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, 
""Ismailov, look, is that you?"" He says, ""Yes."" ""Well look, here you're 
describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?"" He says, 
""Yes."" ""And now you're telling it differently?"" He says, ""Well maybe I 
forgot!"" Like that.

The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going
along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a 
Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were 
involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear
who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side
of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports 
jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, ""What's your nationality?"" He 
says, ""Armenian."" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, ""If he's an
Armenian, kill him, kill him!"" They started beating him, they broke seven of
his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too 
. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he 
had an armature shaft. He says, ""I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, 
that's where I got it."" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he
had already had it. He said, ""I hit him twice,"" he said, "" . . . once or twice
on the head with that rod."" And he said that when he started to beat him 
Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, 
""I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,
killing someone,"" he says, ""and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or
not?"" I said, ""You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you
came back to hit him again?"" He went back and looked and he was already dead.
""After that,"" that bastard Tale said, ""after that I went home.""

I said, ""You . . . you . . . little snake,"" I said, ""Are you a thief and a 
murderer?"" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They
were taken. He says he didn't take them

When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was
other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned
it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, ""How can you 
have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?"" He said something, but
I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, ""You still haven't straightened 
everything out, I think that's unjust.""

When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. 
In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80
percent of his body . . .

And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good 
craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his 
own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the 
time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the 
Army. And now they're fatherless...

I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15
years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't
know what to do with myself, I said, ""How can that be? You,"" I said, ""you are 
saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' 
deprivation of freedom?"" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, ""Let me at that
creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . "" A relative restrained me, and there
were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,"" This isn't a 
Soviet trial, this is unjust!"" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .

I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, 
they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" and ""Glory to Turkey!"" And during the 
trial I said to that Ismailov, ""What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?"" I 
still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet 
Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still
don't understand why ""Glory to Turkey!"" I asked that question twice and got no
answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Assumption: When one major newspaper prints three or more articles on the front

to be considered an open story, and not a coverup.

First of all I never said the Holocaust. I said before the
Holocaust. I'm not ignorant of the Holocaust and know more
about Nazi Germany than most people (maybe including you). 
	What I resent is ignorant statements that call people
names when they disagree with your position. Opposing the
atrocities commited by the Israeli governement hardly qualifies
as anti-semitism. If you think name calling is a valid form of
argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more
often.
	I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII
justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government. Any
attempt to call Civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is
not appreciated.

What the hell do you know about Israeli policy?  What gives you the fiat
to look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation'
been published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs,
specifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My
brain is full of shit?  At least I don't look into the minds of others and 
make Israeli policy for them!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We all suffer.  It's too bad that civilians get killed but
I will blame their Arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before I
will blame the Israelis.  Just like Palestinians who send their children into
warzones to throw rocks at armed Israeli soldiers.  What irresponsible parents!
As Golda Meir said, peace will only come when the Arabs start loving their
children more than they hate the Jews.

[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?

Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was 
quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi 
revisionists say!

[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in
[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)
[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.
[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were 
[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy 
[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not 
[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.

OK.

[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my
[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these 
[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe 
[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,
[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...

There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the
Armenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-
Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever 
killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of
Anatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-
Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after
the Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the
extermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died
in this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of
preparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish 
genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers
away!

[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people
[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',
[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed
[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these 
[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. 

I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.

[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,
[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.
[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some
[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.
[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish
[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with
[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately
[SY] very easy to start a fire!

Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to
do with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that
the Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through 
Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians 
militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of
Caucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement 
caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years 
earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> 
Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> 
Massachusetts. 

[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience
[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were
[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to
[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves
[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.

My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste
potato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian
young man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,
local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive 
today.

[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.
[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But
[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why 
[SY] should they become enemies?

The theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal/Nazi 
Armenians of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle. 
Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.

What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been
efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a
one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,
the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took
the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty
and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian
activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of
terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element
of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass
rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,
when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis
defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.
Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they
were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their
country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked
in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum
in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on
the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]

For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander
of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: 

 ""They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down 
  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a 
  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word."" 

As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:

""Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
 with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken
 in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army
 withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian
 massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked
 in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places
 selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs
 were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
 being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part 
 of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
 cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
 from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
 in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
 Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not
 exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in
 Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything
 that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them
 in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting
 on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages
 left behind after their occupation of this area.""[2]
 
Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers
who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the
genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.
What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the 
massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]

At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague
Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,
Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the
cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,
but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]

I have found Jewish people very imagentative and creative. Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and
Islam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.
It is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. 
I thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe
on the same God, ""the God of Ebrahim"" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?
How are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them 
would distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same
God, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?


Man kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.
A religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.
The praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes
that God will help him when he prays.
Religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the 
religious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to
make their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his
cut too! 

Is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other
helps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts 
that we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will
see the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop
another religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would
to come its senses, before it is too late?


P.S. on the side

Do you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created
the earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God
you have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created
God through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?

Profit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught
him about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?
Makeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad
wanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? 

I think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.
Look at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will
have the same ending!!!!!!!!

Religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than
plotting each others distruction.  There is one earth, One life and one God. Let's all man kind be good toward
each other.

God help us all.
Peace

Maybe I'm a bit old-fashioned, but have you heard about something
called Love? It used to play some role in people's considerations
for getting married. Of course I know some people who married 
fictitiously in order to get a green card, but making a common
child for 18,000$? The power of AA is limited. Your proposal is
indeed unconventional.

Sorry, ARF - you dog,

That news was suppressed because the Israeli national volleyball team
repeatedly spiked it.

Let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts.
(Brits lead the way in this regard, with ~220 casualties in the last 2
years.)

Anyway, Yigal would never sue.  His life is (presumably) so pristine
that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to
anyone.  Might even be good instruction for some people I can think of.

Me, I _would_ sue!  I hate the way sports dominates the media.

Let us not forget the Nazi Armenians. Nazi Armenians were of service 
to Germans in Arab countries as well. As Uzun put it, one well-known 
case which received a lot of media-coverage involved two Nazi Armenian 
agents which were dropped over Syria by Italian war planes. The mission 
of the agents was to mingle among the Armenian population in Syria and 
to acquire relevant information for the German Wehrmacht on the allied 
forces in the area.[1] Nazi Armenians also helped German propaganda 
efforts in Arab countries designed to promote pro-Nazi sentiments among 
the French- and British-ruled Arab populations. Beirut had traditionally
been strong-hold of the Nazi Armenians and until very recently it was
the center of international Armenian terrorism. 

In Russia General Dro (the Butcher), the architect of the Turkish
genocide in WWI, was working closely with the German Secret 
Service. He entered the war zone with his own men and acquired
important intelligence about the Soviets. His experience with
the Turkish genocide in x-Soviet Armenia made him an invaluable 
source for the Germans.[2]

This clearly is a ""fantastic"" story, Anas!  I am very curious as to who
(or what) your sources are for this grossly exaggerated account (if not,
blatant lie).  It surprises me that this ""story"" has not yet made it to
the front pages of the major newspapers (which love to make the State of

by some of the papers over here.  So please explain to me why I have never

we both know where the story came from... YOUR DREAMS!!!!

 there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the Balkans than
 ordering American fighters to bomb the Serbs, but a frustrated senator
 told him to do just that.
 	``We've not done a damn thing,'' Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., told
 Christopher at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
 ``Preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in Bosnia-

 what he characterized as a limp response to the Serbian policy of 
 ``ethnic cleansing'' of Muslims, including rape and shelling of
 civilians.

 that all the options are bad ones,'' Biden said. ``They are all bad ones

 former Yugoslavia so the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government might have
 a chance to at least defend itself against the Serbs.

Now that they made sure the Bosnian (who were the only real subject of the

I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any
case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against
the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that
was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their
standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to
things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and
license information, photographs, etc.

> 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?

You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess
is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as
agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.
At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to
Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt
to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters
will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law
entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my
previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation
even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further
dissemination of certain types of private information about them.

Well, I would go as far as saying that Naturei Karta are definitely
Jewish fundamentalists.  Other ultra-orthodox Jewish groups might very
well be, though I am hesitant of making such a broad generalization.

Syria had been bombing Israeli settlements from the Golan and sending
terrorist squads into Israel for years.  Do you need me to provide specifics?
I can.

Why don't you give it up, Hasan?  I'm really starting to get tired of your 
empty lies.  You can defend your position and ideology with documented facts
and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  Take an example from
someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and
documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting
baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't
prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just 
prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.

All my love,
Ed.

Dear friends,

I am a graduate student in Education at the University of Tennessee. As part of
the requirements for a research class in music education I designed a
questionnaire to colect data for my research project. The study intends to
determine which techniques (if any) have been used to teach music for the deaf.

If you have any experience in music education for the deaf and would like to
help me with this project, your help would be very much appreciated. 

If you also want to exchange some ideas about the subject matter, feel yourself
welcome. I have been working in this area for a while (in Brazil _ by the way,
I am Brazilian _ and also in US) and I am very pleased with the results.

I hope that this inquiry will not cause too many inconveniences. Thank you for
or time and consideration.

In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi
concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first
Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion 
had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of Dro 
(the butcher) who is the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 
million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council 
was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was 
recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily 
formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the 
principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the 
Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination 
of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

  Zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the Armenians should not 
  be left in independent command of the Moslem population, as, their 
  troops being without discipline and not under effective control, 
  atrocities were constantly being committed, for which we should

Still in the threatening stage.. Maybe when there is no more Bosnians,

Anas, of course ! The YAHUD needed blood for the matza. After all, Passover
*was* last month :-)

Why don't you give us your National Geographic travelogue of your recent trip
to ""Palestine"" ? Or are you too disappointed by what you saw ? :-)

What proof. You said above: ""was it not reported..."" and ""someone please give 
full details if they can remember"". Hear say is not proof.

Yes, like the 700 or more Palestinians brutally murdered by their brothers.

DEPOSITION OF KARINE (KARINA) GRIGOREVNA M. [1]

Born 1964
Secretary-Typist
Azsantekmontazh Trust
Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration
Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization

Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15
Microdistrict No. 3
Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,
at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards 
away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, ""The Abyss."" 
Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at 
the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation 
whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it 
was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if 
someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There 
were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that 
large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the
film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well 
mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an 
Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that 
they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do 
to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded 
a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move 
over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone 
recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. 
It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's
only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. 
Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, 
people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the 
auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and 
gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, ""OK, we've 
scared them enough, let's leave."" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to 
me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of 
""anasha"", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like 
they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing 
had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful 
films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We 
could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, 
and it was dark . . .

Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin
Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, 
something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially 
listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to 
make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation 
wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, 
policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors 
there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-
stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some 
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, 
since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super 
serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we 
live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was
dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the 
driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and 
he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, 
OK . . .

So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was 
happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation 
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ""Ka-ra-bagh,"" they're not going 
to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's
immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had 
come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to 
cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,
just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma 
down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though 
nothing had happened.

That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and 
didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.
That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't
guess.

On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always
had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, 
Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and 
no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that 
morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at
home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda 
Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did
our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something
awful was happening in town. I asked, ""Don't they want Armenians? Well what 
are they after, if they're already in that state?"" She says, no, nothing like 
that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels
like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The 
cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.

Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy 
problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,
asked him, ""Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?"" Papa didn't know what she
was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home 
and told Mamma. Mamma said, ""Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on."" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,
she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I 
tell Lyuda, ""Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see 
you out."" Mamma says, ""You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can 
see what the situation in town is."" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was 
ready. Mamma says, ""Let her eat with us, then she can go."" We sat down at the 
table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything 
out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.
We turned on the television, and the show ""In Fairy-Tale Land"" was coming on. 
We cleared the table.

We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't 
see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people 
. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking
somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's 
an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down
to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story 
buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 
people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see 
several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide
that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not 
killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of 
the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their 
feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in 
general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak
. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .
If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he
got up and left or not.

I become terrified and go home and say, ""Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our
place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . "" Then the crowd 
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and 
starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors 
are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is 
shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it 
turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and 
kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop 
them.

They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,
afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the 
windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, 
and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't 
crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge
cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey 
Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear 
tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous 
din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were 
shouting Father's name, ""Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,"" or
something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma 
says, ""Into the bedroom, quickly!"" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part 
of our dowry; Mamma says, ""Hide there, they probably won't come in there, 
they'll ask something, say something, and leave."" She says, ""We'll tell them 
that we live alone here."" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in 
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say 
that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I 
can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak 
Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and
Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told 
her anything or not.

Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,
leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I
tell them, ""What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what
has happened."" In Azerbaijani, they say, ""Get out of the apartment, leave."" I 
say, ""OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the 
apartment."" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the
doorway, the young guys, say, ""There are old people and one girl with them.
Too bad!"" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have
pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, 
commanding them: ""Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?""

And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one
room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start 
undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, 
in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how 
much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,
and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The 
atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among 
themselves who would go first.

Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes
in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. 
He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It 
seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything
depends on him. He looks and says, ""Well, we're done here."" They are beating
Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs 
. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was
out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the 
window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the 
windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking 
about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong 
person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that
I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, 
which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they 
don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I 
humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my
tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing 
. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.

I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't 
know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by 
my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, 
something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone
else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death 
come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near
the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What 
happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.
 
I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me 
clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember 
that I said the same words over and over again: ""Mamma, what happened, Mamma, 
what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?"" I can't make 
sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he
served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all 
went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his 
courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though 
he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he 
served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served
there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor 
brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, 
""Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them."" How do I know who's who 
and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then
Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when 
they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda 
said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the
Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going 
to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's 
hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our 
sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding 
on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in 
there. So they survived.

My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.
While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back 
up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed 
there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put 
it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the
one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and 
knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, ""I'm not going to let you 
in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings 
and we'll leave the building."" Lyuda says, ""I'll stay at your place because of
what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs."" It was just for a 
moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came 
back to our place and lay under the bed . . .

I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone 
number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he 
came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were 
simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.
There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, 
it was hard to breathe . . .

My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our 
administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary 
passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right 
after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a 
great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and
what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not 
only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, 
without stopping. After us.

I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from
Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died
from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young 
Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building. 
Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives
to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in 
Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, ""Run
quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay
alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away."" At that moment 
three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such
awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, 
there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything 
out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face
was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my
normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to 
scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you 
here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of 
the soldiers said, ""Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the 
Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan."" So at that point the 
Daghestan police were there.

When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,
there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously 
injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they 
were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda 
and me and said, ""These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't 
know what to do with the rest.""

So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My 
boss said, ""Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter
what happens."" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department
head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She 
examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait 
ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People 
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.

That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, 
""God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?"" She looks me over and 
says, ""Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been
doing, your people did even worse things."" And I think, great, I have to deal 
with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this 
condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't 
have the energy to say, ""How could our people possibly be smart enough to 
think of something that yours haven't already done?"" I stayed there. Then they
brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her 
own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next 
morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This
was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything 
more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, 
nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at 
them.

I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-
pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face
was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, ""Better to ask 
your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can 
better explain what happened."" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw 
themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward.

Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me 
clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, 
but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up 
above my knees, and the woman orderly said, ""I can't believe you put on such a
short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?"" I went back to my 
ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and 
brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I 
couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said
that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one 
had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . 
Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should 
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an 
Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must 
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something 
else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on
the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.

The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, 
and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to
the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.
I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many 
troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw 
a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought 
that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait 
after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't 
come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. 
I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm 
me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw 
a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each 
other and asking, ""What happened, what went on?"" Two days later they came to 
see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed 
interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they 
could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues 
who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, 
neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what 
happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart 
. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, 
not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part 
of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by
myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my
lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I 
lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be 
from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.
When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of 
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. 
There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took 
me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were 
emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's 
friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. 
They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I
needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty
breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.
They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some
people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I
wasn't cut.

They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon 
appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not 
talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, ""We 
demand that Seidov come!"" The response was, ""It's Seidov who sent us."" Seidov 
is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, 
""We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same 
things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you 
agitators."" And so on. More of them said, ""Have Seidov himself come."" This 
went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us 
out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because 
they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The 
smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who 
had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a 
club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay 
to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day 
someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.
Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie 
theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it 
was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants 
took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in 
Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to 
mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting 
right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only 
the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women 
were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come 
any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered 
together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie 
theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to 
the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and 
couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently 
they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the
theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my 
eyes.

Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, ""Aren't you an 
Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani."" They
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did
not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in 
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like
they should have, with their IDs.

So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On
Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't 
spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,
they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered 
the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-
in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only 
the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, 
she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the 
building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. 
This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were 
already in the city.

They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire 
families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians
or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't 
see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult 
now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify 
the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard 
that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, 
including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in
Microdistrict 3.

They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who 
had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were 
going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply 
savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did 
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that 
hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians
out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from 
the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the 
ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira
G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and 
she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and 
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that 
whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and 
carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.

I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of 
people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a 
song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has 
that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, 
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They 
couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and
called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,
she couldn't remember anyone's face.

I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had 
talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw
the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She
goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at
the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the 
Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met 
with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint 
meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from
Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of 
those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.

They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the
Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-
tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They
showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our
case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were
the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were 
dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch 
me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these 
people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were
all from Kafan.

The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was 
there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't 
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since
I told him, ""Listen, you do something, because you know me."" He turned away 
and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina 
anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out 
anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became 
myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people 
there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his 
name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one 
we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, ""If
he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his 
alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not 
responsible for my words."" He said, ""What did they do to you, how awful, 
myself, I hid an Armenian family."" Then after some time goes by he comes back 
again and says something entirely different: ""I wasn't at home, my family and 
I went to Baku."" I said, ""Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally
different before."" After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is 
being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me 
that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. 
What are they doing with Rzayev?
Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the 
head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an 
insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the 
same time

I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-
ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one
wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what
exactly I can't say.                                                     

When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it, 
because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got
it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it 
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my 
face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, 
they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he
works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, 
is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ 
dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even
have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our 
building was killed, it was that man.

A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come 
over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was 
all over, people started making announcements in town saying that 
investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now 
they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been
beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he 
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy 
came to the plant and said, ""Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the 
bus station on Saturday at ten."" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,
went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday
night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do 
you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, 
probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't
say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, 
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had 
killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of 
that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that 
the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from

I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with
them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word 
I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an 
Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know. 
His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from 
Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. 
His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani 
KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many 
photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at 
curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, 
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a 
haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he 
is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did, 
I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. 
At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this, 
all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look
at him and thought, ""My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like 
you."" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything 
without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when 
she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over
the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the
balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had 
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. 
They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that 
moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the 
faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the 
apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and 
no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have 
anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the 
apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the 
apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they 
know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that
Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the 
building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis 
lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our 
apartment.

I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt 
when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would
have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but
probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at
a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were
being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have
been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from 
our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, ""Karina, we 
saw all of it, how could it happen?"" They're asking me! Well I just don't know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to 
me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been 
able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani 
woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated 
woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two 
Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She 
came down to the entryway and said, ""You'll come in this entryway over my dead
body."" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some 
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't 
even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well
what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They 
couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani 
stopped them.

They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place 
they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the 
apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? 
Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is 
some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed 
to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had 
come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They
didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They 
screamed and screamed: ""Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"" 
Only they didn't shout ""kill,"" they shouted ""gurun ermianlary."" Gurun 
literally means ""kill,"" or ""destroy.""

That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an
Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their 
kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part 
of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find
Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,
but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the
courage to . . .

A boy said to my mother ""Where's the gold?"" Mamma said he must have been 12 
to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the 
Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the 
fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where 
the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a 
little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to 
wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were 
bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma
thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and 
Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, 
bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had 
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and 
tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having 
trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and 
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted 
to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by 
accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, 
""What's happened?"" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, ""At least go and 
find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or 
murdered them, at least bring the corpses."" He went looking for us. At that 
moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that 
someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out 
from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought 
she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to 
herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from 
under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost
her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that 
way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled 
down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from
outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it
happened in.

And Mamma said, ""Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting 
something or other, and running toward the other building."" It had more or 
less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I 
tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, ""Listen;
let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how 
long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything."" I don't get it, all
women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe 
not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, ""Mamma, what do you need any of that 
for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!"" She
says, ""No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the 
night at someone else's."" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son
Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were 
coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He 
shouts, ""Come back, they're coming!"" They didn't have enough time to get a 
lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my 
knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,
out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his 
wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to 
leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, 
they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, 
maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over
there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished 
building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more 
or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.

Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom
apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,
Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that
time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and
her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started
pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, 
something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even 
live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and 
mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. 
They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, ""My 
God, what is going on around here? When will this end?"" We turned off the 
lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who 
knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but 
they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that 
he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his 
apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up 
at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.
They tell him, ""Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of
us."" He went upstairs, and they say, ""Aren't you taking anything from this 
apartment?"" He says, ""I don't need anything."" And the women who were standing 
in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were 
standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the 
first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time 
to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty 
pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really 
mad, and he says, ""Where's the rug? I just put it right here!"" They tell him, 
""Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school."" He ran off in that
direction.

Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, 
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They 
just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, 
she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told 
me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, 
the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, ""Where's the girl who was here?""
And he became furious. The woman tells him, ""She came to . . . "" She didn't
know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, ""She
came to and went to the basement."" Now, our basement is full of water. So the 
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took 
flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been 
standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there 
to get me. Then one of them said, ""There's so much water down there, she 
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in 
the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!"" I didn't know that, and 
when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't 
just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .

After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really 
didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and 
started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. 
Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people 
who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think 
that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but 
they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole 
brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been
enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?"" That's 
all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not 
one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were 
standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are
you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women 
that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for 
one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, 
an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: 
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed 
to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they
stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, ""If
you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment."" So she left.
That trick didn't work on them.

Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget 
that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it
had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, 
then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. 
And no one did anything. Anything.

BM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,
BM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
BM] is a part of it.  

Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged 
training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.
	
henrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 
henrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the 
henrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
henrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. 

BM]  Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
BM]  within their borders?  

	Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into 
        the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.

henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the 
henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER 
henrik] OCCUR again.

BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?

   It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped
   into Armenia if SHE could.
 
BM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
BM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  

	Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many
        cases, HISTORY repeats itself. 

BM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes 
BM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
BM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians 
BM] are attacking Azeri towns.

	So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey
        wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!

	I will believe it when I see it.

	Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing
        to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?
	Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the
	BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean
	BURNING people ALIVE !

BM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
BM] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
BM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
BM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  

	Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are 
        NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 
	from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. 

BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent 
BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better 
BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?

	Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the
	conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in
	KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.

BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
BM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of 
BM] their blood and future. 

	Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension
        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH
        are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.

BM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
BM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians
BM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate

 Well, if you put things into historical perspective, the Turks
 moved into an area, which was inhabited by Greeks.  This is how the history
 between the two nations started some centuries ago.  Since then, it has been
 a continuous battle between the two nations.  From my perspective I can't see
 why I should say that Greeks have been responsible for what has happened 
 between the two nations.  Of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that
 the hostility should drag till we kick the Turks out of this area.  This isn't
 going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
 countries.  A golden oportunity exists with Cyprus.  If things can't work
 there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.

 I thought it was a smart move to receive more money from Greek tourists.
 I bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from Greece
 in Turkey.  Each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this
 means to your economy.  If you had kept the visa requirement, how many
 Greeks would bother to visit Turkey?

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of
2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But 
most people aren't aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern
his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish
people in 1914.


     'After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?'
      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), 
          ""The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi"", p. 213.)


I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history's forgotten people. It does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping 
out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive 
ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and 
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We 
cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to 
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because 
of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims 
of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, 
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

Final Solution for the Gaza ghetto ?
------------------------------------

While Israeli Jews fete the uprising of the Warsaw ghetto, they
repress by violent means the uprising of the Gaza ghetto and
attempt to starve the Gazans.

The Gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.
The Israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
Gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in Israel.

While Polish non-Jews risked their lives to save Jews from the
Ghetto, no Israeli Jew is known to have risked his life to help
the Gazan resistance. The only help given to Gazans by Israeli
Jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.

The right of the Gazan population to resist occupation is
recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
justice. A population denied basic human rights is entitled to
rise up against its tormentors.

As is known, the Israeli regime is considering Gazans unworthy of
Israeli citizenship and equal rights in Israel, although they are
considered worthy to do the dirty work in Israeli hotels, shops
and fields. Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in
Israel. They may not live there, for these areas are reserved for
the Master Race.

The Nazi regime accorded to the residents of the Warsaw ghetto the
right to self- administration.  They selected Jews to pacify the
occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. Some
Jewish collaborators were killed. Israel also wishes to rule over
Gaza through Arab collaborators.

As Israel denies Gazans the only two options which are compatible
with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming
Israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
self-determination, it must be concluded that the Israeli Jewish
society does not consider Gazans full human beings. This attitude
is consistent with the attitude of the Nazis towards Jews. The
current policies by the Israeli government of cutting off Gaza are
consistent with the wish publicly expressed by Prime Mininister
Yitzhak Rabin that 'Gaza sink into the sea'. One is led to ask
oneself whether Israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
goals towards the Gazans ? Whether they have some Final Solution
up their sleeve ?

I urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
they can to help the Gazans regain their full human, civil and
political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.

The American people didn't have any problem with it too (Clinton). Actually I
think that it does not make any difference as long as they have the

Well, you should have noted that I was cheering an attack on an Israeli 
patrol INSIDE Lebanese territory while I was condemning the ""retaliatory""
shelling of Lebanese villages by Israeli and Israeli-backed forces. My ""team"",
you see, was ""playing fair"" while the opposing team was rearranging the
faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak. 

I think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
in Lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. There are no a priori
black and white hats but one sure wonders how the IDF can bombard villages in 
retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in Lebanon and then call the
Lebanese terrorists.

When the PLO moved into Lebanon and became, in parts of Lebanon, an
Occupying Power itself, these same practices were common against
non-Palestinean and Palestinean alike.  They are simply Standard
Operating Procedures among Palestineans and have been for a very long
time.  In fact, the greatest bloodbath of Palestineans will happen
when they get self-rule.  Can you possibly deny this? 

When the PLO is the Occupier, who are you NOW going to blame?

If you consider Israeli reporting of events in Israel to be propoganda, then 
consider the Washington Post's handling of American events to be propoganda
too.  What makes the Israeli press inherently biased in your opinion?  I
wouldn't compare it to Nazi propoganda either.  Unless you want to provide

It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I think
that our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the 
Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we 
should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even 
worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence 
zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army di
minished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'd
wonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the 
city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right.
As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault. You did not come to Anatolia just to enforce Sevres but to take part in the plunder  as well.

Not this time, Enis. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped 
with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who 
determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, 
ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. In 
other words, what we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people.

Not so fast! You have a rather warped sense of logic! You are telling us that
because Israel wishes to have good relations with Turkey even at the expense
of Armenians or Armenia, makes it bad for Turks to tell racist jokes against 
Jews. Thus, we can infer, if Israel had poor relations with Turkey, it would
be alright to post such horrible jokes against Jews!

Since one is also unlikely to get ""the truth"" from either Arab or 
Palestinian news outlets, where do we go to ""understand"", to learn? 
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another? The only way 
to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's ""political

While one may question the motives of the Arabs who sold land to Jews,

When the Jews were powerless, they did what they could to help others,

were on the forefront of the civil-rights movement.  The Jewish
government of Israel rescued Jews ranging in skin color from White
Russian to Brown Yemenite to Black Ethiopian.  Please, Andi, tell us

It's hard to beat a car-bomb with a suicidal driver in getting

Had Israeli methods been anything like this, then Iraq wouldn've been

the tens of thousands.  The fact is, though, that Israeli methods
aren't even 1/10,000th as evil as those which are common and everyday
in Arab states.

(aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT) is not really a Turk at all,
but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the

impossible, thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud

1. There is a similar idea here in ex-USSR about how many militioners it needs
   to place a new electric lamp. The answer is nine: one stays on a table and
   holds the lamp, four hold the table and turn it and yet four run around the
   table in opposite direction not to make the first feel bad (when being
   turned). Pitily, it lacks this kind of dark humour as Nick's msg does.

Freedom of speech does not mean that others are compelled to give one
the means to speak publicly.  Some systems have regulations
prohibiting the dissemination of racist and bigoted messages from
accounts they issue.

Apparently, that's not the case with virginia.edu, since you are still

There are many neutral human rights organizations which always report
on the situation in the O.T.  But, as most people used to see on TV, the
Israelis do not allow them to go deep there in the O.T.  The Israelis 
used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.  
So, this is another kind of terrorism committed by the Jews in Palestine.
They do not allow fair and neutral coverage of the situation in Palestine.

Aside from spelling , why is that you TURKS DO NOT want to admit your

bad that U.N. DID NOT do anything about it. You may ask : mistake ?
Yes, I would say. Why is that the GREEKS DID NOT INVADE CYPRUS ?

My response to the ""shooting down"" of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian
air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your 
Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the
KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived
in their HOMELAND for 3000 years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS 
BY STALIN) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending 
themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT 
people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and othe Russian aircraft. 

At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH 
crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.

Yup.  IRI also granted a great deal of reconstruction of houses and

Avi,
   For your information, Islam permits freedom of religion - there is
no compulsion in religion.  Does Judaism permit freedom of religion
(i.e. are non-Jews recognized in Judaism).  Just wondering.

RTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION

    By Adrian Croft
     SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, Reuter - Nineteen people, including the son of
former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League
(ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential
official information about them.
     Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art
dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants
in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.
     The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting
anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
them, including data from state and federal agencies.
     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the
governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ""a massive
spying operation.""
     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000
anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.
     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available
for comment on Wednesday.
     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed
confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.
     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and
Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,
which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.
It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other
unspecified damages.
     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the
plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his
wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.
     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the
University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
Minister.
     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.
     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both
kept information on thousands of California political activists.
     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.
     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and
Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.

APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit

Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

By CATALINA ORTIZ
 Associated Press Writer
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the
Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by
illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.
   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to
use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to
the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.
   ""None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate
crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None
of us is violent or criminal in any way,"" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education
consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.
   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister
Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of
Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably
because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
   ""The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks
politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,"" Arens said.
   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit
because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York
headquarters.
   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that
the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including
white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco
public television station KQED.
   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government
records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.
No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.
   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which
forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information ""not otherwise
public"" from state or federal records.
   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to ""persons and
entities"" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.
   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San
Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL
informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.
Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed
information on to Bullock.
   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.
Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit
because he had not yet studied it.





UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents

   SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday
charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy
by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.
   The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADL
and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information
on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and
South Africa's apartheid policy.
   The ADL refused to comment on the suit.
   The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San
Francicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees
in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.
   According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential
files in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these files
were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.
   ""The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on
political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is
absolutely repugnant,"" said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing the
plaintiffs.
   The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when
the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the
group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more
than 30 years.
   ""My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is in
some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility
to investigate,"" said Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern
California.
   ""The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politically
against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite.""
   The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the
operation for four months.
   The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former Israeli
Defense Minister Moshe Arens.
   In a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them
psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with
their freedom of speech.

Well, your Armenian grandparents were fascist. As early as 1934, K. S. 
Papazian asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians

        'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]

At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would
actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World
War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of Turkish
population of eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the Second World War.

In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'Hairenik Weekly:' 

""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall 
 see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations
 and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
 the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are
 strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
 On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is
 bereft of social sanctities.""[2]

DEPOSITION OF LYUDMILA GRIGOREVNA M.

   Born 1959
   Teacher
   Sumgait Secondary School No. 10
   Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10
   Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office

   Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15
   Microdistrict No. 3
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]

[Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in 
 Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights
 organizations - DD]

I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the
price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide
our lives into ""before"" and ''after."" We talk like that: that was before the
war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,
it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even 
sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now
. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened.

Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and 
those who didn't.

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you 
could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was
near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as
my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. 
My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought
that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.

In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the
afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel
like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a 
hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends
of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.

My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my 
mother, ""Run to the kitchen for a knife."" But Mother was detached, pale, as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never 
expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A 
girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, 
""No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out 
of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.""

We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from
excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their 
eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst
in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They 
came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other 
room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said, ""Tell them not to touch the children. 
Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children."" She
said this to Father in Armenian.

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They 
understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian, 
they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: ""You and 
your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, 
our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,"" and 
so on and so forth, ""and we came to do the same thing to you."" This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They 
were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people 
among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, 
all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm 
a teacher.

So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took 
him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,
because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were 
doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off 
Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: ""I'm old enough to 
be your mother! What are you doing?!"" He struck her. Now he's being held, 
Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina, 
who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their 
consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they 
mustn't do it. She said, ""Come on, let's straighten this out, without 
emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we 
ever do to you?"" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and 
coming--said, ""What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We 
came here to kill them.""

They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she 
didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, ""What
did we do to you? What did we do to you?"" And even later, when she came to, 
she said, ""Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?""

That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they 
were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they
did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, 
they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but 
didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, 
kicking her, using anything they could find.

Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain, 
just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they 
did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the
apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, ""Let's take her 
outside.""

Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they 
weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't 
afraid of what would happen to them.

When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered 
with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several 
times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm 
vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them, 
and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me 
""forget,"" you have to forget, you have to go on living.

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and 
despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had
to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that
he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over
me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up
with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I 
suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly 
I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the 
ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,
they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with
their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-
cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.

I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. 
Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't 
need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had 
even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth 
living.

There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman 
pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, 
because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, 
one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, 
even during the investigation he almost called me ""daughter,"" he apologized, 
although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that 
I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my 
words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,
but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never 
forget it.

I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one 
could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.

And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to 
kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it 
was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a 
little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,
how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said, 
""You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,
I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,"" he
says, ""nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again."" The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He 
saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the 
brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to 
do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even 
remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry ""Marina!"" out to her, but could
not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus
I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell 
right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . 
although her spirit was murdered . . .

At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that 
mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his 
name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, ""Igor,
help!"" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the 
neighbors.

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, 
something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.
 
Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone 
said, ""She's already dead, let's throw her out."" When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani: ""Don't kill her, I know her, she's a 
teacher."" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember
whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my 
eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had 
been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately 
I can't remember anything more.

What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot 
about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too
much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,
if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that 
all out later.

Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is 
Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she 
didn't want to endanger him. She said, ""He was there,"" and a little while 
later, ""Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. 
No, it seems like it was he."" I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something 
entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought 
groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started 
crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting 
us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait. 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the 
investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.

Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her 
wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's 
lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A 
Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a 
special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that
boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine, 
and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too. 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.

He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, ""Lady, if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment we'll let you live."" And Mamma told them where 
the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one 
another right then.

Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was
black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she 
ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-
low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead, 
halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see, 
and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, 
it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.

The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,
a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people 
were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, 
everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, ""I was afraid 
to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the 
threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'."" Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, 
out of one eye. She says, ""I realized that my death would come from that 
person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.""
Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.

I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina 
was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all
alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.
I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones 
I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the 
ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me.

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I 
didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, ""Neighbor, is that
you?"" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived
I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been 
taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in 
the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the 
presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities 
or not. He said, ""Enough, let's go to the third entryway."" In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as 
they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they 
found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had 
already taken the other.

Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They
had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I 
identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an 
Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:
""Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.""
That's just what he said, ""those Azerbaijanis,"" as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, ""I'll drive
them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41."" 
That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened 
to, the ""general,"" said that they were going to the third entryway.

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself. 
Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I
was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.

I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find 
anything. He told me, ""Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the 
neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're 
alive."" He told me all this in Armenian.

Then he returned to the others and said, ""What are you waiting for? Leave!"" 
They said, ""Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself. No, we want to do it to."" He urged them on, but gently, not 
coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just
boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went
down to the third floor with them himself, and said, ""Leave. What's the mat-
ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?"" And
he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I 
told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really
good terms with them.

We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said, ""I'm an Azerbaijani."" He said, ""I know. 
Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows
about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place."" She says, ""Fine,
have her come in."" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into 
tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a 
half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, ""Do you know where my family 
is, what happened to them?"" She says, ""No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid 
to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see 
who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian."" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says, ""You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, 
or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else."" During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl
earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was 
still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I 
touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it
to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.

I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I 
don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. 
I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. 
Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were
broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay 
there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were 
burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport 
jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the
one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. 
And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to 
strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on 
my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got 
burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was
protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know 
how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if 
I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I 
had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I 
thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. 
I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in 
Afghanistan, he should protect her.

While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I
thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would 
she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among 
themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no
children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. 
Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was 
all over. They started to argue. A third one says, ""How come you get it? I 
have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. 
All these years I've been living in God-awful places."" Another one says, 
""Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave."" Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their
place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and
left.

Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently, ""Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians."" Then they 
said, ""Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!"" They repeated it 
very often.

I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held 
to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living 
in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious 
persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied 
to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human 
rights abuse widespread in Greece.

""Greece's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks""

...Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority
community in Dedeagac province, had, he said, been destroyed
by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4.

Sungar added that they had received harsh treatment by the
security forces during the demolition.

""This is not the first demolition in Dedeagac province; more
than 40 houses were destroyed there between 1979-1984 and 
members of that minority community were made homeless,"" he
continued. 

""Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies""

While World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks 
Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity
of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.

In his 65-page confession, Salman Demirok, a former chief of PKK
operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between
PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed.

According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only 
gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with 
food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory. 
Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus, 
used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added, 
terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's 
and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from 
the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the 
extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so 
that they can travel from one region to another without being 
confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed 
by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to 
police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained
that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus, 
sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

Case 2: Horst Bosniatzki, a West German Citizen.

...At midnight he was taken to the beach, chains were put to his 
feet and he was threatened to be thrown to the sea. He was dragged
along the beach for about a 1.5 Km while being punched on the 
head and kidneys...Back on the police station, he was beaten
on the finger tips with a thin stick until one of the fingertips
split open....

              ""Abu Nidal's Advisers"" Reportedly Training
                  ""PKK & ASALA Militants"" in Cyprus

       Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,
       Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant
       information in connection  with the camps set  up in the
       Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of
       militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for
       the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close
       to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian
       militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos
       mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated
       that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military
       training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.
       They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for
       Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing
       their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the
       clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist
       groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations
       moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they
       would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a
       number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos
       mountains.

       Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,
       which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in
       Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs
       of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material
       support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader
       of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,
       George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men
       not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out
       by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as ""extreme
       racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.""  Reliable
       sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent
       operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that
       organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in
       extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he
       instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the
       PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established
       that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his
       camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking
       were exposed.

                    Special to The New York Times

ATHENS, June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and 
Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that 
Athens, for several months, conducted negotiations with the
terrorist known as Abu Nidal...

They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard
intelligence reports.

Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah 
Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport 
bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan 
Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.

In Washington, State Department officials said that when
Administration officials learned about the contacts, the
State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The
officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings
with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried
out terrorist acts against Turks....

I took your advice and ordered a copy of the Washinton Report.  I
heartily recommend it to all pro-Israel types for the following 
reasons:

1.  It is an excellent absorber of excrement.  I use it to line
    the bottom of my parakeet's  cage.  A negative side effect is
    that my bird now has a somewhat warped view of the mideast.

2.  It makes a great April Fool's joke, i.e., give it to someone
    who knows nothing about the middle east and then say ""April
    Fools"".

Anyway, I plan to call them up every month just to keep getting
those free sample magazines (you know how cheap we Jews are).

BTW, when you call them, tell 'em barf sent you.

Just Kidding,

Ben.

I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these 
*indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these ""guerillas"" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the

I agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these
attacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept its
situation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to control
this ""third party state"" within Lebanese territory and the attacks kept
occuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to do
something ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?

It is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outside
party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angola
had the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolan
guerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africa
refused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,
would Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying that
Angola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?

I refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel from
Lebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. 

One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its 
border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS 
CHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the 
Lebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it 
EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That
**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*
have been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions.

I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be ""used"" by EITHER side,
and have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is that
if a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, it
should expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that ""other"" will be
the UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak.

Not so unconventional.  Eugenic solutions to the Jewish Problem

This is nothing more than Feisal Husseini's statement that the
Zionist entity must be disolved by forcing it to ""engage"" the

""a strong mixed stock"", ""integration of Israeli society into

A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which

I lived there until July 1992 so I think that on the whole,
my input is relevant.

Those are two separate questions.  Obviously, Israeli authorities do
recognize Israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports,
consular services, etc...  ID cards have a field of nationality
which is a subdivision of the above.  Ostensibly, this field
is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments
of the gov't, though this is not the general case.

|> 2.      Is it true that the State of Israel has no fixed borders

From its onset, Israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both
war and peace.  As such, the Israeli gov't has always felt that defining
its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have
been conluded with its neighbors.  There is no plan for ""ultimate borders""
(is this a game like ""ultimate frisbee""?) extending into  other countries.

|> 3.      Is it true that Israeli stocks nuclear weapons ? If so,

Aside from what Vaanunu provided, no.

If that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is
unanswerable.  Anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.
That having been said, I deny the above.

You go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious
bias.  Questions of the sort ""Is it true that you entered your
mother's vagina?"" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though
phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions
upon Israel.  Incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes,
unless you were born via a C-section.

Let me clearify Mr. Turkish;

ARMENIA is NOT getting ""itchy"". SHE is simply LETTING the WORLD KNOW that SHE
WILL NO  LONGER sit there QUIET and LET TURKS get away with their FAMOUS

Never. I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an 
index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned 
and advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitude 
of the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alien
population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total
population and they did it only within a time period of a little over
two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.

Now I would like to ask you:

  Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to 
  this one?

And again I would like to ask you:

  Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands
  of Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a ""Final
  Solution"" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or not
  to the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution to
  Jewish problems?

The latest Israeli ""proposal"", first proposed in February of 1992, contains 
the following assumptions concerning the nature of any ""interim status"" 
refering to the WB and Gaza, the Palestinians, implemented by negotiations.
It states that:    
   >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until ""final status""
    is agreed upon;
   >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the 
    Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA);
   >The ISGA will apply to the ""Palestinian inhabitants of the territories""
    under Israeli military administration. The arrangements will not have a 
    territorial application, nor will they apply to the Israeli population 
    of the territories or to the Palestinian inhabitants of Jerusalem;
   >Residual powers not delegated under the ISGA will be reserved by Israel;
   >Israelis will continue to live and settle in the territoriesd;
   >Israel alone will have responsibility for security in all its aspects-
    external, internal- and for the maintenance of public order;
   >The organs of the ISGA will be of an administrative-functional nature;
   >The exercise of powers under the ISGA will be subject to cooperation and 
    coordination with Israel. 
   >Israel will negotiate delegation of powers and responsibilities in the 
    areas of administration, justice, personnel, agriculture, education,
    business, tourism, labor and social welfare, local police,
    local transportation and communications, municipal affairs and religious
    affairs.

Several question do come to mind concerning the ""success"" we all hope for 
in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to 
be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian ""interim"" self-control. 
Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible 
vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the 
negotiating process) more ""relaxed"" proposals for this""interim"" period? 
How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their 
""maximalist"" approaches as stated above? How can Israeli worries ,and 
desire for some ""interim control"", be addressed while providing for a  
very *real* interim Palestinian self-governing entity?

Like it or not, Edward, Anwar has a very good, valid point.  Obviously,
in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point
of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but
that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a ""slippery slope"" type of
argument, which I believe was his aim.

I very frankly believe that the ADL will be proved innocent in this
case.  I doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a
civil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond
any reasonable doubt, is the standard for ""winning"" such a case.  That,
however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in Anwar's point.

enter the war with israel till the 4th day .

By the way it is funny that you are implying that the reason behind 1967

This a ""tried and true"" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:
to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the
opposing ""state"" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,
in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the
people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the
innocent civilians into harm's way.

Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel
should totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking
another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
innocent lives?

Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of ""demilitarized"" or ""buffer""
zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
of Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly
surprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to 
do it themselves.

>If Israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from OUR land.  

What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states 
can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will
only occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the 
responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their 
soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some ""guaratees""), there is no way
Israel is going to accept their ""word""- not with their past attitude of 
tolerance towards ""anti-Israel guerillas in-residence"".

Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop
anything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows
them in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and
'67. Somehow, with that ""limitation"" on the troops ""powers"" I don't
think that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) ""guarantees"" by other parties, the UN is worthless
to Israel (but, perhaps useful as a ""ruse""?).

Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is
the feeling that it is better that ""many of us die fighting
against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently 
accept our fate."" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of 
suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,
Arab and Islamic groups.

From Israel's perspective, ""concessions"" gets it NOTHING...except the 
realization that it has given ""something"" up and now *can only 
hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken
back* by merely doing so; to ""take back"" tangible items (land,
control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should
stay away from.
 
Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades 
before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.
The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel 
would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state 
involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure 
in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts 
committed by ""private groups"", 3) Israel would prepare for the next 
round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and
don't be so idiotic as to suggest ""trust"" for the motivations of
present-day Arab states)?

>There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese

Ah, ok...what is ""different"" about the present situation that tells
us that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic 
policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague ""political factors""
but about those ""tangible"" (just like that which Israel gave up)
factors that ""guarantee"" the responsibility of those states. Your
assessment of ""difference"" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,
and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that
sort of thing.

It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,
Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.
Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain 
control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.

Your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and

Those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing
anyones' freedom of speech.  The neo-nazi movement has a right to
make speeches, say anything they want.  They do not have a right
to have these speeches published by the N.Y. Times.  That depends
on the Times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent
newsworthy value of those speeches.  Likewise to the sysadmin
of this fellows system.  If he feels his resources are being
used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are
perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as
the New York Times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas.
The poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's
pocket book when he posts.  He who controls the purse strings
has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds
spent or not spent.

Noone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local
building as a symbol of his hatred.  Freedom of Speech in no
way equates to accessibility to conduits of information.  The
market of ideas has its own ""natural selection"" process that
weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of
importance.

Smart indeed.  If what you're saying is true, Greeks who visit are happy,
the Turkish merchants are happy; who is harmed?  No one.  So not only was
it a smart move, it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
200.000 Greeks per week and however many Turkish merchants they interact with.
One simple move in the paperwork arena -> lotsa happy people of both 
nationalities.  Just and observation.

'SDPA.ORG' criminals/Nazis in action. Your fascist government got away with 
the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying 
the fruits of that genocide. And your criminal organization will not get away 
with the genocide's cover-up. In June 1915, a major uprising took place in 
Sebinkarahisar under the leadership of the famous Nazi Boyadjian. The Moslem 
districts were burnt down. Hundreds of soldiers and gendarmerie were killed
and hundreds of civilians also perished.

   Armenians first of all occupied the Talori region, which included 
   the villages of Siner, Simai, Gulli-Guzat, Ahi, Hedenk, Sinank,
   Ekind, Effard, Musson, Etek, Akcesser. Leaving their wives, 
   children and property in these inaccessible spots, the Armenians 
   joined forces with other armed bands coming from the Silvan 
   districts in the plain of Mus, after which the whole body of
   3000 men gathered in the Andok Mt. Five or six hundred wished
   to surround Mus, and started off by attacking the Delican tribe to
   the south of the city. They slaughtered a number of the tribe and
   seized their goods. The religious beliefs of the Muslims who fell
   into their hands were derided and disparaged, and the Muslims
   themselves murdered in the most frightful manner. The rebels
   also attacked the regular troops in the vicinity of Mus, but the
   large numbers of the regular forces prevented them from
   occupying the city.

   The rebels joined the bandits in the Andok Mts., carrying out
   the most frightful massacres and looting among the tribes of the
   neighbourhood. They burned Omer Agha's nephew alive. They
   raped a number of Turkish women at a spot three or four hours'
   distance from Gulli-Guzat and then strangled them.

   At the beginning of August the rebels attacked the Faninar,
   Bekiran and Badikan tribes, perpetrating equally horrible
   atrocities. The rebels in the villages of Yermut and Ealigernuk in
   the nahiye of Cinan in the kaza of Cal attacked the Kurds in the
   neighbourhood, as well as the villages of Kaisser and Catcat.

   Towards the end of August, the Armenians attacked the
   Kurds in the vicinity of Mus and burned down three or four
   villages, including Gulli-Guzat. As for the 3000 rebels in Talori,
   they continued to spread death and destruction among the
   Muslims and other Christian communities, refusing to lay down
   their arms.

They certainly are until the Arabs make peace.  Only the most leftist/Arabist
lunatics call upon Israel to withdraw now.  Most moderates realize that an 
Israeli withdrawl will be based on the Camp David/242/338/Madrid formulas
which make full peace a prerequisite to territorial concessions.

	  That's what i don't want, you couldn't imagine the result of a war.....
	  So France, Greece and  USA wants to start fighting with Azerbadjan???? 
	  They give a lot more weapons to the Armenians without

	  I must say that these Armenian Government is very shortsighted.
	  Do they think that they shall move from it's neigbours when the war

	  Look, The President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, died and  Petrosyan

As one who was born in Quebec and worked in Montreal, I feel I must
defend the reputation of McGill University. It is a fine, old,
creditable institution of higher learning.

Thus, I can only assume that some under graduate student left his/her
terminal on-line and the janitor has been getting access to it.

""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""

THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians
in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about
600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.

The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of
the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first
suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.
Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
dead.

The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali
Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman
Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in
the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman
of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.

FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International
Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the
bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr
Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.""

Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will
take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old
lawyer said at his small office.

Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to
reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
uprising in Baku in January 1990.

Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power
three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70
miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.

Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage
of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the
chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.""

Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland
snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's
report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.

Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The
most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a
helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27
February.

""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr
Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
pilot.

""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and
one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but
Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
return.""

There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali
at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by Armenian forces.

THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92


HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.

""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""
the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to
be alive.""

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh.

""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy
machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.

To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.

""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
67-year-old elder brother.

""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""
he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We
have never got any of the bodies back.""

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing, Mr Sadikov said.

Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy
hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee.

""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.
They even found a bullet in my sock.""

has been  complicated because Muslims  bury their dead  within 24
hours.

There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Begin

The word ""troops"" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence
that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village
apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the
Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of
casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran
into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group 
of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.
Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the
major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.

Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there is
serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than
to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares
wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of
wounded Arabs.  Guess why.

As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truck
got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a

It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that the

Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.

I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants that
totally destroys Begin's whitewash.  I have no particular desire

Well, Panos, Mr. Tamamidis?, the way you put it it is only the Turks
who bear the responsibility of the things happening today. That is hard to
believe for somebody trying to be objective.
When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannot
blame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.
What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway?
Do you think it was your right to be there?
I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.
It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.
I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better.

The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educated
people. They have never met me but they know! I am bad person
because I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it is
not the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individuals 
why the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind of
brainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated person 
treat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about your 
history books and things you learn about Greek-Turkish
encounters during your schooling. 
take it easy!

Dorin, of all the criticism of my post expressed on t.p.m., this one I accept.
I regret that aspect of my post. It is my hope that the occupation will end (and
the accompanying loss of life) but I believe that stiff resistance can help to 
achieve that end. Despite what some have said on t.p.m., I think that there is 
a point when losses are unacceptable. The strategy drove U.S. troops out of 
Lebanon, at least.

I know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about
sense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of 
certain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even 
today, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should 
be called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half 
a millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'

Everyone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'
but Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name 
of Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's
Peking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo
of the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's
old colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes
have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.

But, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul 
by the name of 'Cons*.'

How can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks
so different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable
democracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,
for instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in
1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New 
World, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence
in 1776 will come 284 years later.

Shouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for 
'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the 
Greek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the 
laurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, 
any more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil 
of Anatolia.

These undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It 
is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize
that Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows
that it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,
stock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.

In fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following
bloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the
island of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:

The Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,
the Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as 
their territory. But, it has never been the possession
of the government of Greece - not even for one day -
in the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is
located 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only 
40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.

Saddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi
territory and the Greek Cypriot government and 
the terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus
also was once part of the Greek hegemony.

Those 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination
should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront 
reality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only 
facts count.

As for Selanik,

  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the
  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to
  the great port of Izmir.

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912
  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,
  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>

  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a
  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where
  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.
  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as
  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more
  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-
  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire.>>

Arab leaders are now following by Islamic rules?  (Or is it only applicable
in cases like this?)  :-

I remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife,
Saddam also has a mistress.  Assad's brother has a wife and *several*
mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the Gulf have, within their lifetimes,
wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).
 
This is all irrelevant.  It takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these
leaders ruthless and corrupt.  Maybe Netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse'
himself by making such a public confession.  Does the average secular Israeli
care, though?  The Mossad probably applauded him.  :-)

Living through those days at the age of 20 and following
the internal and external news gives me that knowledge
and position.  In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free
press at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't
heard anything from any international source about any
concentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey.
However, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well 
recognized POW camp.

I see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have
decided to acknowledge their existence first but later
changed their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do
you think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject 
of Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.

You don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state
in its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN 
since the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of
Turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short 
lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the 
internal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it
before wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions 
against Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after
the 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say?
I am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had
their own share too.

Have you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks
mediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any
missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?
I heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and
International press.  He keeps saying that ""This was no
longer an issue for peace talks.""  Also, you don't want
me fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic
had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as 
a Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions 
among Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish 
custody.

I am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was
given to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish
Goverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some
of their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in
late August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international 
community, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it
an issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN
condemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?  

BTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta
and nobody got hurt in those events?

Like I said before.  There is even a different opinion among
Greek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who
governed the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes
to cover up their tracks 8-).  I hope Turkish Army does't have

                  THOSE INTREPID ISRAELI SOLDIERS
  
 
 Israeli soldiers have sexually taunted Arab women in the occupied Gaza Strip 
 during the three-week-long closure that has sealed Palestinians off from the 
 Jewish state, Palestinian sources said on Sunday.
 
 The incidents occurred in the town of Khan Younis and involved soldiers of
 the Golani Brigade who have been at the centre of house-to-house raids for
 Palestinian activists during the closure, which was imposed on the strip and
 occupied West Bank.
 
 Five days ago girls at the Al-Khansaa secondary said a group of naked
 soldiers taunted them, yelling: ``Come and kiss me.'' When the girls fled, 
 the soldiers threw empty bottles at them.
     
 On Saturday, a group of soldiers opened their shirts and pulled down their
 pants when they saw girls from Al-Khansaa walking home from school. Parents 
 are considering keeping their daughters home from the all-girls school.
     
 The same day, soldiers harassed two passing schoolgirls after a youth
 escaped from them at a boys' secondary school. Deputy Principal Srur 
 Abu-Jamea said they shouted abusive language at the girls, backed them 
 against a wall, and put their arms around them.
 
 When teacher Hamdan Abu-Hajras intervened the soldiers kicked him and beat
 him with the butts of their rifles.
 
 On Tuesday, troops stopped a car driven by Abdel Azzim Qdieh, a practising
 Moslem, and demanded he kiss his female passenger. Qdieh refused, the 
 soldiers hit him and the 18-year-old passenger kissed him to stop the 
 beating.
 
 On Friday, soldiers entered the home of Zamno Abu-Ealyan, 60, blindfolded
 him and his wife, put a music tape on a recorder and demanded they dance. As
 the elderly couple danced, the soldiers slipped away. The coupled continued
 dancing until their grandson came in and asked what was happening.
 
     The army said it was checking the reports.

      ISRAELI TROOPS BAR CHRISTIANS FROM JERUSALEM
 
 Israeli troops prevented Christian Arabs from entering Jerusalem on Thursday 
 to celebrate the traditional mass of the Last Supper.
     
 Two Arab priests from the Greek Orthodox church led some 30 worshippers in
 prayer at a checkpoint separating the occupied West Bank from Jerusalem after
 soldiers told them only people with army-issued permits could enter.
 
     ``Right now, our brothers are celebrating mass in the Church of the Holy
 Sepulchre and we were hoping to be able to join them in prayer,'' said Father
 George Makhlouf of the Ramallah Parish.
 
     Israel sealed off the occupied lands two weeks ago after a spate of
 Palestinian attacks against Jews. The closure cut off Arabs in the West Bank
 and Gaza Strip from Jerusalem, their economic, spiritual and cultural centre.
 
    Father Nicola Akel said Christians did not want to suffer the humiliation
 of requesting permits to reach holy sites.
 
     Makhlouf said the closure was discriminatory, allowing Jews free movement
 to take part in recent Passover celebrations while restricting Christian
 celebrations.
 
     ``Yesterday, we saw the Jews celebrate Passover without any interruption.
 But we cannot reach our holiest sites,'' he said.
 
     An Israeli officer interrupted Makhlouf's speech, demanding to see his
 identity card before ordering the crowd to leave.

Subject: NAZI methods in Gaza

Title: In the neighborhood of Hope, among the rubble

(Excerpts)

Mahmoud Jowara'r stared at me long and sadly: ""I worked my entire
life in order to built that house and this is what is left"". Only
TV could transmit the full sadness of his face. ""You say that we
teach our children to hate you, but what do you expect to happen
to a child who sees this ?"" And once again he wraps himself in a
lengthy silence, his face crumbling into weeping. Mahmoud stood in
the field of rubble that was once his home. The term
'dispossession' has an absolute meaning here. Nothing is left of
what he accumulated during his entire life, only the rubble of a
house and shreds of belongings.

Once again Khan Yunis. Once again demolished homes. Last Thursday
there was a search for wanted people here. Once again the IDF
forces employed the new method, fired and bombed and shot missiles
and placed explosives. Already three times during the past weeks I
have gone out to see the destruction and each time I was more
horrifying scenes. This time they hit the largest number of
houses, 17 according to the IDF estimate, ten of them completely
demolished. But not only that:  the method has also become more
brutal. Three weeks ago, in Tufah neighborhood in Gaza, the
residents were still told to remove their valuables from their
homes.  This time the army skipped that part; three weeks ago the
handcuffed men, inhabitants of the demolished homes, were supplied
with some water and one apple during the 12 hours they had to
stand. This time there was only water. Three weeks ago they were
even allowed to go out to the toilet. This time the soldier just
gold them: Piss and shit in your pants. And thus, last Thursday,
some 45 men stood for about 12 hours, their hands bound behind
their backs, their eyes blindfolded, without food, with wet pants
on their legs and a terrible feeling of humiliation in their
hearts, listening to the sounds of the explosions destroying their
homes, one after the other.

(...)

Dr. Juma'a Fuad Said al-Rubi. the brother from Saudi Arabia,
emerges from among the ruins. Ten days ago he arrived for a family
visit, mainly in order to celebrate the housewarming with his
father and brothers. On Thursday he was handcuffed like everyone
else for 12 hours, and later went with everyone to view the
destrucion. He tried to explain that he was a visitor and that he
is a physician, but only got a shove.  Like all the rest he also
urinated in his pants, while standing with his hands bound and his
eyes blindfolded for the entire day. Juma'a al-Rubi studied
medicine at Cairo University, and for ten years he has been
treating wealthy Saudis in Medina. His wife and four children
remained there. Now his documents have been lost and he does not
know how he will return to them. ""There is no humanity"", stated
the physician from Saudi Arabia.

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.
Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about
anti-trust in the business world.

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says
that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing, you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /
multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair
market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).

Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is
a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it
has an integer square root.

Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that

Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).
Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic
cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the
international community, or make the best out of a no win
condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So
yes, they're there. But as a community with history and
roots, its dead.

I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest
Palestine?

And the 'Turkish Karabag' is next. As for 'Cyprus', In 1974, Turkiye 
stepped into Cyprus to preserve the lives of the Turkish population 
there. This is nothing but a simple historical fact. Unfortunately, 
the intervention was too late at least for some of the victims. Mass 
graves containing numerous bodies of women and children already showed 
what fate had been planned for a peaceful minority.

The problems in Cyprus have their origin in decades of 
oppression of the Turkish population by the Greek Cypriot 
officials and their violation of the co-founder status of 
the Turks set out in the constitution. The coup d'etat 
engineered by Greece in 1974 to execute a final solution 
to the Turkish problem was the savage blow that invoked 
Turkiye's intervention. Turkiye intervened reluctantly and 
only as a last resort after exhausting all other avenues 
consulting with Britain and Greece as the other two signatories 
to the treaty to protect the integrity of Cyprus. There simply 
was not any expansionist motivation in the Turkish action at 
all. This is in dramatic contrast to the Greek motivation which 
was openly expansionist, stated as 'Enosis,' union with Greece. 
Since the creation of independent Cyprus in 1960, the Turkish 
population, although smaller, legally had status as the co-founder
of the republic with the Greek population.

The Greek Cypriots, with the support of 'Enosis'-minded
Greeks in the mainland, have consistently ignored that
status and portrayed the Island as a Greek island with
a minority population of Turks. The Turks of Cyprus are
not a minority in a Greek Republic and they found the
only way they could show that was to assert their 
autonomy in a separate republic.

Turkiye is not satisfied with the status quo. She would
rather not be involved with the island. But, given the
dismal record of brutal Greek oppression of the Turkish
population in Cyprus, she simply cannot leave the fate
of the island's Turks in the hands of the Greeks until
the Turkish side is satisfied with whatever accord
the two communities finally reach to guarantee that
history will not repeat itself to rob Turkish Cypriots
of their rights, liberties and their very lives.

Yes, Israel has nuclear weapons. However:

1) Their use so far has been restricted to killing deer, by LSD addicted
   ""Cherrie"" soldiers.

2) They are locked in the cellar of the ""Garinei Afula"" factory, and since
   the Gingi lost the key, no one can use them anymore.

3) Even if the Gingi finds the key, the chief Rabbis have a time lock

 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at 
 almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people 
 well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality
 problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the 
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. 
 I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is

 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent
reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye
biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe
chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian
genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian,
she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong
characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian
ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian
from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant
Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen
Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from
Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married
David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married
William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of
Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their
daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the
eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady
Diana. It is noteworthy  that Eliza Kewark was also
referred  to as  Mrs. Forbesian  (a characteristic
Armenian  surname  ending).  An  Armenian-Scottish
gene mix is dynamite.

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed.
Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly 
people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated 
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 
1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide 
that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought 
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian 
terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that 
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
today.

""In April 1915 Dashnaks from Russian Armenia organized a revolt in the city 
 of Van, whose 33,789 Armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
 closest to an Armenian majority of any city in the Empire...Leaving Erivan 
 on April 28, 1915, Armenian volunteers reached Van on May 14 and organized 
 and carried out a general slaughter of the local Muslim population during 
 the next two days while the small Ottoman garrison had to retreat to the
 southern side of the lake.""

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
 Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
 Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First
 World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
 to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other
 invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian
 success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of
 Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
 soldiers began deserting in droves.""

""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
 World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy
 increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
 Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn
 massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of
 expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""

I recently read that during Bill Clinton's campaign, he stated
that if elected he would immediately recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.  According to the article, Mr. Clinton
reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  However,
during recent talks with President Mubarak, Secretary of
State Christopher stated that ""the status of Jerusalem
will be a final matter of discussion between the parties"".

Now I don't want to start a big discussion over the status
of Jerusalem.  All I want to know is if anyone can 
authenticate Mr. Clinton's statements with dates, places, etc.

Thank you.

It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of
freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-
frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do 
occur. There are situations where a few extremely vocal, and 
usually radical, people **do** drive people away, effectively stifle
all other (""opposing"") views and generally ""take over"". *Clearly*,
the purpose behind such actions is *to deprive* others of *their*
freedom of speech through overt and covert coercion and domination of 
the ""media form"" in question. While ""freedom"" of speech is to be valued,  
this is not. How would you suggest that this sort of reoccuring problem be 
alleviated? More particularly, how can this be controlled within the 
structure of these newsgroups?

Subject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism


Zionism and the Holocaust
-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth

The first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history
of the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without
anti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet
of anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.

The history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While
the industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,
its roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish
aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles
in Europe. When the hopes for liberation through
bourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for
improving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.

The socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had
to contend with opposition from a new and small, almost
insignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these
two offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.
While the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of
Europe's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme
aimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a
Jewish state.

Historically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of
forces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option
tree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become
barred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point
before that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an
option was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority
position until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist
Federation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny
minority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to
represent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an
interantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was
the only international organisation allowed to operate during this
period. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist
Federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that
surprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political
power, power based not on representation, but from being selected
as the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish
problem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements
that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in
Germany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in
Germany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to
be considered by German Jews.

The best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.
Immediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the
world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German
goods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German
authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.
It was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull
out, the campaign would collapse.

This problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi
party as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement
that existed between the two organisations on the question of
race, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it
offered to collaborate with the new regime:

""The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of
Jews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -
such as is currently being carried out against Germany in many
ways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do
battle but to convince and build.""

In their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new
regime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.
The main public act was the signature of the ""Transfer Agreement""
with the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In
essence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of
the country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility
for Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the
country, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This
right was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The
Zionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial
organisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -
'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the
boycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,
and last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane
and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After
all, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the
Jews come and agree with them.

After news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the
Zionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with
the Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?
This was not the first time that the interests of both movements
were presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von
Mildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,
later followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.
This he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,
Kurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a
series of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new
Jew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.

This little-known episode established quite clearly the
relationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new
regime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a
number of key instances, even after the nature of the Final
Solution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of
reports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book
concentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the
Holocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the
Holocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.

In the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play
PERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of
the real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end
of the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and
the African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a
number of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A
second front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies
prepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,
the master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in
occupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in
April 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish
leadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by
Kastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their
relationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did
this is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its
three and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly
different from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian
Jews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class
was mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed
freedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in
fronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were
Hungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be
exterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in
Hungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other
countries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and
were unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.

Like elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the
ear of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this
case the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.
Without their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,
plus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and
controlled a million Jews, when they did not even know their
whereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.
Eichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's
committee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to
Auschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them
clearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain
conditions were met.

The Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary
about their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,
being in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the
Nazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not
have been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite
plausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.
Thus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their
death, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to
work camps.

To be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of
destruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to
Kastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it
was a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid
for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million
Jews.

There was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be
located, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of
Kastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews
here and there, but the scale of the operation would have been
miniscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.

It is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,
like say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his
strongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical
outcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to
the Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi
and Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to
disrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,
did Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those
Jews.

To conclude, the role played by Zionists in this period, was
connected to another role they could, and should have played, that
of alarming the whole world to what was happening in Europe. They
had the information, but politically it was contrary to their
priorities. The priorities were, and still are, quite simple: All
that furthers the Zionist enterprise in Palestine is followed,
whatever the price. The lives of individuals, Jews and non-Jews,
are secondary. If this process requires dealing with fascists,
Nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world, so
be it.

This could be accomplished by other criteria.  One must remember
that children often bring stress into households. As an alternative,
one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed
by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds.  The plan could
be entitled ""PEACE INCOME SEXUAL SECURITY"", or PISS for short.

Every time an Israeli gets screwed
by a Palestinian or visa versa, they would be eligible for income.
In keeping with the spirit of the times, condoms would be a tax deductible
expense.  This policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor
would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality.

Joint Palestinan-Israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all
acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. The teams of Palestinian-Israel
Morals Patrols, or PIMPS, would receive a percentage of the financial
income in order to encourage their participation and add to their
incentive in locating suitable candidates.

And anyone who doesn't agree with you is, by your own definitions, a

It is nonsense, Danny, if you can refute it with proof. If you are citing your

The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.
I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historical
one.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feeling
is that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine or
Israel, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.
With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rights
in Israel as do all other Israelis.

Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think
you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their
supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my
knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,
as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens
of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli
citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find
themselves.

Armenia is involved in fighting with Azarbaijan.  It is Armenian
soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.
You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression
only in that region.  It seems to me that the Armenians are better
organized, have more success militarily and shell Azeri towns
repeatedly.  

I don't wish to get into the Cyprus discussion.  Turkey had the right to
intervene, and it did.  Perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
last for so long, but the constant refusal of the Greek governments both
on the island and in Greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
for the ongoing standoff in the region.  

Lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  I vote yes for it.
After all, it is now free.

    A laudable precaution.  
    
    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray

So, it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers
in your country.  (Of course, many of those attacking claim that they
aren't Lebanese, so it's not their country.)

Got it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.

Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is
permissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under
what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves.
Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for
terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians,
but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against
those missiles.

Thessaloniki is called Thessaloniki by its inhabitants for the last 2300 years.
The city was never called Solun by its inhabitants.
Instabul was called Konstantinoupolis from 320 AD until about the 1920s.
That's about 1600 years. There many people alive today who were born in a city
called Konstantinoupolis. How many people do you know that were born in a city 
called Solun.

	You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self
hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel,
using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?

	I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to
refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the
Nazis, do their dirty work for them.  We can just call them house
Jews, fools, or anti-Semites from Jewish families.

	I think ""house Jews,"" a reference to a person of Jewish
ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that
condemn Judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  I think a few years free of
their anti-Semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.

Dear folks,

I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.

It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normal
civlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967
without civil and political rights. 

It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza is
not a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreign
country for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestinians
are concerned and as far as common sense has it. 

It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizens
and the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionists
will begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the same
rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.

Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israel
is entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should be
entitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnel
to enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master
and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.

To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistence
and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a
crime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss 
to which Israeli society has degraded. 

I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
why Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to return
and live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?
Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their
religion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.

	The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak
	------------------------------------

		""On the ancient peak of Ararat
		The centuries have come like seconds
		And passed on.""
				-Avetik Issahakian

by Yuri Danilov

Some years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: ""What
books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?"" And 
though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, 
depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, 
and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, 
not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at
least one book of arithmetic problems.

Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they 
were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for ""numbers"" (though 
secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because 
they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern 
mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't 
know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were 
no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a 
specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: ""I willingly confess that 
any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was
a hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of 
my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route
--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid 
using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is 
well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, 
nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers
(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It 
seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade 
teachers.""

Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the 
bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to 
recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most 
fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a 
relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to
Venus and back.

	The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History 
	of Herodotus. ""Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,"" thought 
	the Royal Astronomer.
					--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud

The book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 
elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same
time, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these 
problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian 
architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is 
now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant 
letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of 
Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.

An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a 
bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions
of Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh 
Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).

The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way 
of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and 
worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years 
the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in 
Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let just
anyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk 
Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has 
brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the 
general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable 
problem book.

		Vardapet Anania of Shirak

	Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no 
	philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering 
	it the mother of all wisdom.
					--Anania of Shirak

Among ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because 
of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his 
work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and
Solutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation
of scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and
Armenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last
work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, 
Movses of Khoren).

In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:

	I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our
	Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, 
	in the expression of the psalmist, ""every day I illuminated the 
	eyes of my mind."" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,
	I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, 
	the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia 
	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the 
	sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man 
	named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me
	that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,
	Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But 
        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but 
        only of certain fragmentary facts.

	I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: 
	""Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the 
	coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full 
	of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature."" I asked 
	them how they knew this. They answered: ""We saw ourselves that many 
	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. 
	Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,
	Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become 
	pupils of Tyukhik."" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to 
	God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.

	I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I 
	had come. He received me graciously and said: ""I praise Our Lord that 
	He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. 
	Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself 
	lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there."" 
	Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with 
	me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated 
	the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students
	at the king's court began to envy me.

	I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not 
	been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable 
	collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, 
	books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why 
	enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did 
	not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating
	that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into 
	Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the 
	translation read as if the work were written in that language 
	originally.

	Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had 
	learned the Armenian language. ""When I was young,"" he said, ""I lived 
	in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and 
	for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I 
	served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and 
	literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was 
	wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to 
	the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: ""If You prolong my life, 
	I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to 
	collecting treasures of knowledge."" And the Lord heard my prayers. 
	After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria 
	and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher 
	from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned 
	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.""

	After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for 
	him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to 
	assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to 
	God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because
	of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study 
	with him.

	And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from 
	him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our 
	country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's 
	help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me 
	for my efforts.

				Problems and Solutions

	A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed
	on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; 
	one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and 
	forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many 
	copies were printed in all.
					--Imitation of Anania of Shirak

A Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (""books have their own fate"").
The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The
manuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to 
Armenian historians, ""in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded 
from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children."" Biding
their time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of 
ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).
And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two 
manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction 
and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, 
annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a 
member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).

In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are ""amusing, full of life, 
and simple."" Orbeli goes on to say: ""The subjects of the problems are 
generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland 
Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are 
named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a 
contemporary of Anania."" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used 
only ""aliquots"" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is
necessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to 
represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).

Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the 
retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their 
full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.

Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 
572.

Problem 1

My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the 
Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary 
heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. 
The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, 
pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third 
time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were 
still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from 
this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.

Problem 8

During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak
Kamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the
Persian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a 
day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent 
riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in 
a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.

Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian 
translation, they are all called ""dishes."" But in the original Armenian, 
according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are 
called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian 
word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before 
Anania's Problems and Solutions.

Problem 18

There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the 
metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from
one fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten 
drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.

Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in 
Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.

Problem 7

Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank 
of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. 
We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped
out of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found 
forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.

The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myself

Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that 
inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no
mention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according 
to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of 
Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .

Problem 20

The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, 
was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild
donkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, 
running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with
his brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild 
beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by 
arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were 
caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And 
so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.

	His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a 
	bibliography.
				-- K Uzbashyan, Academician
					Iosef Abgarovich Orbeli

Anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the 
solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation 
of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,
has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, 
and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great 
attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for 
a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma 
attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An 
advertisement at the end of the book reads: ""This book was typeset in 
December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by 
me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with 
borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project 
to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.""

Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned 
orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage 
Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had 
already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis 
Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its 
rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish 
the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian 
churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve 
the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.
Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the 
blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)

When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times 
were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania
was for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the 
printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the 
Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion
of Russian academic typography.

Let's imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing, and high 
schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts-in training in the Perelman 
crater on the far side of the Moon. Maybe one of the space travelers will take 
this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read 
this article and say to himself: ""This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty 
interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.""

Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by then
there will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And 
we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by 
Iosef Orbeli.

A unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.
---------------------------------------------------------- by
			  Elias Davidsson

The following proposal is based on the following assumptions:

1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to
education, to establish a family and have children, to human
dignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are
more important to human existence that the rights of states.

2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and
rights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.

3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as
Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an
unresolved conflict exists.

4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of
people. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples
and nations.

5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars
in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.

6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional
political means have failed.

7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two
distinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the
land, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.

8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake
of peace and justice. When people love, they share.

Having stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.

1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants
for each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew
and the other Palestinian-Arab.

2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove
that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli
citizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,
although born in areas under current Isreali control, is not
entitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.

3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For
the second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each
subsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.


4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which
have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the
Israeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and
Christian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of
governments and international organizations.

5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'
marriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on
'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its
ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a
truly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of
people would also help the integration of Israeli society into the
Middle-East in a graceful manner.

Objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will
attempt to identify some of these:

1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected
forms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,
it is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is
recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the
perverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International
law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at
reducing racial discrimination and segregation.

2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is
a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous
colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed
struggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the
'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but
Israeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be
defeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill
the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental
human rights over collective rights (see above)

3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of
financial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their
point of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People
overrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of
human rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar
Bronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he
gave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing
assimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its
effects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit
either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see
above)

4.      It may objected that only a few people in
Israel/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus
not serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that
although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect
of such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed
couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and
encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist
attitudes.

5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to
bring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has
merits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than
$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government
and by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the
Middle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would
suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable
climate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in
Israel/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a
non-segregated society in that worn-torn land.

I would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as
well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful
discussion and enrichment.

This is not small. A 2.7 per cent annual population growth rate implies
a doubling in 69/2.7 \approx 25 years. Can you imagine that? Most people
seem not able to, and that is why so many deny that this problem exists,
for me most especially in the industrialised countries (low growth rates,
but large environmental impact). Iran's high growth rate threatens things
like accelerated desertification due to intensive agriculture, deforestation,
and water table drop. Similar to what is going on in California (this year's
rain won't save you in Stanford!). This is probably more to blame than 
the current government's incompetence for dropping living standards
in Iran.

Ten Questions about arab countries
----------------------------------

I would be thankful if any of you who live in arab countries could
help to provide accurate answers to the following specific questions.
These are indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and
again by people around me.

1.      Is it true that many arab countries don't recognize
Israeli nationality ?  That people with Israeli stamps on their
passports can't enter arabic countries?

2.      Is it true that arabic countries such as Jordan and Syria
have undefined borders and that arab governments from 1948 until today
have refused to state where the ultimate borders of their states
should be?

3.      Is it true that arab countires refused to sign the Chemical
weapon convention treaty in Paris in 1993?

4.      Is it true that in arab prisons there are a number of
individuals which were tried in secret and for which their
identities, the date of their trial and their imprisonment are
state secrets ?

4a.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Syria, harbor Nazi
war criminals, and refuse to extradite them?

4b.	Is it true that some arab countries, like Saudi Arabia,
prohibit women from driving cars?

5.      Is it true that Jews who reside in the Muslim
countries are subject to different laws than Muslims?

6.      Is it true that arab countries confiscated the property of
entire Jewish communites forced to flee by anti-Jewish riots?

7.      Is it true that Israel's Prime Minister, Y. Rabin, signed
a chemical weapons treaty that no arab nation was willing to sign?

8.      Is it true that Syrian Jews are required to leave a $10,000
deposit before leaving the country, and are no longer allowed to
emmigrate, despite promises made by Hafez Assad to George Bush?

9.	 Is it true that Jews in Muslim lands are required to pay a
special tax, for being Jews?

10.     Is it true that Intercontinental Hotel in Jerusalem was built
on a Jewish cemetary, with roads being paved over grave sites, and
gravestones being used in Jordanian latrines?

11.	Is it really cheesy and inappropriate to post lists of biased
leading questions?

11a.	Is it less appropriate if information implied in Mr.
Davidsson's questions is highly misleading?

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, Master of Wsidom, 
							       ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. /sigh.

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE, 
   and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.

   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my
   point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.

If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

   |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?

Worthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.

   ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up. 
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?

   |> |> Anyway, as for Hamas, then obviously they turned to the islamic system.

   |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because
   any system can solve it. 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). 

I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that 
mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your 
reply.

   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
	   ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal
						^^^                  ^^^
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.
	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of
	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.""
				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967
				   (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)

Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
something back.


   ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). 

   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !

   I think that is fair enough .

No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land. 


   ""The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children"".
			   -Rabbi Shoham.

Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.

Bullshit.  You've been in Iceland for the past 30 years.  You told us

Let's say that Israel grants the PLO _EVERYTHING THEY EVER ASKED FOR_.
That Israel goes back to the 1967 borders.  What will the ""Palestinean
Arabs"" in Tel-Aviv call themselves?  The Palestineans in West
Jerusalem?  In Haifa?  Will they still claim to be ""occupied""?

Or do you suggest that Israel expell or kill off any remaining Arabs,
much as the Arabs did to their Jews?

Indeed, there is much which is not symmetrical about the conflict in
the M.E.  And most of this lack of symmetry does NOT favor Israel.

If you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon

But don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?
If Lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
of Israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
Hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  Afterall,
Israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas
it occupied in Lebanon during SLG.

True, but the Syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate
in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas
were attacking Israeli lines.

The problem is that Syria is also not as stable a partner for long term
peace as others in the area might be.

Elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. But it seems to be
almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb,
overstated image in order to add extra ""meaning"" to the posting's
*real point*. 

However, his second statement *is* quite real. The essential sealing off
of Gaza residents from the possibility of making a living *has happened*.
Certainly, the Israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took,
but isn't that action a little draconian?

They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'
is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during 
the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, 
assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people 
because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts 
of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, 
set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts 
behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly 
attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population 
indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent 
Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with 
axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt
alive as can be seen below.

Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions 
of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and 
Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,
also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from 
behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of 
Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed 
widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena
was left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from 
Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide 
by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, 
Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French 
journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century
committed by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.

The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, 
Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their 
villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.
The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for
humanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,
Austrian, French and American authorities.

Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and 
cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by 
Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish 
and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. 
Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of 
the victims of these cruelties can be heard.

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and

 have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I
 have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at 
 almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from
 Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly
 slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to
 save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful
 events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then
 taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people 
 well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these
 places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.
 They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the
 Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality
 problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers
 who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and
 Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the 
 Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. 
 I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is 
 destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are 
 speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as 
 well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is 
 proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

I thought the implication was that the prince destroyed one fourth of the

on the third round.  This would mean

Answer: a*(1 - 1/2)*(1 - 1/4)*(1 - 1/11) = 280  -->  a = 821.333

May I suggest you chech out the _Palestinian National Covenant (1964)_.  It may
not use the exact words as quoted above but I'm sure many will agree that the
same message is being issued.  Later on when I get back home I will try to find
the precise section(s) but you can do the research for now (I hope).  I also
realize that Yasser Arafat renounced the _Covenant_ *to the Western media only*
but he has yet to inform the PNC officially and enequivocally of his exact
intentions on this issue.  Therefore, as far as we are concerned the _Covenant_
still stands as the ""Bible"" (so to speak) of the mainstream Palestinian
National movement!


>(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
>since it was coined by Bnai Brith)

As a staunch pro-Israel activist I can confidently say that Bnai Brith has NOT
influenced my opinions on the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As I mentioned above,
just a little research on the subject will lead anyone to reach a similar
conclusion on the Palestinian National movement (the PLO in most cases).  BB
does not properly speak for me nor many of the people around me who share
my views.

What 1948 situation?  A negative situation I presume?  Is this the same
""situation"" when the Jordanian occupiers of East Jerusalem would not allow the
Jews to go worship at the HOLIEST SITE IN JUDIASM?  Was this an example of
Qu'ranic law being exercised?  If not, I have another suggested reading for
you... get into the ""soc.culture.arabic"" newsgroup where the posters have been
debating the topic ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" (and may I remind you the people doing
the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).
You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put
it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will
be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think
the 1948-1967 ""situation"" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you
think?

All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" and
think again.  ""Freedom of choice"" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic
law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure
you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic
state).

Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren

In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian
National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.  By the way, Redpath
Library DOES have it in stock because that is exactly where I found it when I
was doing my research.  So enjoy the reading and I hope we will be hearing back
from you soon!

 No. I do not thing we are doing them a favor.  I have simply stated that

 I fail to see how my words show discrimination. And what do you mean that
 they do not get nothing? Is, for example, helth insurance, food, and tuition

 What part exactly is this one? The people cannot even sell their property

 renovate some buildings for decades; it needed a special agreement between
 the two goverments for this. Talk about a part of the society? Why has the

Dear Mr. Davidsson,

   You claim that your purpose is to fight racism.  But you don't
seem to have any interest in injustice except that which may have
been committed by Israel.  The treatment of Jews in Arab nations,
an injustice of staggerring proportions, is an injustice that you
do not seem to care the least bit about.  Why not?

Absolutely. I'm sure that civilians on both sides would be pleased
if the fighters (military, guerilla, whatever) would just take their
argument elsewhere, find an unpopulated area somewhere, and slug it out.  
At that point, we will all breath a sigh of relief *and* cheer for
our side in the struggle.

I am not in the business of reading minds, however in this case it would not
be necessary.  Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across
as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.  

The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace
after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:

 1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently
    most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or
    dictators.

 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

Of course you never read Arab media,

I read Arab, ISRAELI (Jer. Post, and this network is more than enough)
and Western (American, French, and British) reports and I can say
that if we give Israel -10 and Arabs +10 on the bias scale (of course
you can switch the polarities) Israeli newspapers will get either
a -9 or -10, American leading  newspapers and TV news range from -6
to -10 (yes there are some that are more Israelis than Israelis)
The Montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer
to Kahane's views than some Israeli right wing newspapers, British
range from 0 (neutral) to -10, French (that Iknow of, of course) range
from +2 (Afro-french magazines) to -10, Arab official media range from
0 to -5 (Egyptian)  to +9 in SA. Why no +10? Because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against Israel and therefore against them since 
they are doing nothing.

the average bias of what you read would be probably around -9,
while that of the average American would be the same if they do
not read or read the new-york times and similar News-makers, and
-8 if they read some other RELATIVELY less biased newspapers.

so you are not better off.

Two Arabs Killed and Eight IDF Soldiers Wounded in West Bank Car
Bomb Explosion
 
Israel Defense Forces Radio, GALEI ZAHAL, reports today that a car
bomb explosion in the West Bank today killed two Palestinians and
wounded eight IDF soldiers. The blast is believed to be the work of
a suicide bomber. Radio reports said a car packed with butane gas
exploded between two parked buses, one belonging to the IDF and the
other civilian. Both busses went up in flames. The blast killed an
Arab man who worked at a nearby snack bar in the Mehola settlement.
An Israel Radio report stated that the other man who was killed may
have been the one who set off the bomb. According to officials at
the Haemek Hospital in Afula, the eight IDF soldiers injured in the
blast suffered light to moderate injuries.

No, he does not.  Arafat explicitly *denies* this claim.


from a Libyan televison interview with Yasser Arafat 7-19-1991
Q: Some people say that the Palestinian revolution has many times changed
   its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the
   Palestinian problem and on the Palestinian Liberation Front.  The
   [strategies and tactics] have not been clear.  The question is, is the
   direction of the Palestinian problem clear?  The Palestinian leadership
   has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this
   happened on the way to the dialogue with the United States, the PLO
   recognized something called ""Israel""...

A: No, no, no!  We do not recognize the State of Israel.  We said
   ""recognition"" -- when a Palestinian state is established.  It will then
   decide if to recognize Israel or not.  When it is established, its
   parliament will convene and decide.

>policies which it can justify through occupation.  Because of this,

	And replace them with what?  If Israel is to withdraw its
control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  One is that
it leads to a reduction in deaths.  The second is that it should not
weaken Israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.

	Leaving Gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages
arabs to think they can get what they want by killing Jews.  The only
way Israel should pull out of Gaza is at the end of negotiations.
These negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with
security guarantees for both sides.

	Until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again,
they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.

	First let me correct myself in that it was Goerbels and
not Goering (Airforce) who ran the Nazi propaganda machine. I
agree that Arab news sources are also inherently biased. But I
believe the statement I was reacting to was that since the
american accounts of events are not fully like the Israeli
accounts, the Americans are biased. I just thought that the
Israelis had more motivation for bias.
	The UN has tried many times to condemn Israel for its
gross violation of human rights. However the US has vetoed most
such attempts. It is interesting to note that the U.S. is often
the only country opposing such condemnation (well the U.S. and
Israel). It is also interesting to note that that means
other western countries realize these human rights violations.
So maybe there are human rights violations going on after all.

What else do you expect?  Israel is trying to portray itself
as the great democracy.  One requirement is to have a leader
who previously had an extra-marital affair (e.g. Bill Clinton)
It helps if your wife says it's OK.

FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS

Hadashot, 14 March 1993:

The Israeli Police Department announced on the evening of Friday,
March 12 that it is calling upon [Jewish] Israeli citizens with
gun permits to carry them at all times ""so as to contribute to
their security and that of their surroundings"".

Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993:

Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee,
stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
[non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.

Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:

Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern
Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza
strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
measures in the Strip.

The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents
as they leave for work in Israel. They can be used to reveal the
presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects.

In addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private
civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading
devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate
the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must
carry.

Are you one of those people who were born when Istanbul was called 
Konstantinopolis? I don't think so! If those people use it because
they are used to do so, then I understand. But open any map
today (except a few that try to be political) you will see that the name 
of the city is printed as Istanbul. So, don't try to give
any arguments to using Konstantinopolis except to cause some
flames, to make some political statement.

I wouldn't bet on it.

Arab governments generally don't care much about the Palestineans and
their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home.
They are happy to leave the Palestineans largely under Israeli control
because that leaves the job of controlling them to the Israelis.  The
Israelis don't like this job any more than King Hussein of Jordan
liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands
per month when they started an Intifada in Jordan.  The governments of
Syria, Lebanon and Egypt all feel similarly.  However, proclaiming
public support for the Palestinean war against Israel deflects
criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
even the most brutal Arab tyrants.

Arab *PEOPLE* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  Palestineans
have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in Jordan,
Lebanon and Kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.

You might still be right in sympathy to the war against Israel, but I
suspect that many Arabs, far removed from the immediate border with
Israel (e.g. in Kuwait or Morroco), couldn't care less.

The village I described was actually the closest I could come to
describing mine.  I agree there may be other villages where the civilian
population has deserted because it is too close to Israeli lines and
thus gets bombed more often.  In such villages often the only remaining 
inhabitants are guerillas and some elderly who have nowhere else to go.
But for the most part the typical South Lebanon village is more like
mine.  One where civilians and guerillas live together.  They are
often inhabiting the same house.  Many families are large, some
have members of the families involved in Hizollah, most others
are not.  That is what is so hard of South Lebanon, Israel is
not fighting an army with well drawn battle lines, but a guerilla
tyoe resistance which by definition and necessity blends with
the local populace.  Not because they are evil cowards that
use women and children as shields, but because that is the only
way one can fight a more powerful better equipped occupying army.

Hizbollah and Amal are now the main two militias.  Though
Hizbollah people tend to be more committed to resistrance
operation and better motivated by religious conviction.

  As to retaliation,

It may be a mixture of what we both say.  Sometimes Israel chooses
its targets carefully.  At other times it just sends its pilots on
sorties aimed at a town in general since it only knows that the 
attackers came from that specific village but has no further
intelligence.  On several occasions Israel retalliated against 
civilian refugee camps, even in North Lebanon, just to show
that it will not sit idly after its soldiers have been attacked.
Most of the time it directs the SLA to do the dirty work and
indiscriminately shell some Lebanese villages on the other side.
I have experienced this shelling myself on several occasions,
this is why the SLA militia is sometimes even more despised than 
Israeli troops.

I hope you are right on Israeli willingness to withdraw, but I still
contend that withdrawal would be the better course for Israel's

Hmm...  Here we disagree on what serves Syria interests better.
I think Syria wants to have Lebanon all to itself.  It would
be willing to guarantee Northern Israel's security in return for
Israeli withdrawal.  I don't think Syria wants Israel to be
involved in its protectorate of Lebanon.  Syria is sitting at the
negotiating table because it has come to accept that and wants
to get a political resolution.  A renewal of hostilities
along the Lebanese front could put the whole ME peace negotiations
back in question.

I agree that the loss of any human life is deplorable and regrettable.

Mark,
Were you one of the millions of Americans cheering the slaughter of Iraqi
civilians by US forces in 1991? Your comment could also apply to all of
them. (By the way, I do not applaud the killing of _any_ human being,
including prisoners sentenced to death by our illustrious justice department)

Peace.

What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim a
s well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza
k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
 way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref

Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of
independence.  He was killed by the Israelis.  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.

FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.

Paper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv's time). Friday local Tel Aviv's
paper, affiliated with Maariv.

Date: 19 February 1993

Journalist: Guy Ehrlich

Subject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan
(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate
within the occupied territories.

Excerpts from the article:

""A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as
Arabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most
important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is
that everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one
way or another insane"".

A man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name
is known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge
from the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be
called Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to
depart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different
from average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript
service. But in their souls, one can notice something completely
different....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures
about what happened to them. And they think that to most of their
fellows from the Cherry it woundn't be easy either. Yet after they
began to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.
The following article will contain all the horror stories
recounted with an appalling openness.

(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in
which some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We
called such soldiers H.I. 'Hit by the Intifada'. Under my command
was a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common
phenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I
should talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On
Fridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to
until I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The
keys of my father's car must be ready for in advance, so that I
can go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don't
want them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it
instantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time
and then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only
there I become normal.(...)

(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.
It was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to
me and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which
was still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how
exactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began
to laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh
straight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a
mincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov
cocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as
they deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with
the effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I
was delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the
Arab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit
him straight in his ass. We both felt that we'd pulled off
something.

Next I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts
in the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that
spot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,
blood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: 'Shut
up' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed
straight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at
something convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: 'All
right, wait a moment'. I left him in order to take a look at
another wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be
saved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the
help of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all
this to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight
into my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt
I was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he
omelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over
her head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn't know
what to say.

(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls
upon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a
field. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend
shot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the
hill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.
We enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two
deer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we
saw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to
such some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully
inspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of
the two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We
had hit'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,
so as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my
revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short
distance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the
bullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall
outside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of
blood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our
madness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like
beasts of prey. We couldn't explain what had happened to us. We
were almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we
felt the whole day very badly.

(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.
This is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may
be for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel
Godlike of sorts.""

(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment
studying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any
security-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. 'Why
shouldn't I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?
Why shouldn't I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver
while being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits
me perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a
reasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to
Bosnia in order to fight there.""

There have been a number of articles on the PBS frontline program
about Iranian bomb. Here is my $0.02 on this and related subjects.

One is curious to know the real reasons behind this and related
public relations campaign about Iran in recent months. These include:

1) Attempts to implicate Iran in the bombing of the New York Trade
   Center. Despite great efforts in this direction they have not
   succeeded in this. They, however, have indirectly created
   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist
   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.

2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and
   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and
   outlaw state.

3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I 
   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and
   perhaps intensify.

Why this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have
been behind this. These include:

1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical
   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This
   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily
   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this 
   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return
   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of
   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian
   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian
   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.
   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news
   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.

2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia
   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil
   sources from this region.

3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense
   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of
   Soveit Union.

The recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed
from Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict
of interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the
interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal
and friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the
rise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .

Please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed
in the ""O.T."".  It is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of
the intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their
demonstrations for the benefit of the media.  Having spoken to a Danish
reporter who covered the initfada, I know of at least one case where
he found out that a ""mass demonstration"" on the outskirts of Gaza was
setup for himself and his colleagues.  When I asked whether the footage
shot was sent he replied affirmatively, ""after all, it did happen.""
When this became the case, the IDF began closing sensitive trouble
spots to reporters.

         The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17
    To the children of genocide: ""Send them away into the Desert""

This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish 
wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders 
for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these
telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,
for example, we have the following set regarding children:

	""To the Government of Aleppo.

	 November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to
	 the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum
	 [hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem
	 families and received as servants when they are left alone through
	 the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect
	 all such children in your province and send them to the places of
	 deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to
	 the people.

				Minister of the Interior,

						Talaat"" [1]

	""To the Government of Aleppo.

	 September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the
	 time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their
	 lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.

				Minister of the Interior,
						Talaat"" [2]

	""To the General Committee for settling and deportees.

	 November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the
	 orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their
	 places of exile.

	 				Abdullahad Nuri. [3]


	""To the Government of Aleppo.

	 January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been
	 opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is
	 done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt
	 of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or
	 any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it
	 purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as
	 detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received
	 into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish
	 special orphanages for them.

				Minister of the Interior,

						Talaat."" [4]

	""To the Government of Aleppo.


	 Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures
	 to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with
	 the caravans.

				Minister of the Interior,

						Talaat"" [5]

	""From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.

	 At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows
	 of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is
	 not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by
	 Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble
	 in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned
	 out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of
	 deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent
	 away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.

				Minister of the Interior,

						Talaat"" [6]

In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs
about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and ""rationalizing"" this
ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:

	""I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for
	 its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks
	 it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I
	 shall die for it."" [7]


These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of
Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never
questioned these ""death march orders"" until 1986, during a time when the world
was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.

For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the
Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were
ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a
study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.

If one were to examine the sample ""authentic text"" provided in the Turkish 
Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it 
too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the 
Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or 
Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is
a forgery. 

Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,
Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide 
architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a 
heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a
focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.

This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological
denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only
crime was to be born Armenian.

Making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not
mentioning peace or agreement). I also know several tens of jokes about arabs
(palestinians) but I DO NOT post them to Usenet (Anyway,not to THIS newsgroup),
since I don't think I will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and
this is NOT my target.

Yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line,
so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better
thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. And if parents want their
children alive,I think it would be better that before they get out to throw
stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children
in the houses.

Well,It was about 3 years ago ,in the Intifada (The fact that  you can't
remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). I DO NOT think
that what the soliders did was correct. But I will not agree that they ""were
breaking their arms"".I saw that film,and,unlike in the USA,it was broadcasted
entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the ""arm-broken"" guys got
up and walked and used their arms very good. They guy who did it was interviewed
and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take
his orders,and spitted in his face. What ammount of truth exist in this
statement I cannot tell you,because I wasn't there. But the guy who did it was
in prison,if it makes you any good.

No,it didn't. The Israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle
east.It is still the only human army(as much as an ARMY can be human).To any
American who will claim the opposite,I can only remember the CNN broadcasting
of the American Solider who beat a Somalian boy. It was very cruel to see.But
I won't say because of this that the American army is cruel.

It is called 'The Justice'. We also demand that the x-Soviet Armenian 
Government admit its responsibility for the Turkish and Kurdish 
Genocide, render reparations to the Muslim people, and return the 
land to its rightful owners. The recognition of the Genocide has 
become an issue which cannot be delayed further, and it is imperative 
that artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

Are you the 'truelove' or 'falselove' of 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF
Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle? 

""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the
nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have
opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so. 
They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own
way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,
in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when 
people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and 
where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey
was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian
countries.""[1]

""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came
under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It
was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of
Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a
Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel).

""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without
interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy
of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced European countries.""[2]

""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw
is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into
action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves
happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3]

""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and
Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to
appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,
however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,
local courts immediately take them under their protection.""

""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are
living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is
more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition 
to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this 
sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the
dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in
the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of 
priests."" (A. Ubicini).[4]

	They lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those
tanks from advancing.  They also lasted days in '73.  There is little
evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.

	They evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
place over the Jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled
kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are
usually picked up in the morning.

    As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes

    A laudable precaution.  
    
    Every single thing you post about Israel is posted to portray
    Israel as negatively as you can.  Deliberate omissions are an
    integral part of the shtick.  And it's not only the incidents
    that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are
    fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  The
    absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.

    In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you 
    have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable 
    sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing 
    but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude 
    against Israel and the need to vent it.  
    
    This 'Center for Policy Research' stuff is nonsense.

Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are using
civilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If the
buffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it 
further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not just
kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more to
the shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... ""GETTING BACK""
...""GETTING EVEN"". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The least
it shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives of
civilians.

Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have been
disarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah does
not attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned up
Sheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdraw
from Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
make the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah 
subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.

Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border?
Not lately, eh?

Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would use
territory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be better
off with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troops
in Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not on
Israeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in the
past two years.

I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow
to anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an 
actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the 
Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were 
reversed perhaps they would moderate their ""retaliation"".

I know this paper well, and see it for the exercise in selective morality 
and judgement it is. Until such time as it recognizes that *any* religiously
based government is racist, exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
of ""separate but equal"" second-class treatment of minorities, it will 
continue to be known for its bias. If Jewish nationalism is racism, so is 
Islam; anywhere where people are allotted ""different rights"" according to 
race, religion or culture is ""racist"".

I hadn't lived very long in Sumgait, only eight years. I moved there from
Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred
to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is
Arutunian, my husband's name . . .

That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints 
and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the 
Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past 
year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because 
I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be 
involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they 
told me, ""Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for 
this kind of work."" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at 
the Armenians, like ""The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way
they've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,"" and ""Things 
will be just fine if we get rid of them all."" ""No problem, the Turks will 
help,"" they say, ""if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an 
hour."" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it 
would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. 
Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one 
even considered such an idea possible.

But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative 
people I would often ask, ""Where is this all leading, do people really not see
what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, 
there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going
on?"" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that 
everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of 
it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the
demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I 
hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were 
under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. 
The women told me, ""There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade."" I didn't 
believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that 
they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, ""Are you the First 
Secretary of our City Party Committee?"" He answers me, ""Yes."" And I ask him, 
""Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani 
flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know 
exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?"" And he tells
me, ""Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it."" Then I asked him
another question: ""And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering 
us? And he said, ""I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't 
anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.""

Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: ""No, we actually didn't 
anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain 
the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre."" Those are his 
exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the
Armenian SSR.

And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, 
because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors 
concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. 
But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so 
horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of
progress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in
or around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really 
a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.

For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my 
husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on 
the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, ""You're in bed? You don't 
know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they 
were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars 
and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they 
turned the car over and burned it."" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior
Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was 
returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my 
neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the 
middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they 
were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him
honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and 
I said, ""Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?"" And she said, 
""Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely
smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw 
that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, ""Don't break 
the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.
"" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was
torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians 
although he's an Azerbaijani.

While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova
is the first to look out the window and say, ""Look, there's a crowd out 
there."" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had 
already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian 
family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I 
don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my 
husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. 
There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things 
were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once 
wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished
the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they 
beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing 
the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on 
television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell 
us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't 
have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the 
Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.

At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, 
and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly 
off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down 
there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At 
first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, 
""Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there."" And he answered, ""I 
don't know, could be."" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw 
it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, 
he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging 
her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell 
down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their 
balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of 
blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two 
from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.

Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can
of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And
I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented
that woman, because I had just seen that.

I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, ""You kill me first, and then 
let them do what they want with the corpse."" But our neighbors, it's true, 
defended us, they said, ""There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, 
only Muslims live here."" Disaster missed us that time.

But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, 
came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's 
upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to 
balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as 
though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, 
and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look 
and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first 
time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the 
morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the 
Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them 
too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking
garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went 
toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you 
could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke 
Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, ""What do you want?"" And 
they answered, ""We want the Armenian family that lives here"" [pointing toward 
the second floor with their hands]. She says, ""I already told you, we don't 
have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman 
talking to you,"" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around
her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they 
seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing 
and left. That was the second time death was at our door.

I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, 
I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we 
really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth 
floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight 
months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to 
earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture 
and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,
everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything 
out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on 
the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that 
hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means 
that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to 
be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been 
foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of 
apartments. Something on the order of ""We'll move the Armenians out and take 
over their apartments.""

I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I 
came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the 
Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I 
knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in 
Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was 
bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were 
no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw 
all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.

I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I
went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they 
had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some 
Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and
joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with 
the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on 
the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure 
people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for 
the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But 
having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having 
thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. 
If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, 
and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to 
calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom
he could whisper at the last minute, ""Go and announce it on television: 
Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our 
neighbors from this massacre?"" Those crowds weren't such that there was no 
controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, 
mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature 
shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we 
noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were 
brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was 
saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend 
us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do 
it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, 
what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!
The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things 
I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They 
were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them
from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one 
o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They
hadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. 
When they returned to our building I told my husband, ""Lendrush, now the 
police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably 
going to find out and come to our aid."" Well, alas, no, there were to be no 
authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single 
ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,
beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,
and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, 
it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in 
Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they 
attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed
soldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there
is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and
I can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and 
from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, 
wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against 
that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using 
stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have 
guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under 
the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under 
Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get 
involved.

If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the
truth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five 
years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered 
me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and
some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become
outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a 
Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,
or the property of some magnate, or some ""mafia"": If I want to, I'll get you 
out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do 
something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most 
brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so
much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had 
the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,
I heard with my own ears: ""Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something
that you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so 
instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything 
will go fine for you."" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I 
do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.
And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see
it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed 
it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got 
involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to 
the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony 
about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know 
if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer 
believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all 
dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most 
important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that
all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in 
you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...

I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a
state that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.
Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a
son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,
Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or
rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to
make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:
When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in 
Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.
But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call 
anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off
for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they
liked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap 
their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.

Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an
Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. 
According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the
same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put
through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to
his mother and said, ""Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill
him? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.
. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart."" His 
mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, ""Valery, you can't go because 
I am afraid."" He says, ""Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, 
just have a look."" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's
parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a 
superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken 
everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian 
apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that 
the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows 
in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and 
Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already 
been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks 
ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we 
left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to 
Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this 
straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has
been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and
his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit 
them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in 
a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being 
kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought 
there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .

When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, 
throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if 
these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And
when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When
you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.

If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of 
things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped 
were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, 
that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, ""What happened?"" and she 
bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . 
those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that 
I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.

Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,
well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,
some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group
of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a
point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw
so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .

Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians
around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground
with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who 
don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when 
I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are 
not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they 
were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a 
single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan 
all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack 
anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there
could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't
know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are 
guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in
Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not
only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it 
seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; ""Did 
you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 
people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an 
Armenian?""

Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and
not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to
the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.
When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I 
couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already
mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, ""Why 
did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at 
these women who are strewn about on the floor?"" The overcrowding there was 
tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were
already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They 
cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but 
the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at 
it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they 
were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized
to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening
that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, 
was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored 
personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart 
advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.

But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, 
tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party
Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the
hand and said, ""Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.
I told him, ""No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of 
what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the 
traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . "" Oh 
yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even 
very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, 
expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, ""Oh, why 
did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,
you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came
to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are
already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at
them?"" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who 
he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head 
and hid it. Then I said, ""My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We 
didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!"" ""Well kill me, kill me!"" 
Muslimzade says to me, ""But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not
guilty."" And I say, ""OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give 
us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and 
raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, 
carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you 
then?"" ""You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't 
anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait."" I started 
laughing and said, ""It's truly funny."" He says, ""What could I do? We didn't 
know what to do."" And I say, ""I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell 
you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in 
front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross 
over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was 
during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;
either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran 
away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, 
excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, 
you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? 
That's right,"" I told him, ""the City party committee got confused, all the 
party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, 
they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with 
impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two 
days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would 
have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some 
Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told 
them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.""

And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was
the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later
arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to
the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We 
asked him, ""What? How? What will come of us?"" He openly said, ""You know, for 
us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll
stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later."" The 
General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all 
cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because 
the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;
as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When 
he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, 
by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, 
because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, 
and he said, ""There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's
horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely 
punished, in accordance with our laws."" And that's a quote. Then one mother 
throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,
""Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?"" They tried 
to calm her down, and he said, ""In order for us to conduct a proper 
investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you 
must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang 
who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe 
someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that 
you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having 
lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth 
about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge 
later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you 
can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The 
names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the
information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is 
necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening 
gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put 
the information into the urn.""

Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, 
people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she 
came up and said, ""You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as 
will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you 
please write it down for me."" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like
her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down
everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if 
it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that 
information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply 
can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, 
should someone say that black is white if it is really black?

   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani
SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council 
of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the 
one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their 
previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, 
and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very 
politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and 
when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, ""Where were
you personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to 
return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where 
it was all leading?"" he says, ""You're telling the truth. Let's not mince 
words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell 
you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole 
government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 
45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its 
fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.""
I say, ""So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting 
it?"" And he says, ""You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it 
in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . "" I say, ""Fine, 
you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have 
known. Why did no one help us?"" And he says, ""Well, OK, we didn't know what to
do"" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from 
Muslimzade. Later, when he said, ""You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is 
favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the 
Azerbaijanis . . . "" To this l answered, ""You know what . . . I'm speaking 
with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with 
Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, 
please, Comrade Mamedov, "" I asked him, ""What would you say about this
honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?"" Then he said, ""Yes, I 
admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we 
have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before 
the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign 
radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.""
And I say, ""There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's
possible to add anything more awful."" He says, ""Yes, I agree with you, I 
understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence."" I repeat that he
said ""unfortunate occurrence."" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what 
he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--
and said, ""Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . "" I take this to mean that 
he really thinks it's an ""unfortunate occurrence."" ""And of course,"" he says, 
""I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, 
but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being 
tried."" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, 
that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody 
affair.

Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in
Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an 
Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, ""What, they didn't
nail your husband? They screwed up."" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that
anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up
to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was
going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from 
February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, ""I don't know, 
Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't 
put it down as unexcused absence."" I was really discouraged by this. They all 
know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here 
they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying 
myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name
is Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a 
Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and 
said, ""Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . "" He looked at me askance
and said, ""And why are you""--he knows me by my previous last name--""why did
you get wrapped up in this mess?"" I say, ""What do you mean, why did I get 
wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,"" I tell him, ""I have an 
Armenian last name."" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as 
though he had eaten something sour, and said, ""I didn't expect that you would
. . . "" What did he mean by that? And ""how"" should he behave, the chief of the
pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a 
reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And 
if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what 
can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!
He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, 
the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .

By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked 
him ""Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return 
to Sumgait?"" he answered, ""Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't
want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I 
won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years."" I say, ""So you've got another
thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then 
in another 50 years it'll happen again?!"" I couldn't contain myself any more,
and I also told him, ""And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew
about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in 
Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received
complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did 
everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the 
way you treated them?"" And he says, ""You know, you're finally starting to 
insult me!"" He threw his pen on the desk. ""Maybe now you'll say I'm a 
scoundrel too?"" I say, ""You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't 
know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that 
comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.
""Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, 
that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had 
gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. 
""We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of 
the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of 
Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in
Sumgait."" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '
""Well, I walked down the street."" And I said, ""Walking down the street in any 
city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation
because I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you 
spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't 
know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd 
hear something quite different."" I told him, for example, that I drew my 
conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took
us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;
they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the 
neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I 
thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some
anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it
was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier 
accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything 
there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with
us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young 
people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they 
were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police
detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and 
tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when 
the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they 
withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of 
course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

   The comparison of the Palestinian situation with the Holocaust
is insulting and completely false.  Any person making such a rude
and false comparison is either ignorant of the Holocaust, or also
ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.

   To compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
of 6,000,000 Jews is racist in and of itself.

""Innocent civilians""???  Like the ones who set up the booby traps or
engaged in shoot-outs with soldiers or attack them with grenades or
axes?

And the rest of the world is getting used to Arab tactics of claiming
innocence for even the most guilty of the vile murderers among them.
Keep it up long enough and it will backfire but good.

Your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. I'm not

Rights of children violated by the State of Israel (selected
articles of the IV Geneva Convention of 1949)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Article 31:  No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised
against protected persons, in particular to obtain information
from them or from third parties.

Article 32:  The High Contracting Parties specifically agree that
each of them is prohibited from taking any measure of such a
character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination of
protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies not
only to murder, torture, corporal punishment (...) but also to any
other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or
military agents.

Article 33:  No protected person may be punished for an offence he
or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and
likewise measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited.

Article 34:  Taking of hostages is prohibited.

Article 49:  Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as
deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the
territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country,
occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.

Article 50:  The  Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of
the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working
of all institutions devoted to the care and education of
children.

Article 53:  Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or
personal property belonging individually or collectively to
private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities,
or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except
where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by
military operations.

PS: It is obvious that violations of the above articles are also
violations of the International Convention of the Rights of the
Child.

In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion.
Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to
do so.

However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass
in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot
accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I
urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect
threats.

PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that
justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967
are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called
pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can
never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.
It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the
law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not
normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have
drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to
compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy
endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day
will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,
in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic
affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any
more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their
traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western
democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that
most
American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile
outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect
Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.

DEPOSITION OF ZAVEN ARMENAKOVICH BADASIAN

   Born 1942
   Employed
   Sumgait Bulk Yarn Plant

   Resident at Building 34, Apartment 33
   Microdistrict No. 12
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


On February 27 my wife and I went to Baku to go shopping and returned to 
Sumgait at around five in the evening. We ran into one of my relatives at the 
bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,
near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a
fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you
standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says, 
""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're 
killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.

We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our 
courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were 
about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They
were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice 
or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.
They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and 
throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one 
has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a 
guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.

We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School 
No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families 
there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only 
known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani 
guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was 
nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We 
were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our 
microdistrict.

We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.

On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be
used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of 
them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I
asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be 
evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.""

I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with
him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here.""

About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out
the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come 
out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in 
their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I 
say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that 
the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down 
there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back 
door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and 
noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.

So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!
Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that
Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that 
we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the 
morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.

In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers 
took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there 
were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, 
about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor, 
nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was
just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything
they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his 
mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...

I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I
wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third
floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, 
with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of 
them.

There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, 
everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City
Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage 
was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being
sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to 
get the things any cheaper.

I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in
his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we 
worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw 
me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his 
feelings, of course.

A number of points.  You are making assumptions about the manner
in which the cards are used.  True, by law, all residents, citizens,
and tourists must carry a form of identification with them.  For
citizens, the standard ID is the ID card.  The purpose this serves
on a daily basis, wherein they are presented at public places,
is for the purpose of identifying the bearer.  This takes place
in banks (cashing checks), post offices (registered mail and such), etc...
Quite frankly, it was rare that I ever had to present my ID card
for such activities more than once per week.  There is no law or
requirement that forces people to wave their ID cards in public.
Furthermore, none of the services I outlined discriminate against
the bearer in any manner by having access to this information.

The only case that I can think of in which the Le'um field might
be taken into account is during interaction with the police,
based upon the scenario.  In general though, arab citizens are
clearly recognizable, as are non-arabs. Your argument therefore
becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field
is being used to discriminate against them officially.

I take issue with your assertions.  I think that Arab countries
do know that they have nothing to fear from ""Israeli expansionism"".
Militarily, Israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of
land under occupation to a hostile, armed, and insurgent population for a
sustained period of time.  As is, the intifada is heavily taxing
the Israeli economy.  Proof of this can be seen in the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon.  Israeli troops pulled back from the
Awali, and later from the Litani, in order to control the minimal
strip needed to keep towns out of range of Katyusha missile fire.
Public opinion in Israel has turned towards settling the intifada
via territorial concessions.  The Israel public is sufferring from
battle fatigue of sorts and the gov't is aware of it.

With regards to borders, let me state the following.  I may not agree
with the manner in which negotiations are being held, however the crux
of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating
a starting position.  The arab parties have called for total withdrawal
and a return to pre-48 borders.  If Israel were to state large borders,
the negotiations might never get under way.  If Israel were to state
smaller borders, then the arab countries might try and force even smaller
borders during the negotiations.  I think that leaving the matter to be
settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic
and sensible.

Your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a ""center for
policy research"".  Whether or not all of Vanunu's revelations were true has no
bearing on the fact that some were.  For disclosing ""state secrets""
after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that
said secrets are not to be made public, one should be punished.
As to which were and which weren't, I am under no moral obligation
to disclose that - quite the reverse in fact.
He was taken to court, tried, and found guilty.  You may take issue
with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the
concept of ""Secrets of state"", something which every democratic govt

I noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist
more than he documented the fact that they do exist.  The CLU noted,
which you evidently did not pay attention to, that they know of no such
reports or cases.  I am sorry to tell you but in a country of 4 mill,
as tightly knit as Israel, even if the matter of the arrest was not
made public, within a relatively short time frame, most people would know
about it.  My own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be
made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of X hours.
This would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an
announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation.

Well, I am sorry to say that your questions are slanted.  Such
questions are often termed ""tabloid journalism"" and are not
disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity.
Such questions were often used during the McCarthy era as
a basis for the witch-hunts that took place then.  To use
your own example, these questions might have been lifted
from the format used by Stalinist prosecutors that were looking
for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray
as a larger and dirtier picture.

My answers were not any more ""hysterical"" than the questions
themselves.  The problem is not that the q's were provocative,
it was that they were selective in their fact seeking.  You
fall into the same category of those who seek ""yes"" ""no"" answers
when the real answer is ""of sorts"".
I suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an
unequivocal NO, you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete
them as you see fit.  A sign of strength is the ability to look
You remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated
culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer, only to find that they

Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to ""expand its borders"" on the holiest day
of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.  Oh wait, you
chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact 
OPPOSITE to the point you are trying to make?  I don't think that it's
because it was the war that hit Israel the hardest.  Also, in 1967 it was
Egypt, not Israel who kicked out the UN force.  In 1948 it was the Arabs
who refused to accept the existance of Israel BASED ON THE BORDERS SET
BY THE UNITED NATIONS.  In 1956, Egypt closed off the Red Sea to Israeli
shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  And in 1982 the attack was a response
to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the Golan
Heights.  Children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and Israel
finally retaliated.  Nowhere do I see a war that Israel started so that 
the borders could be expanded.

revisionist, myopic, and incidental view of themselves and their place in the 
world. 

The resulting inability to address Armenian and Greek refutations of Turkey`s
re-write of history is to refer to me as a terrorist, and worse, claim --
as part of the record -- I took responsibility for the murder of 2 people!

What a pack of raging fools, blinded by anti-Armenian fascism. It's too bad

find non-Turks to de-humanize! Such will be their downfall!

Is there any Israeli a civilian, in your opinion ?

Now, I do not condone myself bombing villages, any kind of villages.
But you claim these are villages with civilians, and Iraelis claim they are 
camps filled with terrorists. You claim that israelis shell the villages with the
'hope' of finding a terrorist or so. If they kill one, fine, if not, too bad, 
civilians die, right ? I am not so sure. 

As somebody wrote, Saddam Hussein had no problems using civilians in disgusting
manner. And he also claimed 'civilians murdered'. Let me ask you, isn't there 
at least a slight chance that you (not only, and the question is very general, 
no insult) are doing a similar type of propaganda in respect to civilians in
southern Lebanon ?

Now, a lot people who post here consider 'Israeli soil' kind of Mediteranean sea.
How do you define Israeli soil ? From what you say, if you do not clearly 
recognize the state of Israel, you condone killing israelis anywhere.

Mr. Hernlem, it was YOU, not ME, who was showing a huge satisfaction for 3 
israelis (human beings by most standards, Don't know about your standards) killed.

If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a 
question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing
justifies murder. I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make
similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?


Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's
say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does
it show? It does not qualify for freedom fighting to me ? But again, I may be

I agree with Shai,  there are many references to Israeli
plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard 
evidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a report
commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is 
still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned
a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe.
The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon,
flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and
discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre.
There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani
that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.  
The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water
from the Litani into these, then the water would flow
naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence
of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least
3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and
occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent 
reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.
Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.
It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells
tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the
Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed
under use they would be costly to operate 
(high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should 
agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers
as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral
negociations on ""regional issues"".  The fact that we have
been at war all this time has led to the current state
of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is
completely unregulated.

Very simple.

""X-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
 against 2.5 million Muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
 reparations to the Turks and Kurds.""

After all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim
people between 1914 and 1920.

You must be a new Armenian clown. You are counting on ASALA/SDPA/ARF 
crooks and criminals to prove something for you? No wonder you are in 
such a mess. That criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
already been trashed out by Mutlu, Cosar, Akgun, Uludamar, Akman, Oflazer 
and hundreds of people. Moreover, ASALA/SDPA/ARF criminals are responsible 
for the massacre of the Turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
Turkiye and TRNC. SDPA has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
calls for the second genocide of the Turkish people. This racist, barbarian 
and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-Soviet Armenian government 
as merely a step on the road to said genocide.

You are the biggest liar I have ever seen.This example showed me that tomorrow
you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.So I decided
not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.I also advise
all the netters to do the same.We can not prevent your lies, but at least
we may save time by not dealing with your lies.

And for the following line:

 Please, can you tell us why those quotes are ""crap""?..because you do not

 You couldn't reject it...

 Here we go again..
 In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give 
 the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!
 (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of
 pages, please ask by sct) 
 
 
I really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
What I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
the given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
groundless accussations, etc.

 I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
 and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
 in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you
 are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
 
 Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
 
 First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You
 called Serdar Argic a liar!..
 I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
 (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
 
 And now, you are lying again and talking about ""modified,re-published book""
(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
 (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty 
  well suited theories', as usual)
 
 And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
 wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number
 and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                 949.6 R 198
   
  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
              
     
 
> 
>It is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has

 Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying ""it is
 not possible..."" ..If not, what is your point?
 
 Differences in the number of pages?
 Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..
 No need to use the same book size and the same letter 
 charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
 
 The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
 first published.. 
 And you tried to hide the whole point..
 the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
 how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given 
 by Serdar Argic exist!! 
 It was the issue, wasn't-it?  
 
 you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? 
 
 You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a ""crap""..
 People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still
 has so many ""craps"" in the 1993. 
 
 Any question?

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,
women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and 
those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

Not a chance.

Typical Mutlu.  PvdL asks if X happened, the response is that Y

what they are accused of.

The Armenians were deeply anti-semitic as well. In the May 10, 1936 
edition of 'Hairenik Weekly' the vice-mayor of Bucharest, Rumania is 
quoted as saying:

""The Armenians helped us not to become the slaves of the Jewish
 elements in our country.""

In another edition, an author named Captain George Haig writes:

""And the type of Jew who is imported to Palestine...is not anything
 to be proud about. Their loose morals, and other vices were
 unknown to the Arabs prior to Balfour Declaration, on top of 
 all communist activities were the cause of most of the Arab
 criticism.""[1]

As Uzun exposed, the Armenians were fascist. Before Pearl Harbor, 
the Dashnak daily 'Hairenik' (not to be confused with the Tzeghagrons
'Hairenik Weekly') expressed pro-Nazi sentiments:

""And came Adolf Hitler, after herculean struggles. He spoke
 to the racial heart strings of the German, opened the 
 fountain of his national genius, strock down the spirit
 of defeatism...At no period since the World War had Berlin
 conducted so realistic, well organized, and planned policy
 as now, since Hitler's assumption to power...And whatever
 others may think concerning Hitlerism and Fascism as a 
 system of Government, it is proved that they have revitalized
 and regenerated the two states, Germany and Italy.""[2]

Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and
prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in
principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the
peace talks. Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided
upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The
newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently
made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian
delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded
that the delegates not go to Washington to, ""sell out the
Palestinian people."" One caller threatened, ""Should you go, you
will not find your family alive upon your return."" The newspaper
states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at
the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others.

At issue was not a trial behind closed doors, but arrest, trial and
imprisonment in complete secrecy.  This was appraently attempted in the
case of Vanunu and failed.  It has happened before, and there is reason
to believe it still goes on.

Read this:

From Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992

PUBLICATION BAN

        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many
        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were
        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of
        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever
        being made public.

By Baruch Me'iri

All those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way
or another: ""Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I
will be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific
case, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something
which may legally not be published"".

The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years
there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to
long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the
crimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More
precisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of
their arrest, and later on their imprisonment.

In Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of
this country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about
the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,
for security offenses, in complete secrecy.

In the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]
affair -- we heard about ""the third man"" being in prison.  But many
years have passed since then, and what existed then can today no
longer be found even in South American countries, or in the former
Communist countries.

But it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.

The Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and
Justice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this
week to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet
Legal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:

""During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been
imprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of
these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the
specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but
even on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after
being legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison
without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the
prisoner"", asserts MK Zucker.

On the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, ""There is
absolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is
imperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of
security offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases
the Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances
under which a trial will not be held in public.

""However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on
the mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person
sentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of
Israel.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to
know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public
sight and his descent into the abyss of prison.""

Zucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of
Justice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider
the question.  ""The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the
cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The
State of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention
and its cause is kept secret"", wrote Zucker.

The legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai
Shiffman said that, ""We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any
cases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,
and whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation
which, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like
censorship is an unhealthy matter"".

""The Union is aware"", says Shiffman, ""of cases where notification of a
suspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am
speaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee
was not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole
first month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.

""The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --
can challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where
the family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The
journalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is
happy...""

Attorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the
laws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a
person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. 
""Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's
that.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long
years in prison without us knowing anything about it.""

-- Do you find this situation acceptable?

Attorney Arnon: ""Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and
such a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that
publication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but
total non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of
Mordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged
with aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The
trial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for
those who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,
though not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least
are aware of his imprisonment.""

-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the
discretion of the court?

Attorney Arnon: ""The judges have no choice but to trust the
presentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to
investigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which
they can misuse.""

-- And what if there really is a security issue?

Attorney Arnon: ""I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.
 Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible
to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without
entering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning
publication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller
murder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the
matter being made public.""

Attorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can
be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's
arrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  ""A healthy
situation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere
publication may be harmful to state security"".

A different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former
advisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda
Meir.  ""Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such
situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must
be held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom
of expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom
which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.

""Nevertheless"", adds Shtendal, ""the legislator allowed for the
possibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the
damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that
which may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.
The authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with
the Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which
we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has
been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.""

Nevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: ""As a rule, clearly such a
phenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in
the most extreme circumstances.""

Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag' 
and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians 
committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of 
despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned 
them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound 
hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated 
personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most 
unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.
                               

AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the
Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.

""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""
the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to
be alive.""

Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the
2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the
edge of Karabakh.

""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy
machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.

To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam
about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,
until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.

""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by
a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening
fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.

Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward
to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
67-year-old elder brother.

""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""
he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We
have never got any of the bodies back.""

The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he
struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
crossing, Mr Sadikov said.

Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and
several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy
hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.

As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was
little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
soon to flee.

""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian
rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I
had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.
They even found a bullet in my sock.""

I guess, I didn't make my point clear.  In the case of Israel government, it 
is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy.  After all, not many
people are intimidated just by talking.  Here how it goes: tough talks,
followed by aggressive actions followed by taking pride of those actions and

FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.

Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz

Subject: Torture

Title of article: Moderate physical pressure

Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation
room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,
beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a
Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.
""At those moments"", Omar said, ""I felt that he was like a
humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat
me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed
yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being"".

In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm
prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. ""Among the Jews,
as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people"", he said
after his release, ""but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations
rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that
he is a human being"". Although he left the detention installation
in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (""I sat at home for ten days. My
hands shook from nerves""), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He
got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned
to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.

In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released
seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the
Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or
react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early
August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left
it one day later - dead. ""We have recently received an especially
large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at
the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators"", noted
Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and
Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)

The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan
Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely
fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated
in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would
return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.

(...follow description of tortures....)

Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. ""I do not want to talk about
it"", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and
ashamed, he spoke: ""Sometimes he beats you and beats you until
you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of
another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,
and the last interrogator says:"" Now you are kissing my hand, and
later if I want, you will kiss my ass.""

These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,
located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West
Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In
early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the
Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to
visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation
wing. ""The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely
under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by
it"", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the
installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem
member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,
governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command,
was quoted in the report:  ""There is an ethical problem here - no
one can enter the interrogation wing"".

Indeed, I find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction

What compromise are you talking about on Cyprus. That is not Greece
business to join the island to Greece. That is up to people in the island
to live or not to live together. They made their decision and they are
living  separetely now.There is a peace there. Greeks can't slaughter
Turks anymore because turkish peacemaking force is there.

Are you joking or dreaming? We can declare our 12 miles territorial
water which can come close to Athens. How would you like it?
If you have any guts why don't you shoot at some Turkish ships
in your dream 12 mile territorial waters?
We do not have any city called Konstantinople. We have a city
called ISTANBUL!!!! All the greeks in Istanbul are being
treated just any other Turks. There is no difference among people
in Turkey. You look at your own backyard first before talking
about human rights in Turkey. What are the rights of Turks in Greece?
Nothing. They do not even have basic human rights like right to
have property, fredom of religion, fredom of press, fredom of
vote elect their community leaders. Government of Greece publicly
encourages people to destroy and burn schools, religious places,
houses, and farms belong to turkish minority. Then, Greek government
forces these minorities to go to Turkey without anything with them.
You will dream to see Aegean sea as Greek lake but it will never
happen. Think about the war between Turkey and Greece in 1915.
The river called SAKARYA flood 21 days filled with blood in 1915.

You mean that any person who supports the actions and policies of the
government of Greece is a good person. That is your Greek idea to
say Turks are bad people. We know who we are and proud to be TURKS
anywhere in the world. That is not Greeks business to tell us what
kind of people we are. You are not at position to judge people because
you are not civilized enough to give equal rights to your own minorities.
Millions of minorities are being treated as third class citizen,
their rights are taken away from them, and they have no voices under
the Government of Greece. They are almost being treated as slaves
even though we are getting into 21th century. Therefore, do not make me
laught at you.

**They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.

The Government of Greece is actively supporting terrorism against
Turkey.Armenian and Kurdish terrorists have headquarters in Athens.
They are being trained in special camps in Greece. They are taught how to
kill innocent women and children.This not a claim, this is a fact known
by whole world. In conlusion, you are in action to murder, rape,
destroy the innocent people. I do not take you seriously because you
are not at any positions to talk about human rights and dignity.
Your own government, the Government of Greece actively supports
atrocities in Bosnia. Serbs's Barbarism pleases your government.
Please Napoleon think twice before you write anything about Turks and
Turkey. You are the worst in human right conditions and treatment of
the minorities. Who wants to be a fried with someone whose government
does not respect the human rights, supports terrorism in Turkey,barbaric
actions in Bosnia, treats Turkish minorities as third class citizen and
take away all of their rights, treating them as slaves at the beginning
of 21th century???????

Based on the same reasons?  You mean you were opposed to US intervention in
Somalia because since Somalia is a European country instead of the third world,
the desire to help Somalia is racist?  I don't think this ""same reason"" applies
to Somalia at all.

The whole point is that Somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more
willing to send troops there than to Bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what
the ""fixation on European countries"" theory would predict.  (Similarly, the
desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite
of what that theory predicts.)

I'm referring to people who want to help at all, of course.  You don't see
people sending out press releases ""help Bosnian Serbs with ethnic cleansing!
The Muslim presence in the Balkans should be eliminated now!""  (Well, except
for some Serbs, but I admit that the desire of Serbs in America to help the
Serbian side probably _is_ because those are people more like them.)

HELSINKI WATCH: ""PROBLEMS OF TURKS IN WESTERN THRACE CONTINUE""

Ankara (A.A)  In a 15-page report  of the ""Helsinki Watch""  it is
stated that the Turkish minority in Western Thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the Greek Government be brought to an end.

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government

GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS

The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek
state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish
minority with Turkey.

Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is
called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the
minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with
the Greek  newspaper ""Ethnos"" he said:  ""I am a Greek  citizen of
Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western
Trace are also Turkish.""

Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in
Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement
signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey
in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.

Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.
SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,
Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented
Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European
countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal
rights.""

On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are
predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical
reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign
powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by
cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was
will to improve relations with Greece.

MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.

Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in
Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a
Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.

  Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)
have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in
an Athenian magazine.

  Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly
magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as
Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would
field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek
general election.

  Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.""
Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise
Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations
against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the
border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC
are falling.""

  The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court
summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false
information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the
citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the
international interests of the country (Greece).""

  The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a
Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to
1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely
concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state
if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.

  In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned
Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian
villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in
1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5
million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000
in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.

  Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian
human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a
few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in
the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced
the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of
Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the
majority of ethnic Macedonians live.

  Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in
which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,
especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its
northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.

  Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned
Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who
largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the
US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections
are over.

During WWII, the British managed to supply arms to the Yugoslavs despite
German occupation.  If the Europeans had the will to do anything besides
sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of
weapon they wanted into Bosnia.

I guess I would favor ending the embargo if the Congress would pass a law
forbidding export of US military supplies to Yugoslavia, including via third
parties.  Until then the risks of the US being drawn into a more active
role would be too great.  I do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
the outcome of the war.

Both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  And that's
about all we have to go on, isn't it?  

And I wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  There are many levels
at which people react to what they see.  At the most fundamental level, you
do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to
empathize more with people who are like yourself.  As far preferring
Christian over Moslem, I am an atheist myself, and I think you'll agree that
in the US, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.

Amir: 
Why would you categorize the sale of land as shafting? was
it because it was sold to Jews? was it fair to assume that the 
fallahin would be mistreated by the jews? is this the norm of 
any commerce (read shafting) between arabs and  jews? 

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine
(if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandate
treaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, while
Palestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlord
would have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would
be motivated to sell, regardless of the price.

It is interesting though that you acknowledge that the
palestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews share
your opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser from
any ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down? 

All told, I did not see an answer in your response. The
question was whether the intent behind the purchase was
aimed at controlling the public assets (land,
infra-structure etc...). IMHO the Palestinians have grounds
to contest the legality of the purchase, say in world court.

ALL Jews suffered during WWII, not just our beloved who perished or were

	WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesday
ruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relations
with Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if that
government disassociates itself from international terrorism.
	``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across the
Gulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostility
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistant
secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.
	The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''
which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the Arab
Israeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.
	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace but
first it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''
	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promoting
Gulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very high
on the agenda of the U.S. administration.''
	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State Warren
Christoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhere
else in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-term
plan to station troops in the Gulf.
	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue to
pressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N. Security resolutions.''
	``As long as Iraq is ruled by Saddam Hussein we do not expect
compliance,'' Mack told delegates.

G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the  
Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  
absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  
from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  
partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  
defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.

First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  
idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  
claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  
bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  
to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  
promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  
possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  
national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  
is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  
and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  
continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  
can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  
Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  
the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  
Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  
leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  
going to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town  
on a rail.

Interesting statement.  Especially when you consider that Lebanon
had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
Israel.  Of course, one of the prime obstacles to Israel's complete
withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
to the area as well as the large presence of Syrian forces which
have not been asked to withdraw as well.

Actually, one such Jew who did risk his life to help Gazan Arabs was

Well done Hamza. You edited my answer to Anas Omran, took everything out
of context and then replied to it the way you wanted.
Now I really understand why the peace process is not making any progress.

You guys ain't listening, just babbling away to your same old rhetoric.

[HE]	Fizuli, Lacin and several villages (in Azerbadjan)

Greater Armenia would stretch from Karabakh, to the Black Sea, to the

[HE]	escape the from Lacin, a city that was ""given"" to the Kurds
[HE]	by the Armenians. 

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh 
by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to 
power last year, he announced he would be be ""swimming in Lake Sevan [in 
Armeniaxn] by July"". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the 
Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey 
is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If 
Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of 
Kelbajar, his people will pay the price. 

It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they
are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just 
look at the situation with the Lezgians.

About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there 
are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there 
are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this ""60 
Kurd refugee"" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in 
Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border 
with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the ""intercepting"" of Armenian military 
conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by 
somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed 
""special correspondent"" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!

[h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane 
[h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one
[h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane
[h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.
[h]

No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.

[HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes
[HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities
[HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
[HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.
[HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of
[HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not
[HE]	humanitarian aid.....

Your ""facts"" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey 
have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes
were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments 
were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey
for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was
confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with ""crap"" and dirt, then
shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.
uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which
they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish 
chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed 
anything other than a paranoid Turkish military. 

[HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.
[HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 

Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan
from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!

[HE]	Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
[HE]	to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan
[HE]	it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons
[HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 

You are correct, all Turkish planes should be simply shot down! Nice, slow

	Were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory Palestine?
Since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly
constructed, is irrelevant.  I will however, respond to a few points
you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.


>They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

	And those fleeing Arab lands, where Jews were second class
citizens. 

>Plus they paid fair market value, etc...

	Jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land
they bought.

>They did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy.

	You know, Sam, when people start talking about an
International Jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like
anti-Semitic bull.

	The reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple.
Zionists made no bones about what was going on.  There were
conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a National
home for the Jews.

	Because you've never heard of it, its dead?  The fact is, you
claimed Israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant)
International aid.  Then you see that that argument has a hole you
could drive a truck through, and again assert that Israel is only
democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group.
The problem with that argument is that Arabs are allowed to vote for
whoever they please.  So, please tell me, Sam, what constraints are
there on Israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic
states?

	I've never heard anything about the Khazakistani arab
population.  Does that mean that they have no history or roots?  When
I was at Ben Gurion university in Israel, one of my neighbors was an
Israeli arab.  He wasn't really all that different from my other
neighbors.  Does that make him dead or oppressed?

	How recent is recent?  I can probably build a case for a
Jewish Gaza city.  It would be pretty silly, but I could do it.  I'm
arguing not that Jerusalem is Jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.

The wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, 1978 were definitely started by the Arabs.
The war in 1982 was instigated by the Arabs who continually murdered
Israeli children with their rocket attacks.  Israel was only trying to
stop this.

Diaspora 'a cancer'
------------------- by Julian Kossoff and Lindsay Schusman in:
Jewish Chronicle, London, 22. Dec. 1989

Leading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,
launched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth
Council meeting in North London, last week.

The diaspora, he claimed, ""was the cancer connected to the main
tissue of the Jewish people"". He was scathing about its failure to
act before the Holocaust.

He said the diaspora's religious and secular leadership had
ignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed
Zionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, ""the failure
of Judaism"".

His talk, entitled ""Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution"", covered 5,000
years of Jewish history.

Mr. Yehoshua's other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he
said ""not staying [in Israel], but running [away]"", and all Jews
outside Israel ""who were using other people's countries like
hotels"".

The only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was
immoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived
elsewhere.

Worse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her
citizens, who were leaving by the thousands.

Mr. Yehoshua, who described himself as ""a soldier for aliyah"",
ended by calling for the creation of a new ""total Jew"", living in
Israel.

Earlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the
difficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,
Mr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the
country's political situation.

He said Israel's wars had once provided writers with a vital
source of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing
directly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been
produced about the intifada.

Instead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,
emigration from Israel and personal and family issues.

Mr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the
Israeli political situation. He could no longer step into an
Israeli Arab's shoes and portray him as a real ""flesh and blood
character"".

He claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of
Israeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too
pre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,
and were not concerned with the nature of that identity.

Jewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
unlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the
country they lived in, he said.

He warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish
people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
literary circles. It faced fierce competition from the English
language.

Pardon me?

""Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies""

While World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks 
Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity
of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.


Dr. Sadik Ahmet, Turkish Ethnic Member of Greek Parliament, Visits US

Washington DC, July 7- Doctor Sadik Ahmet, one of the two ethnic
Turkish members of the Greek parliament visited US on june 24 through
July 5th and held meetings with human rights organizations and
high-level US officials in Washington DC and New York.

At his press conference at the National Press Club in Washington DC,
Sadik Ahmet explained the plight of ethnic Turks in Greece and stated
six demands from Greek government.

Ahmet said ""our only hope in Greece is the pressure generated from
Western capitals for insisting that Greece respects the human rights.
What we are having done to ethnic Turks in Greece is exactly the same
as South African Apartheid."" He added: ""What we are facing is pure
Greek hatred and racial discrimination.""

Spelling out the demands of the Turkish ethnic community in Greece
he said ""We want the restoration of Greek citizenship of 544 ethnic
Turks. Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this
people have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens
and are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in
the Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are
not subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of
Greek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in
the United States.""

""We want guarantee for Turkish minority's equal rights. We want Greek
government to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.
Our people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek
government is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating
our buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are
not hired to the government offices.""

""Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity
in business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the
economic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license
necessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact
that I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the
necessary steps in my career.""

""We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed
to call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of
law suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself
a Turk.""

""We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.""

In separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated
that the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of
Greek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,
he said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)
and only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not
want to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said
that Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out
of the parliament as an independent representative and they stated
this fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification
requirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,
they imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including
the Turkish candidates.

Ahmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.
He earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.
he served in the Greek military as an infantryman.

In 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time
by collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation
of laws against ethnic Turks. In 1986, he was arrested by the police
for collecting signatures.

O.K., its my turn:

       DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA ?!

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed
to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their
plan !

(Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity
since it was coined by Bnai Brith)

What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,
is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic
Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in
Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.

However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their
homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.

As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.

Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true
super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the
Jews used to establish their state : Religion.

April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):

Basically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied 
territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe 
continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they 
leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that 
the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a
reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....
and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim: 

There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The
first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so
there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in 
exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. The second
is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that
these ""tangible concessions"" be made by Israel **without** it receiving
anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances
seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns
for its expected concessions. By ""tangible"" is meant something that
1) provides Israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to 
give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine 
**will be** accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically) 
responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens 
or ""visitors"").

In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian
statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel
was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** 
co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel 
from its territory.
	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,
	how *could* such ""guarantees"" be instilled? For example,
	how could such ""guarantees""/""controls"" be added to the
	Palestinian PISGA proposals?

Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", gives
full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties
could (and *would*, if not ""controlled"" somehow) EASILY return to the 
traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*
ensure that that will not happen.

So I should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to
Islam. Or, to convert me to ANYTHING. 

There are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.

'Trying' to convert is an insult. It's like trying to tell me that me and/or
my God/my lack of God are just crap, that I need a new, 'converted' one.

This does not apply for muslims only, of course. Same for jews and for some
friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
and cheap booklets about some church ....

And when the objective is (I think, however that you are wrong) to convert 
everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.


Aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
violence' ? 

Why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care 
your business?. You do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are)
as long as you want to change their thinking.

Typical 'Arromdian' of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism

and national origin?

I think this part of the translation is questionable. Although I
think the original quote is plain silly, you made it sound as if
it is coming from a neo-nazi youth. For example, Turks talk of a
""motherland"" not a Germanic ""fatherland"". Why ""filth"" instead of
""dirt""? The indeterminacy of translation is a well-known problem
[1] so one may have to ""fudge"", but with some care of course. Is
the following an equally valid translation?

The love of one's country is the strongest wind to cleanse one's
soul.

See my point?

Nevertheless, I think you translate well.

   I have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by
this anti-Israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable
sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously, it
is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published
documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so.  

   Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising
in itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was
curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind
his phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some
typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is
he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it
there, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?  

   Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  It will
help put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  And the readers
of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-Israel
hyperbola can ignore this junk.

Arab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. First
of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgun
and Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.
The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact,
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin.

By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killing
was unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.
Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the
Holocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The
village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.

       I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS
    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday
    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate
    points.

    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of
    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the
    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:

    - It was alleged that:"" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological
    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of
    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. ""!
    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives 
    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology
    in Iran after revolution.

    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors
    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen
    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in
    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and
    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.

    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi
    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most
    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total
    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million
    dead left from the war.

    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For
    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: "" It hurts me to
    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda."" The 
    translator says: "" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly 
    research.""!

    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought
    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to 
    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's
    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in
    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.

    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of 
    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the
    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed
    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account
    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its
    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the
    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries
    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones
    in scientific and industrial efforts.

    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as
    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from
    Iran's different sites. They say: ""We are not sure if the places visited
    by IAEA are the real ones or not"" !, or "" We can not rely on IAEA's
    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear
    activities before"" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build
    nuclear weapons!

    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the
    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,
    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking
    from the absolute knowledge!

       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their
    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to
    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs
    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.

Hi Brad,

I have two comments:  Regarding your hope that the ""occupation will end... 
belive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e.,
peace and cooperation.  I can't help but wonder what would happen if all
violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs
would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be 
maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,
greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
""territories"".  

Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work
also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel
Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,
i.e., no winners.

Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding
to ""stiff resistance"" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.
troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis
could not.

Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.

Respectfully,     

Ben.

After reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.

The NY Times reported on April 18, 1993 that the museum ""was built
through private contributions on Federal land"".  Your hate-mongering
article is devoid of current and historical fact, intellectual content
and social value.  Down the toilet it goes.....

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might
wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it.
As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks
on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you
count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally
think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires
organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.
Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was
so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone
organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause
for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the
'Zionist' camp.

>Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.

Now you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start
with the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.
And the previous posters were wrong, no?

>Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets
>against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?

Again I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think
war requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command
and plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you
sure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds
like war to me. Stone throwing does not.

The investment was there in the form of huge tax breaks, and employer

True, which leads to the obvious question, should any investment have

and still is a resounding no.

The lengthy article you quote doesn't imply this.  It only states that
it is somehow POSSIBLE, not that it is in any way likely.  This is akin
to an article saying that it is POSSIBLE that the USAF has several
captured UFOs, without supporting the liklihood of such an assertion.

In other words, they were telling a pesky reporter to keep guessing.

Israel maintains this same attitude about nuclear weapons it may or
may not have.  The US maintains the same attitude about the presence
of nuclear weapons on specific naval craft.  By refusing to
acknowledge the existence of such weapons on specific ships, US
warships have, I believe, become unwelcome in New Zealand, which has
declared itself a nuclear-free-zone.

The USAF has never officially admitted to having any UFOs, either.

This is stated as a fact without supporting evidence.  It would've
been more convincing if your reporter had come up with just one name
of someone who is sitting in jail, lost to the world, as he suggests.
Maybe Elvis, or JFK, somebody.  

Let's put it this way: If Israel has put people away without
publicizing their arrests or the legal proceedings against them, how
has their disappearance been explained?  People have relatives,
friends and colleagues, you know.  Israel is not known as a place
where people are made to vanish.  Would you care to give us a list of
people whose whereabouts are unknown?  People who are presumed to be
imprisoned?  This whole conspiracy story isn't something that we've
come to associate with Yigal Arens before.  Perhaps from now on, we
should.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I've heard many Turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
it.Remember the Treaty of Sevres-as a consequence of being in the Axis powers
in WWI.The Turks UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW were supposed to look after their
minorities ie. Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are 
improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.
The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted 
Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH
and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.
    In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government
managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after 
the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,
FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the 
FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH
as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.

   [snip]
   In the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
   Lebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is 
   disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich
   or any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed 
   solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.

I agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc... is
not terrorism.  That having been said, lets continue.

   [snip]
   imagine ????  It is NOT a ""terrorist camp"" as you and the Israelis like 
   to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
   in the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....

I would not argue that all or even most of the villages are ""terrorist
camps"".  There are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion. 

   SOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of
   the Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not 
   know who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often
   suspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are
   supported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and
   ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
   for Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured
   by these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
   of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they
   are back they announce that they bombed a ""terrorist  hideout"" where
   an 8 year old girl just happened to be.

Some of the villages, and yours might well be among them, are as you
describe.  Not all are.  There are a large number of groups in the area,
backed by various organizations, with a wide range of purposes.  Hizbollah
and Amal were two of the larger ones and may still be.  As to retaliation,
while mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing, which would have produced major casualties.

   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that
   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance
   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING 
   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real 
   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.

Well, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if
the Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks.

   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to
   realize that the concept of a ""buffer zone"" aimed at protecting
   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more
   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel
   would have resulted in.  

Actually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though.

   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese
   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such 
   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is
   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
   in all other parts of Lebanon.

No, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another
Lebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.

   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing
   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.

No, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.
