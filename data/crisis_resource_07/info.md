# Dataset Info


## Categorization
Only tweets with `relevant` labels are considered. The other tweets have been removed. Then, some files are merged to group tweets with similar context. The details of which files were merged as follows:

+ Categorized as `earthquake`:
- `nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_train.tsv`
- `nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_dev.tsv`
- `nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_test.tsv`

+ Categorized as `flood`:
- `queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_train.tsv`
- `queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_dev.tsv`
- `queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_test.tsv`

**Note:** The original filename of each tweet can be found in the column `original_filename`.


## Data description
This datasets consist of tweets collected during the 2015 Nepal Earthquake and the 2013 Queensland Flood. The annotation of relevant and irrelevant (not_relevant) categories consist of 11,668 tweets for the Nepal Earthquake dataset and 10,033 tweets for the Queensland dataset.

For each dataset, we also release ids of the tweets of the unlabelled data that we used for our experiments. One can use our Tweet retrieval tool (available on CrisisNLP.qcri.org) to download the tweets based on ids provided in the datasets.


## Data formats
Each .tsv file contains 3 columns separated by tab: 1) id, 2) text of the tweet, and 3) class label. The .txt file contains tweets ids, which are not labeled. 

2015 Nepal Earthquake:
--------------
nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_train.tsv -- 7000 labeled tweets
nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_dev.tsv  -- 1166 labeled tweets
nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_test.tsv  -- 3502 labeled tweets
nepal/2015_Nepal_Earthquake_unlabelled_ids.txt -- 864,966 un-labeled tweet ids


2013 Queensland Flood:
---------------
queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_train.tsv -- 6019 labeled tweets 
queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_dev.tsv -- 1003 labeled tweets 
queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_test.tsv -- 3011 labeled tweets
queensland/2013_Queensland_Floods_unlabelled_ids.txt -- 21,917  un-labeled tweet ids
