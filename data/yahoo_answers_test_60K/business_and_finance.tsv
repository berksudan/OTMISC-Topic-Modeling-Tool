You need 2 lights to get contrast.  Set one at 10 O'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  Put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  Use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in Photoshop to delete out the background.  Support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  Keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  That's about it!

References just need to people who can speak to what kind of person you are. Generally you can't use family members, but otherwise, anyone who knows you and can speak to your reliability and skills would work. Teachers can be good references.

"The best home business depends on what you want, how you define to be interesting. A person may consider a pet sitting business to be the most exciting work in the world, while another person would rather watch TV than take care of dogs. \n\nThe key is to determine what your interests are, what you want to do, what is suitable for your lifestyle and your overall goals, and what can fit with your resources.\n\nDan Ramsey in his book ""101 Best Home Businesses"" has a chapter on how to find YOUR best home business.

"Like THAT (1st link) ^_^. It looks like our keyboards with hiragana on it, so I guess there's a way to change between writing romanji (english lettering) and hiragana.

The second link is a hiragana chart on my website kinda, in case you'd like to know more about how that works. You can go to yahoo, images search and type ""japanese keyboard"" if you wanna find more. That's what I did ^_^ goodluck.

As answered in a previous question, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs around the U.S. Landing one depends on your experience and education. \n\nI recommend looking at two of the larger corporate conglomerates for careers, as they own the most death care businesses across the U.S. Those companies are the Alderwoods Group, Service Corporation Internation, aka Dignity Memorial and Stewart Enterprises.

Chlamydia remains the most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States. In 2004, 929,462 chlamydia diagnoses were reported, up from 877,478 in 2003. Even so, most chlamydia cases go undiagnosed. It is estimated that there are approximately 2.8 million new cases of chlamydia in the United States each year\n\nGonorrhea is the second most commonly reported infectious disease in the United States, with 330,132 cases reported in 2004. From a high of 467.7 cases per 100,000 population reported in 1975, the U.S. gonorrhea rate fell to 113.5 in 2004 (a 76% decline) — the lowest recorded level since reporting began in 1941. More recently, from 2003 to 2004, the rate fell 1.5 percent (from 115.2 cases per 100,000 population to 113.5). Like chlamydia, however, gonorrhea is substantially under diagnosed and under reported, and approximately twice as many new infections are estimated to occur each year as are reported.\n\nSyphilis: Cases Increase for Fourth Consecutive Year\nThe rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis — the most infectious stages of the disease — decreased throughout the 1990s, and in 2000 reached an all-time low. However, over the past four years the syphilis rate in the United States has been increasing. Between 2003 and 2004 alone, the national P&S syphilis rate increased 8 percent, from 2.5 to 2.7 cases per 100,000 population; during this time, reported P&S cases in the United States increased from 7,177 to 7,980.\n\n\nWow was that person ever guessing get the facts...

You would have to add up all the prices of shares times the number of shares for the proper weighting they recive in the index or etf. Then add up all the earnings per share times the number of shares. Then divide those two numbers. \n\nThe forward P/E you would have to estimate NOT only what those companies will make next year, but what the companies  are added and what are dropped. This is not realy even possible assuming you had a good crystal ball to estimate what a company would make if you knew exactly which company to calculate it for.\n\nThat is a lot of work.

"The word ""Yahoo"" was originated in English by Jonathan Swift in his tremendously influential novel of 1726, ""Gulliver's Travels."" In Gulliver's fourth journey, he visited a land populated by an intelligent race of horses called the Houyhnhnm, who are completely controlled by reason and rational thought. They dominate the a race of hideous beasts known as Yahoos, who are human beings in the same form as Gulliver. Gulliver soon befriends the Houyhnhnm despite his own Yahoo-like appearance and soon loathes the race of Yahoos. When he returns home at the end of his voyage, since the Houyhnhnms no longer are able to keep this Yahoo-like creature around, the novel ends darkly with Gulliver despising all human interaction and longing for the horse race. ""Yahoo"" is a term for a human being who is crude and boorish in all his desires.\n\nThe founders of Yahoo! have stated that the term they selected is an acronym for ""Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Object,"" since their fledgling Yahoo! project was just another one of those internet sites assimilating information into digital form."

If it was bought on e-bay, they have a proceedure that you can go through to try & get your money back & they will contact the seller as well.\n\nIf not through e-bay, I'd try E-mailing or calling the seller.  If they do not respond, contact your credit card company.  Once they see that you have tried to resolve the issue, they will get involved and will most likely credit your card right away.  \n\nGood luck!

Spot Advertising\nTelevision is without question a highly effective communications medium and through its dual audio/visual strengths helps stimulate sales more effectively than any other medium. Over 97% of UK households have a television, well over half own two sets and nearly 54% of the country's households currently have multichannel TV. \n\nEven with the development of techniques such as sponsorship, ad funded programming and advertorials, spot advertising still takes the lion's share of TV advertising revenue. Significant investment in creative work for TV commercials is due to research which shows that television offers the ultimate combination of sound, vision and movement to create the next best thing to having a salesman in the living room. Many brands have utilised the medium to great effect to create advertising which resonates with the public psyche, good examples are Levi's (Launderette), Guinness (Horses) and Hamlet (The mild cigar).
"Stars twinkle because of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. You can think as the atmosphere being made up of several ""layers."" Each layer has a different temperature and density. As the light from a star passes through the atmosphere, it is bent by each layer, and we perceive the twinkling. \n\nThe bending of the light when it passes from one medium to another, like water to air, or one layer of air to another, is called refraction. Refraction is what makes a straw look bent when you put it in a glass of water. Refraction also makes the stars and the Sun near the horizon look higher in the sky than they really are. In fact, when the Sun is setting, we are seeing the sun's disk when the Sun is already below the horizon!\n\nhttp://www.mira.org/fts0/stars/text/txt001c.htm"

Anything that you don't like to do or feel undervalued doing can be the worst. Many jobs have unpleasant conditions. There are nurses cleaning and diapering adults everyday, men and women cleaning cesspits, emptying porta-johns and garbage cans.\n\nHow about the well-dressed, highly paid advertising writer who would rather be a farmer? Going in to work each day for the prestige and the money but hating himself for doing it? He'd rather be out shoveling the stuff that other people are picking up. Promising himself that he'll do it when he retires but fearing that he won't live that long.\n\nThere are high prestige jobs and low prestige jobs, high pay and low pay, servile jobs and jobs that don't feel important. In the end it comes down to how each individual feels and what their values are.

You can't erase bad credit unless it is wrong. You need to wait for the usual 10 years for bankrupcy and 7 years for all other negative items on your report to drop. In the mean time, you should still use your credit cards, apply for loans, pay them on time and every time, keep your debt ratio low. This way, you can slowly repair and increase your credit but not erase.

my ideal job would be as a msw or masters in social work. in that capacity, i would like to work with at-risk-adolescents. why? because my daughter did some things when she was a teenager, that required the services of a sw, and i would like to help other adolescents, like she was helped. but also because of a bad experience with the first social worker she had, that had no compassion for anyone, and i figured i could be a better sw then he was, with no education. so far i got a b.a in that field and will soon start pursuing my masters.

You'll have to use one of the 3 credit agencies to get your score:\nExperian, Equifax and TransUnion.\nThe free credit report from the government doesn't include your score.\n\nI personally have used http://equifax.com/ several times to get my credit score and report.\n\nI would stay way from other sites claiming to give you your credit score...stick with the 3 known and credible firms. There are a lot of sites that offer you your credit score for free but I have no idea who they are. When you're entering private/sensitive information like your social security number, addresses, etc...you don't want to just give it out to any site.\n\nIf you have recently taking out a mortgage or auto loan, they should be able to tell you your score as well.
It all depends on the type of business you are going to start. \n\nWell first of all to start any business you need a fair amount of capital. Either you put in your own capital or take out a bank loan. Next, You should hire people to work for You (Again this depends on the type of business your going to start). Another important thing is the place where your gonna start your business. It should be placed in a strategic place so that when it comes to marketing your product you'll be on top. \n\nWell this is a really rough gudeline to starting a business. You have to look in to many other aspects before you can start a business.

"A lot of workers from rural areas travel to bigger manufacturing cities, providing a nearly inexhaustible source of cheap labor. The factories themselves are modern assembly lines. \n\nGenerally product development costs are not high since there is little new product development and most products are based on known, or copied, designs. China has been the most successful country is terms of ""duplicating"" other countries designs with almost comparably quality (although usually slightly inferior) at a lower cost basis."

The place can be as specific as a particular store or as general as outer space. 43 People contains the list of people you would like to meet. Each site allows you to keep a record of the accomplishments, trips, and meetings you have achieved. Your entries can be as frequently as you like. You can also add comments to other's entries.\n\nWhen you visit other people's lists, you can choose to send them a 'cheer'. When someone sends you a cheer, it shows that they are supporting you in that particular goal.\n\nThe sites provide the functionality of uploading photos, integrate with an existing Flickr account, and be able to cross post content to your own blog elsewhere."

There are varying opinions on the topic.\n\nSpiders and Snakes have the most venomous but you have to consider, not only the strength of venom, but the quanity delivered, the frequency of a human encountering a specific species, and the aggressiveness of the species. \n\nThat being said, the most dangerous snakes and spiders are almost all in Australia. The Taipan or Brown snakes and the Funnel Web Spider top out the lists generally.\n\nThe most forceful bite, although non venomous is the aligator snapping turtle. You can see this performed on National Geographic's Dangerous Encounters: Bite Force (look for a showing in the future). They showed this to be stronger than that of the Great White Shark a common misconception of the most forceful bite.

I used to be a big chess fan, but since I (re)discovered Go, chess seems like a waste of time.\n\nGo is a truly amazing game: it's one of the oldest in the world (about 4000 years), it's VERY easy to learn (takes less than 30 minutes), but it takes many years to reach a high level,\nand here's the kicker:\n\nAny moderately good amateur player (which you can become in about 1 or 2 years) can easily beat the best Go programs running on the fastest computers in the world!!\nSo it is one area where the human brain totally humiliates all the computing power in the world and the best algorithms that people designed so far!\n\nGo also has a handicap system, allowing players with different strenth to play against each other with equal chances. And most of all, Go is beautiful :)\n\nHere are some sites about Go:\nhttp://www.kiseido.com/\nhttp://senseis.xmp.net/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)
"Seattle is NOT an option if finances are an issue...rent is higher than in San Francisco, insurance premiums and auto registration are very high and the property, income and sales taxes are outrageous... Have you contemplated Oregon? Grants Pass, Medford and Eugene all meet the criteria of ""another friendly, laidback, artsy city not too expensive""\nAdd to that the beautiful climate and utterly stunning scenery....Property and income taxes are on the high side but Oregon does not have sales tax, so it balances out, auto registration is a bit lower than in Cali, and no smog certs required....socially, Oregon is very diverse, so whatever your politics and interests, you'll be able to find like minded folks."

"You could contact a logo company...you should be able to find one cheap in your area with a simple web search.  Make sure you specify that the logo be submitted in color in b&w (some logos which look great in one are barely readable in others).  Don't pick one that is too trendy, as it may look great now, but will look silly in 10 years.  And negotiate in advance to get the logo from the designer in a ""vector"" format for future use, as vector images are easily scalable to print large items like billboards, and also negotiate the rights for future use without royalties."

"Having traveled to Amsterdam about four times I can tell you the scoop.  Marijuana is legal however most people there try not to glamorize it so dont attempt to just pull a joint and smoke up in some of the bars and restaurants around Dam Square.  However they have cafe's  or they are called ""coffee shops""  Go in there, you can order green tea (most have no alcohol) and then ask for the weed menu.  On this menu it gives you the rundown on all the varieties they sell at the bar.  Some bars even have a small sample attached so you can smell it.  When you decide what you want just order it.  You can walk the streets while smoking a joint, just dont go puffing into businesses like grocery stores to the front desk of the hotel.  Imagine you live in a society where nobody can smoke indoors (imagine you live in California) just dont smoke inside.  However I smoked a lot in the hotel.  \n\nMushrooms... sorry they closed the shops just this year.  You cant get dry mushrooms anymore, however ask about wet mushrooms, but I believe they went away too.  \n\nCrack, coke, lsd, the worx.  You can get them in dam square just hang around the statues at night, you will see dirty looking people, they can get you pretty much everything.  Just dont eat the stuff out of thier bottle.  I think its dirty dirty meth...  I just guessed, but im not into the hard hard stuff.  just and FYI..."

"Well, different for girls & guys. It is a hard one to answer not knowing your gender. Still, I'll give it a shot as I've asked my husband questions before to find out what it feels like to him.\n\nFor the girl, it can be painful the first time or two, depending upon the size of the male as well as the internal size of the female. The good part for the female is that, believe it or not, you ""adjust"" somewhat in size to be able to handle it.\n\nFor the guy, it can be rather stressful because he feels like he can ""go off"" at any second &, of course, if he does, it sort of shortens the enjoyment for both parties involved. From what I've been told, there is a sort of pressure that is felt as things build up. Any guy out there who would like to clarify more is welcome to do so :)\n\nFor both parties involved - especially if both are virgins - there will be a lot of times where things feel ticklish or just plain odd...like it feels good but there's just something different about it. Just roll with it & let yourself ""feel"" the feelings that happen because this is one of the best parts. For a woman who might not actually climax during the act, this might be THE best part so, if you are a guy, keep that in mind. If she's enjoying what you are doing, spend a few more minutes there before moving on. Anyway, overall, it quite honestly feels strange & wonderful all at the same time.\n\nNow, I will say this just to be full in my answer. There are times that it take forever for either to reach a climax & sometimes one or the other doesn't. These are the times where you must remember that practice makes perfect.\n\nAnd, again, be careful & protect yourself, please. That in mind, have fun..."

VUL is not worth it.  Life insurance is not meant to be an investment tool.  Though, often cash value is the enticing aspect in the eyes of the consumer, insurance should be bought for protection.  VUL is often outperformed by Universal Life and basic Whole Life because of the higher administration costs, lack of investment options, and bad market performance.\n\nThe admin costs for VUL are more costly because every time someone touches a piece of paper in the insurance business there's a charge associated with it (ie, paying quarterly is more costly than paying annually because of the admin costs of receiving 3 more payments).  With VUL there is much more paper being processed, and more parties involved.\n\nYou have more options for investment within IRA's, or general investment accounts, so why not purchase insurance for insurance and investments for investments.  Too often, VUL policies lapse due to underfunding caused by bad performance or an agent's inflated illustration (ie, 10-14% returns), thus leaving the individual without coverage and needing to repurchase insurance at a higher rate due to their increased age.\n\nIsn't the purpose of buying insurance to eliminate risk?  VUL just adds a new form of risk into the equation.  If the lower price is the incentive, go with UL.  If you can afford it, go with Whole life.  It is the grandfather of the life insurance business and more money comes out of pocket, but the stability, guaranteed return and peace of mind is worth it.

Dear friend, a man named JOB asked the same question, a very long time ago. This man had a perfect life,a beautiful family and lots of sheep (wealth). However, JOB was selected by GOD to be tested by SATAN to see if he could endure the woes,\nand sorrows of losing his own family,his livestock and everything that he owned. So when this happened ,JOB was very bitter and sad becuse he thought he was cursed by GOD himself. However, has time passed GOD spoke to JOB in the form of a whirlwind and JOB finally saw just how special he was in GOD's eye after GOD demanded a plea from JOB.\nYou see, GOD demands respect from us but above all,\nGOD does'nt want us to be PRIDEFUL idiots. My fiend you are not the worst person in the entire world, you are my own flesh and blood pleading for justice.

"If you are looking to start over and you have the financial flexibility, consider taking out a student loan and going back to school. That will give you some time to get on your feet, and it can be much easier to transition into a new field if you have some defined credentials.\n\nAlternatively, if you are willing to take risks and have a good idea, this might be a good time to start a new business.\n\nThere are lots of good fields to enter, anything from nursing to computer programming to molecular biology. Mostly, it depends on what you like to do and what you are good at.\n\nSpend some time thinking about what you wish you could spend your time doing. Is it working with people? Analyzing data? Working with your hands? Writing? Traveling? As long as it's not ""sitting around watching TV"" or something (and really, most of us would get bored pretty quickly with that), there should be a number of potential careers that allow you to do that.\n\nMost importantly, no career, no matter how lucrative, is the right career for you if you don't enjoy doing it."

"Two strategies:  1) cut your spending, and 2) reorganize your debt.\n\n1) Try to figure out the LEAST amount you can spend, and still live.  Eliminate all fees (ATM, long distance, late fees, etc).  Cancel any frills until you are debt free (got a land line AND a cell phone?  Cancel one.  Cancel cable - you'll be amazed at the deals they will offer you to come back!)  Eat in.  Don't spend a penny on Soda/candy from a machine or coffee from a trendy coffee-bar.\n\n2)  list your debt in order, highest interest rate to lowest.  Your strategy is to eliminate the highest ones, either by moving the debt down to lower rates, or by paying it off.  \n\nI disagree with the previous answer (not to pay off credit card debt with an equity line).  Of course, this should be done with care, but this is one of the best strategies - secured debt (like an equity line) is almost always cheaper interest rate than unsecured debt (like credit cards).  ""You could lose your house"", yes, if you are stupid or not careful.  But you can also eliminate debt much quicker!  \n\nShop every rate that you have.  If you have an Equity line at Prime + 2, Shop it.  You may be able to get a Home Equity line at Prime - .75 (I just did).\n\nI believe that it's to my advantage to have debt and savings.  Low interest, tax-saving debt can be a good thing (like my Home Equity Line).  High interest debt and fees are for somebody besides me."
"I feel that you should first look at what you really want to do and what industry/field you'd want to be in.

Once you realize that, you'd start finding enough and more avenues in that field for sure.\n\nOn the other side, some of the ""evergreen"" industries you might want to  look at, after your Business administration degree (if you are interested) are\n-Bio tech\n-advertising"

Start with a well written press release. http://www.prfree.com/ The $300 video is well worth the cost with a positive ROI. ValPak coupons are a great way to reach local consumers for a printing company. http://www.valpak.com/  You can also provide free service giveaways to get some great radio advertisements free of charge. Open a website and have it designed to capture local traffic. You're in a wickedly competitive market but you can differentiate to get the customer's attention. Who is your primary target, business or consumers? Are you able to provide services for other than local clients?
(Radio)\nIf the product is new, you must say the name, i.e. product, website, person, (whatever you want the customer to remember) an incredibly annoying amount of times for the first couple of weeks, then you can be more generous to the potential consumer.  \n\n(TV)\nI feel that funny commercials are the best way for me to remember a product.

Now after soooo many disappointments I´m using Data Entry Pro and it´s now making me money (finally!) online. \n\nAnyway, basically you sign up with them and then once your logged in you just fill in as many forms as you like in their members section and you get paid for each one. I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $250-$350. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra income stream aswell as my full time job so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepared to spend a little money though if you want to do anything online like this but it´s already been worth it for me.\n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nDave"

Ahlawat is a clan or gotra of Jats found in Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh in India. It is drived from Illa-Vrta . Illa-Vrta was a province in Jambudvipa, which was situated in Mongolia. Presently it is known as Altai that is degenerated form of Illa-Vrta. Illa-Vrta varsa (Meruvarsa) is the mountainous region around the central point of Meru. It probably includes Pamirs, Badakshan, parts of Kashmir, North-West Frontier region and north-east Afghanistan etc.

"If you mean ""treat"" as in pay for dinner or something - as opposed to giving your kid or dog a treat :) - this is the best way I've ever seen:\n\nCourtesy of a friend of mine, I have learned that the easiest way to treat for dinner & not get an arguement of discussion (in most cases) is to inform the server at the beginning of the meal, when ordering. It can be done quietly & with no fanfare - my friend tends to make as if asking a question about the menu & telling the waitstaff at that time - or you can simply precede your order with, ""And I'll be paying tonight."" Another approach is to inform the waitstaff who shows you to your table or to excuse yourself for the restroom & tell the server while you are away. In most of these situations it is an easy thing to do even if other people are around.\n\nAnother thing my friend does is that he will normally jump in to order first when he's decided that he's treating us. It can be quite funny to watch he & my husband if they've both decided to treat on the same night. One server brought the house down one evening when, as they were beginning to discuss the pay issue, she said; ""Why don't you just split the bill & be done with it?"""

"Most people have experienced the dreaded ice cream headache at some point. You are minding your own business on a hot summer day, eating something like an ice cream cone, a milk shake, a Slurpee, a snow cone... Then, suddenly you are hit with the most excruciating headache! Fortunately it only lasts about 30 seconds. \n\nSo where does this headache come from? \n\nI have not seen a better answer to the question than in this article by Joseph Hulihan. It's a little technical, but it contains some great information. Here's a summary: When something cold touches the roof of your mouth on a hot day, it triggers a cold headache. The cause is a dilation of blood vessels in the head. The dilation may be caused by a nerve center located above the roof of your mouth -- when this nerve center gets cold, it seems to over-react and tries to heat your brain. \n\nTherefore, the easy way to avoid ""brain freeze"" is to keep cold things away from the roof of your mouth!"

This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?

yes, soda is bad for you, but that doesn't stop most americans from drinking it.  Even diet soda is bad for you due to the carbonation, which causes bloating and gas and reduces calcium absorbtion thereby contributing to low bone density in some individuals, and the phenylketonurics (containing phenylalanine)used in the manufacture of some artificial sweeteners.

They have an excellent resource for free and also recommend some other websites such as the Small Business Association.  The best advice I got when researching different franchises was to call and speak with as many current franchise owners as well as those that have left the franchise.  I was at the end of a 4-month process with a franchise, very close to sending my deposit, when I spoke with an owner that changed my mind.  I had spoken with over 20 owners and this person made it all clear.  Point is, this franchise was ranked in the top 100 of Entrepreneur Magazines Franchises and my personal research saved me from making a huge mistake.\n\nGood luck!
Patience is a virtue...\nIf at first you don't succeed, try, try again...\n\nA pair of platitudes that may help you in the future.  Sometimes it takes time to find the best answer.  You often have to wade through sites and pages that really don't address your question.  And sometimes you have to just try a different approach.\n\nAnd of course, when all else fails, there's all these great geniuses at Yahoo! Answers. :-)

I think it may have been a valid reason to the person that complained and Customer Care, if not to you. The reason why is no one else had the background info that you did in your mind; you knew they where all singers and that by listing 3 similar people you where attempting to indicate a comparison, but this is VERY vague to someone who doesnt know what you where thinking when you wrote it. Three names; who the heck are these people? Question mark; what does he want to know??? \n\nNo offence, but I am sure I would have reported it as not a question or at least posted a response asking you to elaborate as well. The way to avoid this type of response from others it to take the time to ask a full question with detail...think of a quiz for school where they simply list three  names of historic figures followed by a question mark...would you know that your teacher wanted you to compare their effect on the civilized world as it is today, with no other information, or would you fail miserably? My point is, do as you did with this question; fill the reader in on all the important parts they need to come up with a good answer for you. Read it again before you post it to see if it will make sense to others.\n\nHope this helps to clarify the situation. Good luck with all your future questions!

If you believe in Jesus, and have faith that he died on the cross for your sins. And ask him to come into your heart and forgive you for your sins. He will forgive you and accept you as his child. Then when you die, if you die before the Lord comes back, you will go to heaven and live with him. This is where others will be living happily and you can enjoy it with them and serve the Lord.\n\nThe other way would be going to Hell when you die. And this way is the opposite of choosing God. If you deny him, and don't believe in him, and never ask him to come into your heart, you will go to Hell and burn eternally.\n\nAnd This is the truth. You can read it in the Bible for yourself if you wish. A King James Version Bible. This is the one that they wrote over 2000 plus years ago.

"Kamikaze (神風) is a Japanese word, usually translated as ""divine wind"" — which came into being as the name of a legendary typhoon said to have saved Japan from a Mongol invasion fleet in 1281. In Japanese, the word kamikaze is usually used only for this typhoon. In the English language, kamikaze usually refers to suicide attacks carried out by Japanese aircrews against Allied shipping towards the end of the Pacific campaign of World War II."

You will find you are in high demand. In Nigeria you can choose from Shell, Total, Chevron, Exxon, and many others. Most of them will be willing to give you additional training, and all of the multinationals are seeking to increase their employment of Nigerian nationals. You may also discover that the pay scale in the oil industry is higher than other industry, and that you will sometimes have the opportunity for world travel.  \n\nI suggest going to the website of any oil company you are interested in and applying. I know Shell and Chevron have this capacity. You might also do well simply by going to their local office and either speaking to the HR department or an engineering manager. Good luck. I will be looking forward to your contribution to the industry.\n\nBy the way, there are fraud operations out there that promise jobs in the oil industry- please don't pay anyone to help you get a job. It isn't necessary.
"Generally, yes.  There are exceptions though.\n\nOne of the principles behind capitalism is that buyers and sellers are able to freely make decisions about whether to buy or sell, and at what price.  If a seller raises his price, buyers should be able to buy less, or buy from someone else.\n\nIf a company has a monopoly, then the buyers have no choice about where to buy.  So there are laws and regulations about how monopolies can behave.  Examples of monopolies include power companies, and cable companies.\n\nSometimes in natural disasters, some sellers take advantage of the situation to raise prices of things like gas or water by huge amounts.  While some may argue that this is the principle of free markets, others feel that this is unfair to disaster victims who have no other options.  So there are ""price gouging"" laws in some places that forbid this kind of thing.\n\nAnd then there's price fixing, which means communicating with your competitors and raising prices together.  Again, this is seen as unfair, and so is illegal.  Some of the airlines were guilty of this a long time ago.\n\nThere are some other minor restrictions on pricing, but for the most part, aside from doing these things that are considered grossly unfair, businesses are generally free to price however they want."
Love is real, but that doesn't mean everyone will find their true love.
God isn't cruel to poor people.  Rich people are cruel to poor people, so they can remain rich.  If they share the wealth and intelligence with the peasants, they'll have to share the gold too.  The world has plenty of resources so there should be no poor people, that's not Gods fault.  Stop blaming God for everything, that's a copout.
The trick to making something disappear is that it can only be done for people standing in a certain spot, it involves perspective and mirrors. I don't know any more than this, I saw a programme where a magician did these tricks but only teased with how it was done. There is always a trick to magic, but they are carefully guarded.

A lot depends on what state you live in. Most state have laws about anyone under 18 & work. Also, many states will require a work permit.

A patent is the protection of the implementation of an idea; so you can protect a thing, the artistic design of a thing, a human-designed plant, or a process.\n\nA copyright protects a unique writing, like a book, poem, or short story.\n\nWhere things get fuzzy is where the idea is the writing, like a computer program. You can (and want to) do both, because you want to protect the idea so no one can change it slightly and sell it, as well as the actual source so that the actual code is protected.

What is the best stock is a question subject to great uncertainty. In other words, it is sort of like betting on a horse prior to a horse race. Certain companies sell at higher price to earnings ratios than others. These are the 2-1 bets.  Other stocks have low price to earnings ratios. These are the 20-1 long shots. The market at any time tends to price each stock in relation to its earnings potential, its dividend, and other factors.  If the market were 100% efficient, then all stocks would be equally good. There is a good deal of rational for this reasoning. One rational is that the vast majority of mutual funds-75%--tend to underperform the average stock. Some of their underperformance is due to their expenses. Some is due to the fact that no matter what they buy, it will tend not to perform any bettern than the market in general. \n\nAs a result many mutual funds and exchange traded funds have come to market that try to match the market in general. In other words they have thrown in the towel in trying to pick the best stocks.  \n\nBut!!!  Mutual funds have to invest a LOT of money billions of dollars.  With that much money to invest they have a problem.  They just can not find a good stock and dump a billion dollars into it.  \n\nSince you do not have a billion to invest (my assumption based on the fact that if you did you would not be asking this question here) you may be able to beat the market.  Some do and some do not. \n\nI have no idea what the best stock is? I doubt that whoever you asked would have any idea. \n\nHere are a couple of suggestions though.\n\nDo you think that more easy oil will be discovered? If the answer is no, you might consider an oil stock. Another advantage of owning an oil stock is that when the price at the pump goes up 25 cents you won't feel so bad. \n\nDo you think that we are at the top of a housing bubble similar to the internet bubble?  If the answer is yes, you may want to avoid the stock market all together and put you dinero into T-bills. \n\nDo you think that there will be more and more old people? If the answer is yes, you may want to buy some health care stock.
Generally with collectable items, you don't really want to clean them.  You might want to discuss this with a coin collector or collector's shop before you decide to do anything to your coins.  Often, with very old things, being dirty doesn't make them less valuable.

Your question is a tough one as it appears you are attemting to see how one can increase home ownership in a changing market due to demand.\n\nThis is a problem throuhout America, where its an honor to find decent affordbale housing.\n\nMany communities and governments are working with Grant Money, zoning ordinances to improve the existing housing inventory.\n\nIf the busineess climate is improving, I would suggest there are opportunities for those who may have skills such as landscaping, masonary, small resturants and those who are moving to the area may need.\n\nReal Estate will also be in demand and those in the community may need to improve there level of skills with the change, thus creating a level of economics that will support the purchasing of a home.\n\nI just looked at Realtor.com and found multiple properties under $150,000, opportunities do exist.

In a standard mortgage your payments consist of a combination of interest and principal payments.  There are other mortgages/loans that are interest only payments.  And then there are horrible mortgages that you are actually paying less than interest payments.  This means that the principal is growing.

"Well first of all, that is not a question, it is a statement.  Yet I am going to assume that you are trying to say ""How can you save money?"" and will answer that question.  I'm sure you have heard of saving 10% of every paycheck and put it into long-term saings.  This is the most important concept in investing and savings.  Yet for most people it is impossible to find space in their budgets.  The only way for many people that this works is to put the money directly into a CD (certificate of deposit - a type of bank account).  This way it is not at all tempting to spend it when you get it.  There is a way to get this done automaticaly, yet I don't really know how (I am 15).  \n\nAll of this is explained in the book ""The Wealthy Barber"" by David Chilton.  If you were to only read one book in your life, this one is the one you should read.  It goes through basic savings and investment skills while putting it in a way that is entertaining and simple to understand.  Everyone should read this book and everyone can accieve a happy retirement if they follow the advice put forth by Dave.  It is amazing how simple the suggestions that he says are to implement."
When faced with a decision like this, go with whichever choice has the least worst outcome.\n\nIn this case, if you chat her up but are refused you may feel embarrassed or hurt but those feelings will go away in time. On the other hand, if you don't turn on your charm, you may miss the opportunity of finding a fantastic partner.\n\nFor me, not taking action and then constantly regretting it is worse than embarrassment.  Go for it and at least you can be proud you gave it your best shot.

I wish I could say that I'm equally versed in all of them, but to tell you the truth I'm more of a 'jack of all trades'. I love to dabble with anything that catches my interest and always strive to try something new to expand my knowledge and understanding (and, of course, trying to have as much fun as possible along the way). \n\nMy background is fairly varied and straddles both development and design: I did two years of Computer Sciences (at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich), but found it far too academic and uninspiring. After working as an assistant for a professional photographer for a few months, I upped sticks, moved to the UK, and switched to a Graphic Design course, followed by a Masters in Creative Technology. \n\nIf I had to choose one of the areas that I'm most comfortable working in, I'd have to settle for photography. I've been shooting since I was about 16 years old, and I have, in the last few years, also started collecting older cameras (I've nearly completed my collection of all of Canon's A and F series). Despite my other interests in digital technology, I still prefer to use real film - mostly black and white. There is a certain quality to the analogue medium (such as black and white film's response to light, and the very natural looking grain you get at 400 ASA and above) and the 'craft' involved in manual shooting and working around film's limitations that I'm passionate about.

"I listened to DC Talk, Audio Adrenaline and Jars of Clay when I was a teen.

Time zones are a way of organizing time so that people living in a large area (country, part of continent) share the same time, just to make things easy. People living at about the same longitude usually have about the same local time. There are 25 standard time zones around the world, these are all an integer offset of hours to UTC-time, for example, +5 hours or -10 hours to UTC. If UTC-time is 12:00 (Noon/PM), then people having offset +5 hours, have local time 17:00 (or 5:00 PM).\nThen... there are some countries/places not using the standard time zones, they might be 5 hours and 45 minutes ahead of UTC, like Kathmandu is or some other non-integer offset of hours.

If you have another job lined un it could be a good reason to leave a job if they are or will be overloading you with work.  \n\nIf you do not have another job lined up this may be an actual opportunity.  It is actually a good sign that your boss is telling you his expectations(even if they seem unreasonable).  Think about things that could make your job easier and/or better.  Now is a great time to ask for them.  For example you might tell your boss, because the workload will increase, if I can work from home for a couple of days a week I will be better able to avoid the office distractions and be more productive.

13yo's usually have plenty of ambition to develop their minds, and have plenty of energy too at that age. Programming is very satisfying, it is sorta like building something. You develop part of the code and see it working. Later you develop more, and see how what you already developed is part of the whole piece! :)\nHere is a couple websites about programming! \nhttp://www.programmingtutorials.com/\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming
It's possible, but very, very rare. Most spider wouldn't be crawling on a bed, as most house spiders like the floor (especially places that aren't disturbed very often, like the basement). Spiders also don't like to walk on moisture or in windy places. So they wouldn't be likely to go into a mouth with moisture and breathing. One other thing is that even when people are asleep, I don't know how easy it would be to swallow a spider that doesn't want to be swallowed.
Generally, business has to innovate. That's where the differentiators are established--and if you don't have an edge, then you don't have a viable model for sustaining growth.\n\nIteration may play a lead role in their R&D process, but markets are so flexible and fluid that true market share, and loyalty will be captured by the innovators for the longer horizon.

Forget about what your friend wants do whats best for YOU. \n\nYou probably don't want to hear this but honesty is the best policy.

No planet other than Earth has been positively shown to have life on it yet.  Other places in our solar system have conditions that are comparable to conditions in harsh environments on Earth.  These harsh Earth environments do contain a variety of simple life forms, such as hot vents on the ocean floors, antarctica, etc.  This makes planetary scientists think that it is likely that simple organisms will be found elsewhere in the solar system soon.\n\nThe short answer: Almost, but not quite yet!
"Bet I know what happened to you.\n\nIf what you want to know is if police officers have the right to gather evidence, yes...they do.  An abnormal pulse (high or low) can be evidence of drug or alcohol use (more likely drug) and as such, the police are allowed to obtain that information.\n\nYou don't have the right to remain silent and not have your pulse taken because your speech isn't the issue...it's the physical state of your body that's being ""questioned"" and your body does not have the right to remain silent, only your mouth.\n\nVery educated and reasonable people are likely to disagree with me on this.  Doesn't make them right or wrong, just makes them defense lawyers most likely.\n\nThere is no specific statute that says you must submit to a pulse measurement (like there is for DUI, where there's a specific statute that requires you to submit to a chemical test).  However, the police do have a right to gather evidence.\n\nI'm sorry that you were left having to ask this question.  Sounds like it was not explained to you very well (did you ask?).\n\nYou're welcome to write me at my user name at yahoo.com if you have more questions about this (and really, it's not like I'm going to try and find out who/where you are...worst case, somebody got arrested for being high and that's a dime a dozen...I would be more interested in you getting the answers you're looking for and maybe some information about where to find out more)."

A good example is when you buy a new car battery.  Maybe for one whole year if that battery goes bad, they will replace it free. After the year, if the battery goes bad you will not get a free replacement but will get maybe 75% of the price of your battery. The longer you have the battery the less the replacement sum will be. It is prorated according to how long you have had the use of the battery versus how much more use you are guaranteed. A five year battery that goes bad in the first year will be prorated to give you a free battery or a pretty big portion of the cost of that battery. A five year battery that fails in the fourth year will be prorated according to the fact that this is a four year old battery with one more year of warranty. You might just get 25% of the value of a new battery.
Me neither. I can find it on the map though.

Reading ur question n thinking abt u.
"Early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practiced by Babylonian traders as long ago as the 2nd millennium BCE. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code of Hammurabi, c. 1750 BC and practiced by early Mediterranean sailing merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.\n\nA thousand years later, the inhabitants of Rhodes invented the concept of the 'general average'. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 AD when they organized guilds called ""benevolent societies"" which acted to care for the families and funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the Middle Ages served a similar purpose. The Talmud deals with several aspects of insuring goods.\n\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in post-Renaissance Europe, and specialized varieties developed.\n\nToward the end of the seventeenth century, the growing importance of London as a centre for trade led to rising demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Mr Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house which became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants and ships’ captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news. It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, Lloyds of London remains the leading market for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it works rather differently to the more familiar kinds of insurance. (See Lloyd's of London).\n\nInsurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured 13,200 houses. In the aftermath of this disaster Nicholas Barbon opened an office to insure buildings. In 1680 he established England's first fire insurance company, ""The Fire Office"", to insure brick and frame homes.\n\nThe first insurance company in the United States provided fire insurance and was formed in Charles Town (modern-day Charleston), South Carolina, in 1732.\n\nBenjamin Franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly against fire in the form of perpetual insurance. In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses.\n\nIn the United States, regulation of the insurance industry is highly Balkanized, with primary responsibility assumed by individual State insurance departments. Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally, State insurance commissioners operate individually, though at times in concert through a national insurance commissioner's organization. In recent years, some have called for a federal regulatory system for insurance similar to that of the banking industry.\n\nIn the State of New York, which has unique laws in keeping with its stature as a global business center, attorney general Eliot Spitzer has been in a unique position to grapple with major national insurance brokerages. Spitzer alleged that Marsh & McLennan steered business to insurance carriers based on the amount of contingent commissions that could be extracted from carriers, rather than basing decisions on whether carriers had the best deals for clients. Several of the largest commercial insurance brokerages have since stopped accepting contingent commissions and have adopted new business models."

"The thought of a belly button falls under the human term. When a child is born he/she has their naval cord tied which creates a ""belly button"". All animals have a place where there once was an umbilical cord. And Bears are no exception. But when a bears umbilical cord falls off the hair will fall in a swirl at what is their naval. But as for a Belly Button.. No only us as human have the Belly Button because our umbilical cord is tied off and made into one."
There are some lenders who now will finance a person with no bankruptsy seasoning. You will pay a much higher rate but after a year as long as you make all your payments on time you should be able to re-finance and recieve a lower rate. Be careful of large pre-payment penalties and large closing costs lenders tend to take atvantage of persons in a desparate situation. The best way to handle this situation is to re-establish your credit and not overextend yourself. There are several ways to re-estblish your credit in a short ammount of time.

I depends on many factors. Your location and industry are 2 primary factors. Also, experience, education level, size of the organization, and number of people you manage play a role. Experience is an important part of this question because you obviously (although, I've seen it happen) won't became a manager right away. \n\nIn Chicago, I would say that a new HR Manager with a BA degree and 3 years experience working in HR previously could earn $35,000 to $50,000 a year. The range is huge because...well...you'll learn that once you get into HR.

Taj-ul-Masaajid: (The name is Masaajid and not masjid because 'masaajid' is plural of mosques and it literally means Crown Among Mosques) It is one of the largest mosques in Asia, built by Shahjehan Begum around a courtyard with a large tank in the centre and with an imposing double storeyed gate-way with 4 recessed archways and 9 imposing cusped multifoiled openings in the main prayer hall. The Quibla wall in the prayer hall is carved with 11 recessed arches, while the mimber is made of black basalt. The structure is enlivened by the limpid expanse of water in the tank outside the northern wall. The monumentality of this structure was much greater originally when it faced the towering bastions of the Fatehgarh Fort. A three-day Ijtima congregation was held here annually draws people from all over the world but has recently been shifted outside the City. Bhopal has over 400 mosques. Interestingly, Tajul Masaajid, perhaps the biggest mosque in India, faces the smallest mosque in the country that lies just on the other side of the road in the same area. The Dhai Seedhi Masjid (2-1/2 stairs mosque) was built in early 18th century when a rampart was converted into mosque.

First of all what you need to do is go get yourself pre-approved for a mortgage!!!  That should have been the very first step before you even started looking at condos. I'm surprised any lenders would accept such a deposit without approving you completely for the loan!\n\nNext, 680 is fairly average for a credit score (not great, but definitely not bad). They will mainly take that score into consideration for your interest rate (which could really only fluctuate about .3 percent). Income level is good, but considering the cost of the condo, combined with other expenses (car payments, insurance, taxes, credit cards, any other loans or pre-existing monthly bills), I could say with confidence that 15 year mortgage is NOT the way to go. \n\nThey won't take the rent for the other bedrooms into consideration, unless you have a lease signed by tenants, and the income is GUARANTEED to come in.

If you want a national plan (in the event you do a significant amount of travel) then you might want to use Blue Cross or Medica.  I would suggest looking at a plan that has a deductible that is at least $1,500 for a single person or $3,000 for a family.  This will keep the premium costs lower and also qualify you for contributions into an HSA (Health Savings Account).  These contributions are pre-tax and can be withdrawn and used tax free for qualified medical expenses.  \nThis type of strategy saves you premium costs and taxes.  If you or a family member who will be on the plan has a large amount of health care expenses per year, you might do better to consider a lower deductible.  The increased premiums might be less expensive than the out of pocket expenses if you are more likely to use more services or ongoing prescription medications that are expensive.

I am grateful that I have such wonderful parents.  They may have been very strict when I was younger (making sure I didn't do drugs, hang out with the wrong crowd or drop out of school).  I am now 23 years old, I have graduated from college, I work a full time and I am getting ready to go back to school for my Masters.  I always thought my parents were ruining my childhood but now I am so thankful.  I know my parents wish they could have helped me pay for college or help me with my bills but I am so happy I grew up the way I did and I would never change my parents for anyone or anything in this whole world!

"Emmanuel ""Manny"" D. Pacquiao (born December 17, 1978), aka ""Pacman"" and ""The Destroyer"" is the reigning WBC International Super Featherweight Champion (2005–present), former RING People's Featherweight Champion (2003 to 2005), former IBF Super Bantamweight Champion (2001 to 2004), and former WBC Flyweight Champion (1998 to 1999). He has a record of 41 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws, with 34 wins coming by way of knockout.\n\n[edit]\nBiography\nPacquiao was born in the province of Bukidnon in the Philippines. It is not certain whether he started selling bread called ""pan de sal"" on the streets or made it as a bread maker or a ""panadero"" who makes different kinds of breads including the ""pan de sal"". There are news items that link him to being cocky in bars, starting fights but that part of his personality may have faded as evident of his closeness to God (as a Catholic) on recent interviews as well as his religious gestures before and after a fight.\n\n[edit]\nCareer\nThe boxer, who hails from General Santos City, Philippines is also dubbed ""The Destroyer"" by his peers in the boxing world. He has ended many of his fights with his left punch.\n\nThe 27-year-old Pacquiao started his professional boxing career in 1995 at 106 pounds. He bounced in weight from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th fight against Rustico Torrecampo via third round technical knockout. Shortly after the Torrecampo fight Pacquiao settled in at 112 pounds, winning the WBC Flyweight title only to lose it in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat by third round knockout. Theoretically speaking, Pacquiao may have lost the belt at the scales by not being able to make weight of 112 lb (51 kg).\n\nFollowing the loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao again jumped in weight, this time stopping at the Super Bantamweight division of 122 lb (55 kg) where he picked up the WBC International title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came. Pacquiao’s big break came on June 23rd, 2001, against IBF Super Bantamweight champion Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and walked out of the fight the newly crowned IBF Super Bantamweight champion. Pacquiao scored three knockdowns before the end of the fight was called in the fifth round.\n\n \nPacquiao wobbles Erik Morales.Manny went on to defend his title four times before the match that many consider to have defined his career, against his childhood boxing idol, Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico came. Pacquiao rose from an official knockdown in the first round, and won the fight by technical knockout, when Barrera’s corner stopped the fight in the eleventh round. With this victory, the ""Pacman"" captured the WBO and Ring Magazine People's Featherweight Title, as Barrera had beaten Naseem Hamed previously for that belt. Pacquiao's performance established himself, according to many critics, fans and boxing magazines alike, as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, and put the Philippines on the boxing world's map again where he follows in the\nfootsteps of past Filipino boxing stars such as ""Flash Elorde"", Ben Villaflor, and\nPancho Villa, among others.\n\n \nPacquiao knocks down Erik Morales.Only six months removed from his win over Marco Antonio Barrera, Pacquiao went on to challenge another respected Mexican boxer, Juan Manuel Marquez, holder of the WBA and IBF Featherweight Title. Experts predicted that Marquez, a dangerous counter-puncher, would prevail over Pacquiao because of his apparently superior boxing skills. The fight turned out to be one of the greatest Featherweight clashes in the history of boxing. Pacquiao's handspeed and punching power was displayed early as he stormed Marquez with jabs and straight lefts that sent the Mexican Champion to the canvas three times in the first round alone. It looked as if Pacquiao was on his way to "

There are an infinite number of personal views, philospohies, beliefs on why we exist, what purpose does it serve, why does the universe exist.

I would say the obligations of a guardian are the same as a parent.  Safeguard the child and provide for their basic needs.

Well, the working week has decreased dramatically over the past century.  In 1906, a 16 hour day was considered normal, and our consumer culture hadn't evolved to have anything resembling a weekend.  The reason we don't see even shorted periods is because our technology allows us to do more work in less time, meaning that 8 hours today can achieve, hypothetically speaking, 10 hours of work from the past. If we cut the number of hours, we would be loosing out on overall productivity.  Some can blame this on greed of 'the corporations', but if you step off the soap box and take an objective look at our marvelously complex, comfortable and highly advanced society, you'll see that many of the things you take for granted simply would not exist if economic productivity decreased in such a way.
This is the application of two stage dividend discount model.\n\nDiscount the dividend received at the cap rate for the first 5 years.  Dividend grows at 6.17% (1.005^12-1).  It would be $21.77\n\nThe second stage is 100% payout of earnings.  Assuming earnings grow at the same rate, the Year 6 earnings would be  $12.70 at which point, it is an instrument paying perpetual dividend at the same rate.  At the cap rate, that means the price at Year 5 is $141.17 (12.70/0.09) which when discounted at 9% is $91.75 (141.17/(1.09^5)).\n\nAdd these two values to get the stock price = 91.75 + 21.77 = 113.52

Hi Gharsha,\n\nMy experience throughout group discussions is that you should demonstrate actively your mentality but with correctness and intelligence. Indeed, being relaxed and confident helps a lot, but not to the point they perceive you may be too comfortable or even arrogant. Yes, perceptions count and often they buy-in the wrong ones! \n\nWhen it comes to a personal interview is easier because you don’t have to compete, only to be honest and give the interviewer as much useful info as you can. Some questions are surprisingly ambiguous, e.g.: “talk me about you”. Don’t panic! You have to follow a coherent line, so sometimes is good for you to require a more specific question –keeping your nice smile-: “Oh, yes…like about how I look at myself? Or about my family? About my past, student experience? About my latest work experience?” Obviously the answers are free, but being a little bit more specific info helps you not to panic (and getting your mind in blank!). \n\nI guess the most difficult part comes when they ask you to talk about “future”. Great businessmen have warned me you’ve just to tell companies what they expect to listen. If you plan to study a master or doctorate in France within 2 years, probably they won’t hire someone who will quit the company in an early future, so don’t say it!!! You dream to work in that company, and you’ll be there the rest of your life working for them –that’s what they expect to listen. Despite the prior, make it clear you’re a person with ambitions and not mediocre –just keep your aces under your sleeves, gotcha?- They hire what they need, and… believe me, when you’re not useful to them anymore, it’d be real strange if they don’t fire you. For me, too, that’s a tough point, but hey, it’s globalization, and nowadays loyalty doesn’t exist at all, likely a multi-national company just buy a little company and then everybody’s out. \n\nAdditionally, is always interesting to ask about the performance, growing, development, career opportunities and: THE GOLDEN RULE: The salary and benefits package, always, always are discussed at the end of interviews or negotiations, don’t even mention it if they don’t touch that issue, wait at the end –when they seem to be so interested on you-. If the company is real good and you really project yourself staying there some time, you can always sacrifice a little money, exchanging it for experience, vitae, training or relationships in order to escalate to better positions-in that company or any other one-.\n\nI hope those tips helped you. Please pardon my English mistakes, but Spanish, Catalan and French really mix my mind up!\n\nGood luck, and tell me if you succeed!\n\nAlfonso

"The psychology of the matter is this. Because when people are on the internet, there is no face to face communication. They can remain as anonymous as they desire. Hence such persons feel none of the inhibitions that are normally imposed by society on what is considered proper etiquette in conversation. Besides receiving rude words in return, there is no fear of severe consequences such as getting their face busted, nor do they have to see the facial expressions of the hurt they cause. Most people like this have poorly developed social skills to begin with. Either they are boorish cads, and their behavior is amplified by the nature of the internet, or they have pent-up anger that they are afraid to display in public, and lash out on the internet. People like this need to be dealt with firmly, but as the Scriptures say, ""answer a fool according to his folly, answer not a fool according to his folly."" In other words, expose such people as they fools they are, without resorting to their their tactics."

That is why you should get a realator.  It might feel like you are paying a lot up front, but in the long run, you will save money.  To find out what you can afford take your rent and compare it to what you would pay for mortgage + taxes + repairs.  Now you have to look at the growth rate in your area and figure out how many years you are going to live there.  If you live there 10 years and the cost of your home doubles- then you made a lot of money, If the price is stagnant, then you lost money by paying taxes, paying for repairs and paying more $ than you would have rent.

Hey, just bringing this old question up for a vote.
"That would be just great, let the company you are working for (Temp) pay you for using their supplies to find another employer!  And if you did the job that you were hired for (Temp), I suppose that you would want to be paid for doing that, too??\n\nI am sure that if you owned a business, and your Temp employees used your supplies (and time) to look for another job, that you would probably say to them "" Sure, it is ok for you to steal my supplies and the company work time I am paying you for""."
I would look for it and teach it to clean the fridge so i'll never have to do it again and in return it could live there for free.

I would imagine so.  The general concept of a cart with wheels far predates the automobile.  Horse-drawn carriages, wagons and so on.  Though they were probably not called toy cars, the concept was the same.
I would ask my friend if they wanted me to invite him/her. Who knows...it is a chance for you to get to know him/her, and he/she must have some good qualities if your friend likes them...maybe you will make a new friend.
i DO, of course. hmmm, i love the lyrics, and the clip, its good and funny, i guess, haha. its tre cool who dressed up like a woman, and he even wearing make ups?!?!
I don't know if I really miss winter for I live at the winter-less country... But, I think it'd be great if I experience once to go to country with winter season...
You have some slightly more specific questions?  You want *all* the facts?  If so, you'd end up with more facts than you could possibly understand, I suspect.\n\nAsk more specific questions and you'll get much better answers.  Otherwise, just google the heck out of lidar, radar, and laser and you'll learn probably more than you want to know.
The general ledger, sometimes known as the nominal ledger, is the main accounting record of a business which uses double-entry bookkeeping. It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\n\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\n\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\n\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\n\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal.

Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million).

You will get a series of nasty letters and phone calls from the financing company, and attorneys representing the finance company threatening to sue you, demanding that you pay up, etc.  All of these demand letters are spelled out in your financing documents or state lending laws before they can legally foreclose on your mobile home, so to some extent, they are just going through the motions and you should let them.  Given the current state of mobile home lending, they don't want your mobile home back.  They will soak you for every nickel that they can get from you.  Read your financing documents to see exactly what you are on the hook for - it might be much more than you think including repo costs, moving costs, legal costs, etc in addition to losing the mobile home.  It was nice of you to send the keys back to them, but that probably isn't the end of it by a long shot.

"it depends how old she is and how far apart you guys are, but from my experience my sister was a lot younger than i am and when i was a teen ager (a long time ago,lol) i try to do things for that made her feel like she's important to me like watching tv with her going to the mall even just to walk around with some friends made her feel like she's a part of my life bring a ""surprise"" for her when i come home from school like a candy bar or a bag of potato chips made herfeel important to me, if you guys are pretty much the same age try including her in some of the things that your doing, coz it sounds like she's trying to get attention from you but she's doing it in a negative way ,so try to turn that around and in turn you can ask her to respect your privacy."
"Oh yes, full page answers are the worst, however since you looooove them i am going to entertain you with the best pschobabble i can think up, yes it will be entitled, the highlights and low lights of the past 4 days... On Friday i got a lot of new furniture in my house, we just moved in August. My best friend and i had a sleep over which would have been more fun if we weren't so dead tired. She just came from the trainers. Her shoulder is really messed up and makes a sort of clunk sound when she rotates it. Then on Saturday my best guy pal texts me and says he has liked me for two monthes, i was like ""ahhhh crap"" and got really stressed until i totally had my stomach clench beyond belief because i already have a boyfriend. Plus my other best guy friend had also chose this month to announce himself. So I just txted him back and asked if this would kill our friendship and he said no. Then shortly after i get back to breathing he says ""i'm really glad i got that off my chest"" i laughed at the irony... but decided against telling my bf.\n\nSunday my bf (of about 6 monthes) took me out to a nice restraunt for the first time since our first date. It was sweet, then we went to a bookstore and it was funny to see where we went for him, science section for me social science, for him physics for me metaphysics, but we both looked through history (he went for wars while i went for everything but) then we had ice cream. \n\nMonday: text friend tells me i have a nice butt, i tell him he is being inappropriate. best friend tells me about how she had sarah, her other best friend who also likes my bf which is my best friends brother (confusing i know) she was really steamed and yelled at my bf about how on earth he could pick me. he just sorta watched tv, lol he really is a great guy.

The first step in acheiving success is believing in yourself.  When a person doesn't think they're smart enough or good enough, they often end up expecting failure, and get what they expected.\n\nYou could start with education.  The grammar in your question suggests this may be a weak area.  Whether you're in school or not, there are resources you can go to.  If you're still in school, talk to a counselor about getting extra help.  Maybe you have a learning disorder that hasn't been diagnosed.  If you're out of school, the local district proabably has adult classes available.  Having an education helps most people feel better about themselves, and also helps them present themselves to others more effectively.\n\nKeep a journal.  That will help you examine your feelings and learn to express yourself, as well.  When you have a bad day, review what you might have done differently in the journal, and how you think it might have changed the outcome.  \n\nI also recommend counseling or therapy to help you understand and deal with your feelings of failure and where they come from.  And remember this: the only true failure is the failure to try.  Never give up!

"All of God's works are perfect; God is not the author of unrighteousness; so he did not create anyone wicked.(Deut.32:4; Ps.5:4) The one who became satan was originally a perfect son of God. When saying that the devil ""did not stand fast in the truth"", Jesus indicated that at one time satan was ""in the truth"".(John8:44) But, as is true of all of God's intelligent creatures, this spirit son was endowed with free will. He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means ""adversary"".--Jas.1:14,15"

It wouldn't either cater to Carnivores, Vegetarians or Vegans in particular.... simply offer the convenience of quality food for those that haven't the time to prepare it themselves.  \n\nAnd yes, I do think there is a market out there, even though the costs may be more than some are willing to pay."

"Pre-made contracts/agreements are very complicated documents. If you don't know EXACTLY what that document says, you can still get shafted like you didn't have a contract in the first place. \n\nYou should do two things: 1) type a common sense letter that details how much was borrowed, the date the loan must be repaid, etc. and have the borrower sign and date it.  You keep the original. A copy can be given to the other guy.\n\nThen 2) DO NOT make the loan in cash. It should be a check. You should indicate that it's a loan on the memo line (something like ""Loan to Jack to be pd 8/1/06""), and you need to keep the cancelled check in a safe place.\n\nSince it sounds like you want the option of taking legal action, find out what the maximum amount is for small-claims court in the city/county where you live and where the other guy lives.  If small-claims court will only accept cases for $5,000 and under -- don't lend more than that.\n\nThat way if you have to go to court, you can do it on your own in small claims court instead of hiring a lawyer.\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying... but don't accept cash or personal checks as payment. Get it in money order or cashier's check."

What you and your boyfriend shared was obviously something very special and to his family and friends you are basically the link to his last few moments.\n\nSince he loved you so much I am sure that he would want you to go on and live your life and be happy. You can't live in the past and you certainly can't let other people decide the path your life will take. You need the relationship and bonding that only a significant other person can offer.\n\nYou may want to sit down and talk with those who feel that you are betraying them or him and be open and honest about your feelings. Don't let them stop you from discovering all that life has in store for you! My prayers are with you.
You have enough info on the check to make their life miserable. Just think revenge.
I think you need to stay out of it, and let the dad handle it.

Anything that you say to the mom will go in one ear and out the other, and whatever you do, never say anything bad about her in front of the child.

Some say that using honey, especially from your own locale, will help avoid or lessen alergies.  Read the bottle and do not give honey too infants under one year, they do not have mature immune systems to the botulism that may be present.\n\nMy wife swears that a 50/50 mix of honey with ACV (apple cider vinegar) helps prevent her leg cramps and has other beneficial effects.  Heat the ACV first and it will mix much easier with the honey perhaps in a half empty plastic honey bottle (leave air space until mixed).  Then take perhaps three teaspoons per day with apple cider (or any fruit juice).\n\nSugur and honey probably sweeten equally, but honey may have a plus.

The process you are describing is called 'title elimination' or something similar.  In my state, mobile and manufactured homes are licensed just like trailers and cars, by the vehicle licensing department.  By eliminating the title, you are tying the ownership with the land which give lenders a much better lien.  Many lenders won't lend on mobile homes if the title has not been eliminated.  It can also be retitled later if needed.\n\nIt shouldn't have any affect on the value, but may help in obtaining better financing since the market has completely collapsed for mobile home lending.

Well it depends on what you did. Were you unemployed by choice? Did you choose to stay home for family, to help out a friend or family memeber, to take care of someone who is sick and unable to tend to themselves? Medical reasons? There are a number of reason as to how you can explain the gap.

Very much depends on how much money you have to invest and how long you want to invest it.  Today as interest rates are going up, I would be cautious about real estate.  If you buy a house for yourself, go with a fixed rate mortgage.  Mutual Funds might provide a better answer as they have historical offered a higher rate of return.  Look for a company that has performed well year after year. (American Funds, Vanguard)
Insurance licenses are handled on the state level.  They are called the Insurance Department.

I listed a couple of other handy links as well.\n\nTry reading up on the subject -- check out Amazon, your local bookstore or library. \n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo.

"commodity \nThe word commodity is a term with distinct meanings in business and in Marxian political economy. For the former, it is a largely homogenous product, whereas for the latter, it refers generically to wares offered for exchange.\n\nLinguistically, the word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, being derived from the French word ""commodité"" meaning ""benefit, profit"", similar in meaning to biens (goods). The Latin root meaning is commoditas, referring variously to the appropriate measure of something; a fitting state, time or condition; a good quality; efficaciousness or propriety; and advantage, or benefit. The German equivalent is die Ware, i.e. wares or goods offered for sale."
"For making my own video I use a digital video camera. A Canon GL3 to be exact. After planing a script to convey the desired message I shoot the video.

Once it's all to my liking I save it.

He was a ficticious character and opinions vary as to who his true identity was - see links below for a few\n--------\nThe real Captain Starlight was a villain named Frank Pearson, who at various times used aliases including Dr. Pearson, Major Lacey and Gordon. He was born in England in 1837 and arrived in Australia in 1866. His immediate movements are unknown, however, in 1868 he surfaced in northern New South Wales in company with a Queensland bushranger named Charles Rutherford. They bailed up a party of travellers near Walgett, stealing some money and a revolver. However, the travellers were able to give a good description of the men to the police and soon a Queensland Police trooper named McManus, a New South Wales trooper named McCabe and a blacktracker were on their track.\n----------\nMention the name Harry Redford in Longreach and you're sure to be greeted with tales from local residents that have been handed down from their parents and grandparents.\n\nDuring the last 117 years, the man has become something of a local legend.\n\nAlthough writers have, to date, written about Harry Redford, recent evidence presented by Patrick McCarthy in his book 'The Man who was Starlight',has proven that Redford's name was in fact Henry Readford. But whether he be Redford or Readford, to local residents he has come to be more popularly known as 'Captain Starlight' - a ficticious name drawn from Rolfe Boldrewood's Australian classic 'Robbery Under Arms'.

Only a brief explanation...\nTo sell a product / service to a consumer / customer, we need to get in touch to that person as much as possible to convince him / her to buy.\n1. If you know the streets that consumer often go, you have to be there => that's the billboards, signboards, that's the buses, cabs, that's the stations, malls, supermarkets...\n2. If you know where that person usually hangs out with friends/relatives, you have to be there too => that's the cinemas, theatres, bars, clubs, beaches, resorts...\n3. If you know when he / she usually watches TV or his / her favorite programs, you have to be there again. That's the commercials, that's the sponsorships, the games, football matches...\n4. If you know the specific activities that person likes to perform, try to be at the spot too. That's the events, the shows, the contests, the marathons...\n\n...\n\nThose are called consumer touchpoints. Integrated marketing is all about how you can utilize your resources to be at those touchpoints and win the consumer's hearts. Because when you win his heart, his pocket will follow.\n\nOfcourse, sometimes you know one touchpoint in that consumer's routine, but you just can't afford to be there.

My thoughts on that are to push your own confort zone. Do things that you never thaught you'd do, even If you think you won't be good at it. Just have fun with it. Weather it's buying art supplies, and making an awful picture, getting sand paper and sanding down an old piece of furniture and restaining it, doing a public social event if your not very social,Ect. If you start feeling silly about it, or questioning why your doing it, Just remember that its your comfort zone speaking.

"Mortgage bankers tend to use funds from their own credit lines to get you into a mortgage.  Then they sell you to a big company (Countrywide, Homeside, etc) and repay their credit line with those funds and lend to the next person, etc etc.\n\nMortgage brokers take your loan to whomever has the best rates and lowest pricing (or, at least the good ones do).  In theory, your mortgage broker is supposed to shop around FOR you, getting you the best deal.\n\nBut you *must* do your due diligence as a consumer and shop for rates.  Just because someone is friendly and seems honest doesn't mean the next company might not have a lower rate or lower fees.  Get all quotes and estimates in writing, make sure the company making the quote is willing to lock you *SAME DAY* (rates change from day-to-day, and in as little as hour-to-hour).  Make sure you are given a good faith estimate of fees.  Alot of shady brokers/bankers/internet companys say ""No points!"" but then charge an origination FEE equal to a point+.  (See?  It's a ""fee"" not a ""point""!)\n\n**Do not let prospective agents pull your credit until you have decided who you will do business with!**\nCredit inquiries will diminish your credit score.  You might end up inquiring yourself right out of a good mortgage rate if you have too many recent inquires!\n\nOnce you have those lists of fees and rates, the decision is fairly simple who to do business with.  There are more than enough people out there doing mortgage loans that one company doesn't need to get fat on any one loan.  \n\nGood luck and happy hunting!"

There is absolutely, positively, nothing wrong with asking silly questions\n'Why did the apple fall on the ground why didn't it fall in the sky?' - this silly question was asked by one dude named Newton. I don't know why he asked such a silly question.\nSome people here have a feeling that they are real know-alls and there are others who are just too serious about life. The know-alls must understand that it was by mere chance that they were able to experience or read or learn about a certain fact while others were not so fortunate. For the other types, it will be too late, when they understand that life is to be enjoyed even when you are on your death-bed provided you have the right attitude.

Legally, your employer cannot make you start working any earlier than the exact second you shift starts, but you would have to begin work immediately then. If your contract states an 8 hour day with 40 paid minutes break, then that is all you legally have to work.\n\nSadly, the legal system isn't going to pay much attention to five minutes. If your boss tells you five minutes, then you must think about the reprecussions of refusing to do so, as he could easily find reasons to fire you and would be left unquestioned.\n\nAlthough it's not technically 100% legal, think about it practically before taking any action.

I would live my life as if I always have. If you live your life like its your last five minutes, you really can't go wrong. I would like to say I live my life like it is my last everyday. Even though sometimes I don't, I try to live like its my last. So the answer would have to be the same as any other day.

As an IBO, my first responsibility is to account for all monies that are received and all monies that are expenses.  For instance, I am involved in a number of business (as an IBO) and I have a separate bank account for income and expenses for them (ie: one bank account, several streams of income and expenses, but the IRS would like to see personal monies and business monies separated. I was lucky in that one bank in my area gave me $300 just for opening a business account.  Of course, I ahd to have an EIN, rather than a SSAN, but that can be done with the IRS on line and takes just a few minutes of your time.  Just be sure to keep accurate records of income and expenses for your schedule C at tax time. If you use your car during the operation of the business, go to your local office supply store and get a little mileage booklet for a couple of bucks (tax deductable) for recording your mileage.\ngood luck in your endeavor.\nbob

Not really, men can have children much later in life than women.  Women know they only have a handful of years to have children, so they 'hear their biological clock ticking,' when they are getting close to the age when childbearing becomes difficult or impossible.  Men, on the other hand, can have children basically from puberty into their seventies and even eighties.

We have to use tact......we have to treat all just like we would if we were all socializing at a party and discussing issues together. Yes, the avatars are 'cutsy' instead of true depictions of us. But its provided for all the various reasons we need to use them. I appreciate your candid nature, your openess and your recognition that people do treat it a bit differently. Thank you for making us think with this question."
"In my opinion, your ""friend"" is just searching for attention, albeit negative.  Something must not be right in her life (ie. no father figure in the picture) because she sounds desperate for a ""man's"" acceptance. Sit her down and tell her how you feel. It's not just her ""doing you a favor"", she's being self-destructive."

Actually it isn't legally or humanly wrong to show your real emotions in public. But it's just the way our society works. Think about it, if you showed your real emotions at work, and still managed to complete your job, people would still term you as 'un-professional', because they think that that sort of behaviour would disrupt everyone else's performance (which is probably true). You see, human beings are taught to handle personal matters discretely, and if you suddenly expressed your strong emotions to a person you'd probably throw him/her offguard. And of course the real key to having successful friendships and acquaintances with people is that you can control your emotions around them. You may feel angry, but you don't directly hit out at them, right? But if you're overjoyed, well then, I guess there isn't any harm in expressing yourself. \nRemember, it isn't wrong to show your emotions (and it's good to learn to control them), it's just that people are not used to it.

Yes and no. \n\nI don't believe that the good (or evil) done in this life will be revisited upon you in the next. There is no afterlife or reincarnation.\n\nHowever, I do think that people who do good things often see good things done to them and vice versa. This is not a hard rule. Plenty of people are terrible, yet enjoy wonderful lives. Many people are chronic do-gooders, yet suffer at every turn. However, I find that often a good deed is rewarded, if only by increasing the aggregate sense of happiness in the immediate vicinity.

The concept came with the beginnings of glass mirrors.  The process of silvering glass was difficult and very expensive.  The curse was set upon chamber maids and ladys-in-waiting so that they would be careful with their mistress's mirror.\nSome would have us believe that the seven years comes from the Roman believe that life had a seven year renewal cycle and breaking a mirror while looking into it would damage the seer for seven years.  I do not put much faith into this since most Roman mirrors were usually metal and most mirrors are not being stared into when they are broken (they are usually dropped while being transported).
If that was true why is it that there are people who die young ??? God has not promised anyone any number of years that will guaranteed to be lived!

Distilled water is water that has had virtually all of its impurities removed through distillation (boiling the water and collecting the steam).\n\nBecause of its relative purity, some of the properties of distilled water are significantly different from those of the water most people consume and use in everyday life.\n\nA potentially dangerous property of distilled water is that it can be heated above its boiling point without showing the normal characteristics of boiling, called superheating. When the superheated water is disturbed or has impurities added to it, a sudden, explosive boil occurs, possibly causing serious injury to anyone near it.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why you should drink filltered, spring, or drinking water over distilled water is because they contain minerals that are important for your body.

Studies have shown that the most successful way to stop smoking is by sudden determination (of all the methods, this corners over 60% of the success rate). If you are adament about stopping you will stop. Don't use patches, don't use gum - simply stop. \n(I had my last cigarette yesterday and am finding this method easy).\nIf you can't succeed with determination - then it's not your time to quit. Wait until you are determined and try again.

Hi L,\n\nThis is a topic that I have studied in much detail over the past 3 years. There are ALOT of ways to make money online, however, the moment you log on to the internet you are bombarded by ALOT of different sites telling you how to make money and that you`ll be a millionaire overnight. It takes time to filter out the crap from the genuine income generating programs. \n\nI have researched literally thousands of the different offers I'm sure you see every day on the internet. You could spend a fortune trying all these different business opportunities out for yourself. I did and believe me 95% of them didn't work but now I'm making quite a bit using a number of different websites. \n\nOne of the ones I found worked best is Protry.com or DataEntryPros. \n\nBasically you sign up with them and then simply enter in lines of data they give you, send it back and they send you out a check! I get checks from them every 2 weeks each averaging around $200-$300. You could make more but I just use the site as an extra bit of cash aswell as my full time job (which I love!) so I only work on it for around an hour each night. \n\nYou do have to be prepare to spend a small amount of money but just do what I did..all of these sites offer a 30 day money back guarantee..use them for 30 days, make some cash then just cancel the \nsubscription...I know you won`t though! :o) \n\nHere`s the link you can get them at anyway -> www.protry.com \n\nHope this helps!\nGoodluck,\nMatthew

"My very first job before getting into radio was a grounds keeper at a local ""Memorial Park"", as we liked to call it.  I have first hand knowlege on this subject.  Our grave yard was situated on a hillside.  This sometimes meant that we had to actually dig the graves by hand instead of using a backhoe.  Anyway, I hate to say that sometimes the casket does not make a gracefull landing in the vault.  One time we were burrying this man, and his casket was oversized, and his family only ordered a normal size vault(the vault is the cement box that the casket is put into) After the fmily left, we had to take the handles off of the casket to make it fit.  It was a tight fit, but we finally got him in.  One time (i was not working there for this one) A groundskeeper was lowering a casket, he did not wait until the family left the cemetary, and seeing as how the grave was in a hilly area as he lowered the casket, he had to use his foot to guide the casket down.  The family totally flipped out, they thought this guy was jumping up and down on their relitive.  So to answer your question, they usually wait for the family to leave...because accidents can happen."

It's almost impossible to seal a house well enough to keep them out. Sonic devices don't work. You either have to poison them or trap them. If you prefer, you can trap them without killing them and let them go a couple of miles from your house. The best traps use batteries and shock the mice, killing them instantly and painlessly.
Depend on him?  Don't you want to do things for yourself and for others as opposed to closing your eyes and hoping Jesus swoops down to fix things?  I think you should make the difference if you beleive that the world needs to change.  If you want you can even do it on behalf of your church but by no means do I think we should depend on Jesus to do everything.

No black & white answer here, but to me it depends how long ago, by how much and what does the rest of the evidence is. Will you take out a good teacher for one mistake? Our current president got in to more trouble than that and still made it to the highest office in the land.
Interesting question Pharos91. \n\nOn the face of it you could just pick and age like 70, 80, 90, etc. But it isn't quite as simple as that. The majority of people die when they are old but few actually die of old age. Most die of an illness or disease of some description and that is not the same as dying of old age. \n\nAs an example. My two grandmothers both died at an old age. One had suffered a heart condition for thirty years and finally died age 96. She died as the result of a heart attack. The other simply went to sleep one night and never woke up again. She was 101. There was no evidence of any medical condition, her organism had nothing left to give and merely  quit working. She died of old age.\n\nSo, in answer to your question. A person dies of old age when the body has used up all of its resources and the organism ceases to function of its own accord. And since that will depend on what resources there were to start with, you can't simply apply a label like 70, 80 or 90.

"'Little House in the Big Woods' is the first book in the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder.  This is what's on the back of the book:\n\n""Wolves and pnathers and bears roamed the deep Wisconsin woods in the 1860's.  Still, Laura Ingalls' father perferred to live miles away from the nearest neighbors.  So Pa built a snug cabin for Ma, Laura, mary and Baby Carrie.  He hunted and trapped and farmed.  Ma made her own cheese and sugar.  All night long, the wind holwed lonesomely, but Pa played his fiddle and sang, keeping the family safe and cozy.""\n\nIt's basically a story about a Laura and her family's adventures of living in a cabin in the woods.  It mostly covers daily life, the excitement of going to town, special events such as Christmas and dances, and harvest.  I loved this series as a child and I just reread it last year.  I highly recommend it."

"Absolutally! - Try the ""Round Robin Effect"" Go to a bank and open a secured credit line of $1000. Go to another bank and do the same. Do this to three different banks. pay off two of them in the first 30 days and switch them to unsecured. This will boost your credit score tremendously - You will have three open accounts of 1000., two with a zero balance, this is called a ""tradeline"" when people pull your credit to see if you approve - all for a total investment of 1000.00"

"There are so many ""how's""  boy oh boy... One thing I can say is that you have to have patience.  You have to have it in your mind that you will work with it through the profitless times.  \n\nYou will need to have a ""real"" job in the mean time.  Because your bills will still keep coming even though your income won't. a huge percent of start up business lose money in the beginning. They say that the majority of them go under within the first 5 years.  If you can make it past that point you have a shot at keeping it going and actually haveing it be profitable.  I have my own business and It took about 2 (TWO) years before I got my FIRST order!!  I have now been in business for about 5 years and making money.  If I wanted to I could even have enough to do in order to hire employees.  But it took time.  \n\nThe second most important thing  - I must stress this - it is VERY important - YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING THAT OTHERS WANT.   Wether it is a service or a product... if others don't want it you will NOT make a penny.  \n\nGood luck with it!!"

"As interest rates fall people will refinance at the new lower rates. Investors in mortgage backed securities with have their principal returned to them early. This is known as ""reinvestment risk"", as investors will have to find a new place for the money and the interst rates will be lower. CMO's try to midigate this risk by establishing trantches (www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp).\n\nAs interest rates rise pre-payments will decline reducing reinvestment risk. However, the investor will still be exposed to interest rate risk. Meaning that new issues of mortgage backed securities will offer higher returns. The rates of default will increase for marginal borrowers with adjustable rates. In most cases this won't affect the investor, as the bank will foreclose and liquidate the asset. In both cases you will have credit risk, but this in minor, as they are backed by the assets (properties).\n\n* Use this information at your own risk. Consult your financial advisor."

I wouldn't say it's nasty, alot of guys like girls to be open but they can also be turned off by it. I think that if your in a relationship and your serious that eventually you'll feel alright to do those things. I dont think that any girl is nasty for doing this. I think that they are just comfortable with themselves.

Many guys, (depending on how old he is...or not) will be mean to girls they like. There was this guy in my 3 grade class with me. He kept pulling my hair & hiding my lunch. He would even say mean things to me, but it turned out that he liked me. As I grew older it seemed like the guys were just as immature. They would do the same things, but they would act wierd around a girl they liked.

"Read ""Sword of Truth"" series by Terry Goodkind.  If you liked LOTR you'll enjoy him.  There is also the ""Dragonlance"" series and ""Riders of Pern"" are good fantasy.  Some adventure books could be ""The Vanished Man"" by Jeffery Deaver, ""Da Vinci Code"" by Dan Brown.  They are sort of mystery, but still really good.  If you want a light book try the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.  They are funny, light, and offer some adventure/mystery with a splash of romance.\nHappy Reading!"

We use ShareASale & pay out $25 to our affiliates once a sale is made & ShareASale takes another $5. $30 a sale is a pretty small price to pay for us. And I'm sure most programs like that allow you to set the commission rate (no point in your commission being half the price of a sale for you!)\n\nI listed a couple of handy sites relating to marketing, promotion & advertising. I hope they’re helpful for you.\n\nLastly, have you checked to make sure the name you're using is truly available? Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning.

"Art bell is no one...\nWho told you he exist?\nDude how can a person who does not exist have a brain?\n\n\nI hate art bell you know why... Bcoz of his HATE LETTER TO THE FILIPINOS... Here read...\n\n-------------------------\n\nFilipinos.....*make me puke* (Art Bell)\n\nAs we've all come to notice, in the past few decades, Filipinos have begun to infest the United States like some sort of disease. Their extensive involvement in the U.S. Armed Forces is proof of the trashy kind of qualities all filipinos tend to exhibit on a regular basis. You can see this clearly by studying the attitudes and cultural Icons of most Filipino Americans.\n\nOrigins of Pinoys/Pinays: \n\nAre they really asian? Well we've come to accept the fact the filipinos come from a part of the world known as South East Asia. But the term ""Asia"" is used in the wrong way. You may notice that contemporary Filipino Americans try very hard to associate themselves with groups that we know as Asian. I cannot count the number of times I have seen a 'Third World' Filipino try to connect themselves to the chinese or Japanese people. There is no connection and here's why. The Philippines is a Third World country. Nothing respectable has EVER been created by Filipino people during our entire human history. Young filipino men in America have become obsessed with ""import racing"". They have an enormously perverted affection for Japanese cars. It's a common phenomenon. In their minds, these Filipinos somehow believe that they are asian and that it somehow connects them to Japanese people and japanese cars. They often take credit for the ingenuity of Japanese people and say how it's an ""Asian thing"". This term...""Asian thing"" derived directly from African American slang ""black thang"". ""It's a black thang."" ""It's an asian thang."" \n\nYou can see the connection. It's even funnier that, in Japan, Filipinos are heavily discriminated against. The only filipinos that can live successfully in Japan are the filipino prostitutes. But that's the case for most Filipino people no matter where they live in th e world. Now we've come down to this fact...and it is a fact. \n\nNothing in Filipino Culture can be seen as Asian.\n\nThey have no architectural, artistic, or cultural influence which is in ANY way, asian. Thinking of the great countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and China there is no way you can possibly connect the Philippine Islands. This assault by filipino americans to connect themselves with the great peoples of North East Asia is foul and disgusting. Try visiting a young filipino's web site too. \n\nYou'll see something called the ""Asian IRC Ring"". It has to do with the chatrooms. The most horrible thing about this is that these TRASHY people are trying to associate themselves with Asia again!! People in Asia don't act like this at all. What we are seeing here is the natural Filipino in its element with full access to technology and this is how they act! You will consistently see this behavior over and over again. \n\nAnother interest ing thing is that these ""thirdworld"" people also frequent RC chatrooms such as #chinese #japan and #asian. They must believe that they are somehow related racially or culturally to North Asians. But it's completely WRONG!

No, thirteen is my lucky number. \n\nGood and bad luck are all relative to a person's belief. If you think something is bad luck, you'll interpret events as if that 'bad luck' thing made events that way. If you think it's good, you'll look at the good things.
Simply disclose the fact you have convicted and be honest.  Someone somewhere will cut you some slack.  It may be tough but that's the price you pay.  Focus on the positive and look into jobs you have without needing a license, perhaps a journeymen or construction job might work.  Good luck.

"Of course there is some question of, ""Why are we here?"" and the ""Meaning of life?"" I believe strongly in God. I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins, your sins, and everyone sins. Jesus, bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden. Sacrificing something pure, like a lamb, then was the gap filled. But then Jesus came, a pure being, God’s only son, he was like the lamb, pure and without sin, sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us. Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life. \n\nGod is so significant in my life. My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer. I didn’t think God cared. Later I experienced trials of my faith. I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for the best. \n\nOne certain case, I believe, would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me. I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school. I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground. I noticed the school was completely empty. I cannot recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by. Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair. She was pushing a baby in a stroller. She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground, which I had been the whole time. She slowly approached and asked if I was all right. Of course, I said yes, trying to shrug her off. She asked me if I knew about Jesus. I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God. I already knew all that stuff, I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church. She smiled and said that that was nice. She then said something I will never forget. She said with a smile on her face, “Alright, just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset.” I smiled, thinking that she was being nice. She started walking away and she said, “Nice talking to you, Michael.” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings. I then realized, I never mentioned my name. I didn’t even know her. In a small community, I had never seen her before. I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her. She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike. I turned the corner and she wasn’t there. It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast, especially with a baby. I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength. It was a great feeling. I rode my bike home faster than ever. I was crying all the way home.\n\nI have told this story to only a few people. I never expected people to believe me; I could care less if they didn’t. I believe what happened. I was there. That helped incidence helped me so much. I felt much better after that. Today, I still have problems. I am human. But I can always turn to Jesus for help. I believe in him by Faith, and Faith alone. That is all you need to attain salvation! Faith.\n\nI hope you understand to that God loves you. \n             God Bless You!\n                  Michael DeCourcy"

Good one kermit.\n\nNow, everything is a learning process.  I think it is important to have passion for your beliefs but at the same time always remain open for debate.  If anything, if you are on the wrong side of logic or common sense on something, you're bound to discover it sooner.\nWe have to make judgements and decisions at fixed times in our lives.  Rather than beat yourself up over the past, try and flesh out a good process for how you analyze things and react to them, then use that process and adjust as needed.  Use the past to learn from and keep growing! Also, really look into anything that contradicts deeply held beliefs and run it through a vigorous ringer before you assume you were wrong.  You've made it this far on your wits and common sense, there's a good chance you've been right more than you give yourself credit for. There are lots of contrarian views being floated out there that are nothing more than hot air, so have confidence in yourself too!

"Hi Rams,\nThanks for the concern. I had asked the question before to Yahoo! Answers Team & I got the answer that most of my questions were identical. It might have happened because, I asked most of them with a format like - ""A Riddle"", ""Another Riddle"" & ""Yet another Riddle"" etc. So, they might have diagnosed that all these questions are identical which they were not.\nAlso, another reason might be that most of my questions were in the ""Jokes & Riddles"" sub-category & thus, were not ""Knowledge-based"". I am now trying to ask diverse questions to get into the leaderboard. \nThanks & Take Care"
The only ashtrays I have out are outside, No smoking in my house. I am a smoker, but don't want my children exposed to the second hand smoke. I would not think poorly of anyone whom did not have ashtrays out if they did not smoke, and there have been many times when visiting someone that even though they permitted smoking in their house, I still went outside.

"Marijuana is an extremely useful plant that should be cultivated legally. The drug aspect of it should be decriminalized and treated as cigarettes and  alcohol are, with age limits and extreme taxation. We could pull this country half way out of debt simply by taxing the marijuana market. The effects of the drug are no more imparing than that of alcohol and the idea that this is a gateway to harsher drugs is ridiculous. If it were as legal as alcohol and cigarettes, it would be no more a ""gateway"" to smoking or injesting illegal things than they are also. Our tax dollars are better spent enforcing and punishing violent crimes and not looking for a college kids smoking a joint."

"Last question first: and how can one know whether they r in true love \n\nBeing ""in love"" is like an orgasm--when it happens you'll know.  If you're not sure it's probably some similar features but not the real thing.  If by ""true love"" you mean the love that's deeper than an exciting infatuation, then you can tell that by the feelings that come in as the excitement ebbs.  If the excitement dies down and you feel empty, used, bored, disinterested, then ""true love"" isn't on the way and you can't force it.  If comfort and satisfaction fill in as excitement ebbs, then you've got a keeper.  That kind of true love is so good for me I don't miss the excitement that much (I've been married forever).  It sounds weird, but it really does feel deep, like a river, while infatuation feels like a rushing mountain stream.  If you're willing to give up the pleasures of the stream for the pleasures of the river, I'd say that's true love.  It might sound like a bad trade-off, but with the right person it feels like a natural change, not a loss.  I know I thank my lucky stars every day for getting to the point we're at now.\n\n\n>how to know whether someone loves u or not?\n\nIf the other person is hiding it and doing a good job, you may never know.  If the other person is faking it I don't think they could pull it off for long unless they're a psychopath or something, in which case there would be other symptoms like excessive controlling and maybe abuse.  Between total faking and total compatibility there's lots of room for innocent ignorance and ineptitude.  If I had to pick one acid test I guess it would be how the other person handles situations where not everybody's needs get met.  For a love relationship to work, both people have to graciously put themselves second a reasonable percentage of the time.  That doesn't mean being a doormat, but it does mean thinking beyond themselves.  Someone who can't do that, or won't learn how, isn't capable of loving someone, even if they have strong feelings that they call ""love""."

if you invest in the stock market try having a very broad portfolio. have stocks from large cap(5 bil and up) mid cap (1-5 bil) and small cap(under 1 bil). also dont get all stocks from one market like compuer reasearch try to have a variety of companys in case one industry fails or does poorly(aircraft). If your really bad get a broker to handle your money. you will not get money instantly. that is how you lose money. hold on to stocks for 5-10 years and it will payoff you will not get rich overnight. mabey try investing in mutual funds. where a group of people pool their money and buy lots of companys so even if some companys fail you still make money. im 17 and invested 5000 in a mutual fund and in one year I have 7000. with a 10 year projected value of 25000. so dont jump to decisions and reasearch a company enough so in 1 min you could explain to a 5 year old why you are investing in that company. look at companys competetors.

Negotiate with the creditor to lower your interest and ask for forgiveness of late fees etc that they might have charged.\n\nI have had late fees forgive a couple of times just for the asking.  \n\nNegotiate with every credit card you have, once you get a card witht he lowest interest transfer all balance to that card or as much as you can into that card.\n\nPay the card with highest interest rate first.  As soon as you pay it off, cut that card off and thrwo it in the trash.  RINSE and REPEAT\n\nAt the end you will have one credit card left and pay that off.\n\nAll this while you MUST refrain from using credit again or else it will not work.  Cash your paycheck and use cash/debit card for all your expenses.\n\nMake a list of things you purchase every month and find out where you can cut cost.  Don't goto movies for a year, dont eat out, buy generic groceries, skip vacation and take double pay.  \n\nThe best is use your tax refund to pay off your debt.  Since you are used to living without that money as soon as you get your refund before you spend it pay it all into your highest interest credit card.\n\nGood luck.

How Do I Get Saved?\nTHE PRAYER OF SALVATION\nRemember God loves you.  He wants you to be whole and complete or saved – spiritually, emotionally, physically, mentally, financially, and socially (3 John 2).  Pray this prayer, mean it, and YOU will be saved, right where you are sitting. \n\nFather in heaven, thank you for sending your Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for me, and for His blood that was shed to redeem me and to cleanse me from my sins.\n\nLord, I am sorry and I repent of my sins. Forgive me.  I understand that I must change the course of my life.  I am determined in my heart to follow you.\n\nI invite you to become the Lord of my life from this point forward, forever. I openly proclaim and confess that you are the Lord of my life.\n\nI believe in my heart that You have been raised from the dead.  Therefore I am saved.  I am a new creature. The old things have passed. All things have become new.  I am a child of God.

"God. (cheating) This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."

"I guess you are talking stereotyping and unfortunately that continues.  There is no easy answer as to why this continues.  Most of us know that these are poor assumptions and too often not true.  I also think that what you see on television varies as well.

Best way is to use a needle and thread.  Push needle through the banana in a pattern forming a square.  At each corner feed the needle back through the same hole that it and the thread came throug.  When you get back to the start hold both ends of the cotton and gently pull the cotton out of the banana.  This neatly cuts the banana without mashing it (like the other idea).  If you do this 3 or 4 times you can peel the banana and eat it in ready made segments.\n\nI remeber the same book of magic tricks.

Where did such a funny unit of purity come from? It turns out that a German gold coin called a mark was common about a thousand years ago. It weighed 24 carats (4.8 grams). The purity of the gold in the coin was expressed in the number of carats of gold present in this 24-carat coin.

"Well, one of the most important skills in communicating is to listen--really listen--when other people are talking to you. \n\nBeing successful in an organization requires knowing who has the ability to get stuff done (i.e., who has power).

The Roth is another good choice for college education. It gives you a bit more flexibility if your child does not go to college or if he or she gets a scholarship. The only downside to using a roth is losing the tax advantages. You will have to pay ordinary imcome tax on any earnings. I would recommend using the roth exclusively until you can at least max it out. When you get to that point use the 529. I am an advisor and even the wholesalers that come to talk recommend the roth over the 529 if you cant fund it significantly.\n\nextra info: \nThe Roth was created for retirment planning however it does offer penalty free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Investments will grow tax deferred just like 529 but will be taxable when withdrawn if used for school.
Starting salary is at $100 - $150 plus benefits, signing bonus, bonus, etc.  In good years (dot com era), bonuses could be multiple(s) of the salary.  Then there's always the other perks such as food, frequent flier miles, etc.  Long hours required.

"There is no such thing as a ""Family"" crest, although a dozen merchants will sell you a crest or coat of arms that was once issued to someone with your surname. Just Google ""Coat of Arms"" and look for a linkk neding in "".com"".\n\nTwo genealogy programs will help you trace your family history, \nFamily Tree Maker\nRoots Magic\n\nThere are others. FTM is the market leader, I like RM better. They are both $29. Neither will do the work for you. They are to family History what ""Word"" is to a term paper - tools. You have to do the work. They make it easier, but it would take a couple of hours a week for a month or two on your part to get a good foundation.\n\nWrite if you are still interested. Most Yahoo! users are not.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe descent of arms was and remains strictly regulated by inheritance; only certain actual descendents of a particular armigerous (arms-bearing) person are entitled to his arms or a differenced version of them — hence popular associations of a coat of arms with all bearers of a surname are based on a misconception. Heraldry is mostly a hobby today; but in some countries (e.g. Scotland) it remains regulated by heralds and the assumption of another's arms is illegal.\n\nThe word ""crest"" is commonly used to refer to a coat-of-arms. However, in heraldry, a crest is just one component of a complete achievement of arms. The crest sits atop a helmet, which itself sits on the main and most recognizable part of the arms, the shield or escutcheon. Other elements may include supporters holding up the shield and a motto beneath. Crests can in fact be used on their own (this is particularly useful when there is insufficient space to display the entire coat-of-arms); but where the shield alone is used it should never be called a ""crest""."

I think you are as befuddled as most.\nHeterosexual if taken literally means only male and female.\nHomosexual if taken literally means only same with same.\nBisexual refers to any person/s who have ever been with both sexes.  I when young did venture some male-male actions as a consequent of being that age, while now I do not pursue relations with any other human or animal: hence, I am asexual at this time in my life.  However, all considered, due to the sum of things past,I would have to be labled as a bisexual even though I did not enjoy those few curious events and for the bulk of my active life I was content with heterosexuality.  For the longest, always the woman so very worthy of my admirations and best regards.  I'm grateful for them making our babies and for recieving my birth.  Suggest you incorporate the facts of a lifetime in shaping your definition as being a matter of the person's actual history and who do you know that has never went the route of same-sex curiosity?  Life is but the sum of a person's total experiences and it better to be honest since any exception to the facts of venturing at least one bisexual act is a lying person.

Absolutely, critical thinking involves taking a logical approach to whatever answer you are trying to come up with by thinking critically.  It means you have to approach whatever problem you are trying to solve and think about it logically.  Go through all the details of the problem and question, sort through the various options or theories and pick which one most logically seems to fit.\n\nHere's a fairly accurate definition: s a term used to refer to those kinds of mental activity that are clear, precise, and purposeful. It is typically associated with solving complex real world problems, generating multiple (or creative) solutions to a problem, drawing inferences, synthesizing and integrating information, distinguishing between fact and opinion, or estimating potential outcomes, but it can also refer to the process of evaluating the quality of one's own thinking.

To be honest, I think that the majority of racist people in the the U.S. are African Americans. Many of them think that everything you say is directed at them because of their color. It's not true.

If you are in the United States, your high school GPA has nothing to do with your ability to become a physician.  It does effect your ability to get into a college or university that will help your chances of getting accepted into medical school.  Medical School, as I understand it, is not as popular as it used to be, but can still be competitive to enter.  \n\nYour best bet is to major in pre-med, biology, zoology, etc and buckly down to get the best grades you can and prepare for the MCAT exam, which is a key factor in getting accepted into med school.  The college you attend can also be a factor in that a good GPA from a recognized school will be more competitive than from a tier 4 school, all other things being equal.  It also will prepare you better to succeed in Med School.
My experience is that it doesn't effect it very much.  The way the darn credit scores are calculated, it may even help it out.  \n\nJust a word of advice. If you do consolidate your depts get rid of your credit cards.  Too many people end up adding more debt to those cards and end up bankrupt.

Try getting a job. You can apply for a government grant and get some schooling and get a good job.

The following address is an exact search for an Eric Chestfield on Yahoo!. You can try rummaging through the results.
As we look forward to AD 2000, what does the AD mean? A generation ago, there were still schoolchildren who could tell you that AD represents a Latin term, “animal dominoes” or something. Not anymore. As a result, AD is now sometimes replaced by CE (for “Christian Era”, or “Common Era”).\n\nThe term “AD” was created by a monk named Dionysius Exiguus in 525 AD. Before that time, dates were calculated by an individual king’s reign (“In the fifth year of Emperor Augustus”, “In the second year of King Henry VIII”) or dated from the founding of a kingdom or an empire.\n\nDionysius noticed that kings died, and even empires vanished (the Roman Empire, after flourishing for centuries had collapsed just the century before). This created confusion, with some people following one calendar, and others another calendar. (This confusion is why Dionysius made a mistake of 4-6 years in trying to calculate the year of Jesus’ birth.) Dionysius therefore proposed establishing a calendar based on a kingdom which would never end. He began counting time from Jesus’ birth.\n\nAD literally means “In the year of the Lord”. Thus, this year, instead of being the seventh year of Jean Chretien’s prime ministership, is the 1999th year of Jesus’ reign. In establishing the “AD” calendar, Dionysius was not just finding a convenient starting point for a calendar. He was declaring that he accepted Jesus as his King and that he was a citizen of the Kingdom of God. Those who follow Jesus today, declare the same thing.\n\nby Jim Coggins
The best thing is to give a training video for all new hires, and have a written policy on the companies view on harassment, what constitutes harassment, and what the consequences are.  Most people will behave themselves if they know the organization takes it seriously.  Have each person sign a sheet that they have received the training, so if anything happens, you can show that your organization did not create a workplace permissive of this behavior.

"IT's the true cost of obtaining the loan in terms of interest rate.\nThe APR will typically be the same or higher than the note rate.  The note rate is the actual rate/payment you pay against the loan.  \nThe fees involved directly raise the rate by virtue of being added to (sometimes subtracted from in the case of a ""no fees"" loan)the loan balance, after which the APR is calculated.\n\nIn most cases , the lower the APR (compared to the note rate), the better.  But not always.  This is a complex issue, and depends on many factors, such as how long you plan to keep the property, etc..\n\nA good loan agent can help you make the choice."

"Read the article I wrote: ""Is the Housing Bubble Real?"" http://burlingamerealtor.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/2006/02/16.html\n\nI suggest reading ""Are You Missing The Real Estate Boom?"" by David Lereah\n\nReal Estate prices can't go to zero, unless there was a reason for people to flee that area or the interest rates shot up suddenly and much higher than what we could imagine, whatever the size of that area. It's not likely that interest rates will shoot up quickly. So ask yourself if the people of the area you are thinking about have a reason to leave the area suddenly.\n\nIf they don't, then there will likely be no real estate bubble in that area. \n\nReal Estate is not a short term investment and it's not as liquid as stocks. Stocks can go to zero but it's EXTREMELY difficult for real estate to go to zero.\n\nThe real estate bubble scare has been brought upon by stock brokerages and/or the media since they are tied together or invest in each other. Don't buy into it.\n\nReal Estate is a finite commodity. However, stock shares can be split forever it seems. Also real estate is unique, even if it's in the same complex, if a condo. Is each share of the same stock unique? No, one share of MSFT, for example, is exactly like another share of MSFT! \n\nSo in my opinion, yes real estate can drop by 10%, 15% or 20% but I wouldn't call it a bubble. The price will likely come back up in time, unless the area has been cursed forever. For less risk, buy in an area that's got potential, is near good schools, near shops, near transportation, has a good real estate history and near jobs.\n\nMy strongest suggestion if you are serious in buying is to speak to a good Realtor, (go to http://www.ReferredPro.com) to be referred to one, who can give you some guidance, especially since they work with lots of people in your shoes who are thinking the same thing and lots of others who are making money in real estate. Warning: friends don't necessarily give the best advice, even when they think they are."

Krakatoa (krākətō′ ə, krä–) or Krakatau (kräkätou′ ), volcanic island, c.5 sq mi (13 sq km), W Indonesia, in Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra; rising to 2,667 ft (813 m). A momentous volcanic explosion on Aug. 23, 1883, blew up most of the island and altered the configuration of the strait; the accompanying tsunami caused great destruction and loss of life along the nearby coasts of Java and Sumatra. The explosion is classed as one of the largest volcanic eruptions in modern times; so great was the outpouring of ashes and lava that new islands were formed, and debris was scattered across the Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar. Since then there have been several lesser eruptions.

"The definition appears to be industry-specific.  Here are two definitions, with appropriate links:\n\nIn information technology, gap analysis is the study of the differences between two different information systems or applications, often for the purpose of determining how to get from one state to a new state. A gap is sometimes spoken of as ""the space between where we are and where we want to be."" Gap analysis is undertaken as a means of bridging that space. Among the various methodologies used to perform gap analysis is IDEF, a group of methods used to create a model of a system, analyze the model, create a model of a desired version of the system, and to aid in the transition from one to the other.\n\nor:\n\nGap Analysis is a scientific means for assessing to what extent native animal and plant species are being protected.

Stocks are quoted with bid and ask prices. \n\nIf you place a small market order to buy, you will get filled near the ask. If you place a small market order to sell you will get filled near the bid. Market orders execute at the best market price going.\n\nWith a limit order you specify a maximum price you will pay or minimum price you will sell for. You might not get filled with a limit order.\n\nIf you really want to buy at the market, place a limit order 5 or 10 cents above the ask. Do the same below the bid if you want to sell. This way, if there is a moment of illiquidity, you're not getting filled at some outrageous price.

"You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nNote, however, that it is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born."
"Innovation in technology, creativity, new solutions might be powerful for many companies, specially these days. We introduce an article ""The key to progress"" by G. Haesen, F. Fernández, J-C. Venchiarutti.\n\n""In traditional industries many processes could be made more efficient and less environmentally harmful, but resistance to change often leaves new ideas on the shelf. Sharing knowledge and experience of new techniques is critical to their acceptance, as the case of the printing industry –\nwhere the Subsprint project has helped introduce new methods for cleaning presses – shows.(...)Estimates indicate that offset printers in the European Union use around 100 million litres of organic solvents per year to clean their presses. According to experimental evidence, somewhere between 60\nand 90% of these petroleum-based solvents evaporate into the atmosphere, making the printing industry Europe’s second biggest industrial emitter of\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs in the atmosphere contribute to the thinning of the ozone layer and create smog at ground level; they can also be\ndamaging in soil or water. Print workers inhale organic solvents throughout their work, with the highest exposure levels experienced while cleaning presses. VOCs are known to have harmful effects on lungs, kidneys, liver and skin, and may also affect the nervous system. Replacing the traditional organic solvents with vegetable-oil-based cleaning products\n– which are generally biodegradable\n– would not only reduce environmental\ndegradation but would also have significant benefits for the health of print workers. Subsprint was one of the first technology transfer projects supported by the EU, launched in 1993, and it aimed to encourage the substitution of organic solvents in the printing industry with vegetable cleaning agents (VCAs).(...)With the accompanying measures launched within the Fifth Research\nFramework Programme, we aimed to set up a pilot platform to support the sharing of knowledge. It became clear immediately that the diverse backgrounds\nof team members and the different business sectors involved made it necessary to define a common language during the design of the platform. Such a common language should streamline the knowledge transfer process by facilitating\ncommunication, and by uncovering similarities and differences which may be\nleveraged in the sharing process. This process has substantially succeeded,\nalthough the partners had to overcome significant obstacles before they came to acknowledge fully the importance of trust in the knowledge transfer process. Today, more than ever, firms rely on information and knowledge exchange to facilitate the uptake of new technologies, processes and approaches. Haesen believes that companies aiming for success in the knowledge-based economy must become learning organisations, focused on efficiently acquiring knowledge from sources such as research – on both technical and non-technical sources – consultants, strategic partnerships with other companies, and the knowledge of their own employees. Protecting investments through patents is a short-term solution, but sharing knowledge is an essential step for organisations to become competitive."""

"The term Yankee has a variety of meanings. Generally, it refers to citizens of the United States, particularly northerners, especially those Americans from the Northeastern United States.\n\nOrigins of the term are disputed. One theory customarily held by persons not from New England claims that it originated from the Dutch in old New Amsterdam (today known as New York City) in the Mid-Atlantic States. It then was adopted by the British as a pejorative for (Northern) colonists. The origin might have been the phrase Jan Kees (""John Cornelius"") (two very common Dutch names), which the English-speaking people picked up as ""yankees"", a word they used to refer to the Dutch.\n\nThe Dutch theory is somewhat confused. The settlers of New Amsterdam and the settlers of Massachusetts Bay were totally unconnected and did not come into contact until both communities were sufficiently dense to carry on trade up and down the East Coast. There is no reason why the British should call English settlers in a different location by a Dutch name when New Amsterdam was under Dutch jurisdiction and always had been. Moreover, New York has never been ""Yankee"" except in the world wars of modern times.\n\nThe prevalent theory in New England holds that it originated among a group of Indigenous peoples of the Americas on the East Coast of the United States. They were unable to pronounce the word ""English"", rendering it as ""yengis"" or ""yengeese"". This later was Anglicized to ""Yankees"".\n\nThis theory is widely held, as descendants of those same Native Americans are alive in Massachusetts, mainly as the Wampanoags and are vociferous about their origin and are fairly well publicized. They still know the basic core of their former language and are able to say that in it there is no ""l"" sound. Their ancestors would not have pronounced it, rendering English to ""yengis"".\n\nIn another theory, Indians who first learned of the English from the French may have borrowed the French language name ""Anglais"" and rendered it as something that approximated ""Yankee"" in their own phonetic system. One area in which French, French-allied Indians, and British-descended Americans would have come into contact was the area of frontier warfare conducted during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). This is more or less consistent with the areas in which other derivations of the word would postulate its first use. If this is the origin of the term Yankee, it may originally have had a pejorative, anti-American connotation similar to that of gringo, becoming adopted as a matter of pride by British-descended Americans who had fought on the frontier during the French and Indian War.\n\nThere are several other folk and humorous etymologies for the word.\n\nOne influence on the use of the term throughout the years has been the song Yankee Doodle, which was popular at the time of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Though the British intended to insult the colonials with the song, following the Battle of Concord, it was adopted by Americans as a proud retort and today is the state song of Connecticut.\n\nAn early use of the term outside the United States was in the creation of Sam Slick, the ""Yankee Clockmaker"", in a column in a newspaper in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1835. The character was a plain-talking American who served to mock both American and British North American customs of that era. The stories were published in a book titled The Clockmaker, in 1836. The book was popular in British North America, the United States, and the United Kingdom."

An interest only mortgage does exactly what it says - pays only the interest. For example a $100,000 loan @ 6% interest only for 30 years = a payment of $500. If you were paying a conventional 30 year mortgage the payment would be $600. 100 would go towards paying down the loan. The only way to pay down the mortgage is to pay extra each month or make and extra payment during the year. Now, I.O. (interest only) loan have a lot of benefit if you don't plan on staying in the house for a long time, for example and investor or someone looking to move in the future. The reason for this is because even though you are not paying down the mortgage you are still building equity on your house and only paying the minimum payment to stay in it till you sell it. Hope this helps.

Obviously the web is a great place to start, look through their website, and do a search on the company to see if there are any articles or press on them. A very common, but sneaky way is to have a friend or associate pretend to be a potential customer and have them ask all of the questions you want to learn. Be careful with this method, do not ask any questions that are outside of the standard questions that your customers ask you.

This should be your standard answer to any referance to what happened."
"In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins). Traditionally, virgin is used to describe a person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an ""anal virgin,"" being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of ""virginity"" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\n\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning."
Artificial Insemination (spelled correctly there) would be your best bet.  In AI, you could be the carrier of the baby and have the sperm of your hubby/partner harvested and inserted into you.  There is another kind of option in AI wherein both the egg and the sperm is harvested in both partners but a 3rd party will carry the baby if the female egg-donor is incapable of carrying the child herself.  \n\nOf course, adoption would be another option.

That is a real tough question to answer from outside.\nI think you know that it is not OK for anyone, including your parents, to physically abuse. Spankings and swats are one thing, but it sounds as though you're into something closer to abusive behaviorisms.\nAre they accidents? You should be able to tell by their reactions to these incidents. \nKnow this. Whatever the answer to that, you are worth more than the way you are feeling. I considered suicide many times as a youngster, but God has a plan. \nIs there anyone who could take you in for a while. It sounds like maybe you're just getting caught up in your parent's battle and they aren't necessarily disappointed in you in any way. Still, it is not an easy environment to be in and always has the possibility of danger. \n\nKeep your head up best you can. Pray to the Lord for some resolve...some kind of answer. Use your God-given judgement if it gets too intense. My prayers are with you.

Try to use years instead of months to indicate the duration of each job.  If your gaps are several years, maybe you can address that in your cover letter.  Otherwise, those questions could/need to be answered during the interview.\n\nBelow are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.

Congrats on your new non-profit! Non profits are just like any business - you need to get the word out in order to get the needed funding to help support your activities. Here are some tips to help you market your non profit:\n\n1. Determine your your target audiences: who are the groups and audiences that your non profit wants to reach. Remember that one target group may respond differently to a marketing message as another group so make sure that each strategy is tailor made for each audience.\n\n2. Develop a communications strategy, creating timelines for marketing efforts such as newsletters, press releases, special events, and others.\n\n3. Develop a visual image. Prepare your logo and other branding tools - and use them consistently across various mediums. Make sure that you repeat your branding messages, slogans in everything you make from brochures to newsletters.\n\n4. Employ multiple communications tactics: Nonprofit organizations often target several audiences, which may respond to different approaches. Various communications campaigns can help establish and maintain a more widespread positive image.\n\n5. Select and use appropriate media: Plan to use a combination of approaches best suited to reaching your targeted audiences and that make best use of your financial resources. Include a variety of methods including phone calls, letters, e-mail, newsletters, PSAs, press releases, and editorials.\n\nI have found a website that compiles various resources on starting a non profit. I especially like the Minnesota Council of NonProfits because the site gives information on governance, developing strategic alliances, fund raising and other ingredients of successfully running a non profit.

There are plenty of PPC (pay per click) programs. The 2 biggest, I think, are Google & Yahoo!.\n\nA couple free resources – check out the sources box for links:\n\n1) Create a blog pertaining to your field\n\n2) Use Yahoo! 360, Yahoo! Local & Yahoo! Groups\n\nAlso, consider signing up for an affiliate program. These programs enable you to advertise on other's sites (your affiliates) and once a sale is made to you, your affiliates & the program are paid a commission. We use ShareASale & pay out $25 to our affiliates once a sale is made & ShareASale takes another $5. $30 a sale is a pretty small price to pay for us. And I'm sure most programs like that allow you to set the commission rate (no point in your commission being half the price of a sale for you!)\n\nI listed a couple of handy sites relating to marketing, promotion & advertising. I hope they’re helpful for you.\n\nHope that helps! I wish you much success & happiness in all your ventures!

SODIUM ERYTHORBATE IS PRODUCED BY FERMENTATION OF CORN SUGAR.\nSodium erythorbate is NOT made from earthworms. This was a popular rumor.\n\nSodium erythorbate is an antioxidant which can be used in various food systems: e.g. meat, fish, beverages, fruit and vegetables, etc. Chemically, it is the sodium salt of erythorbic acid which is recognized as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is an epimer (structural mirror image) of sodium ascorbate and is identical in antioxidant effect.\n\nEribate® brand sodium erythorbate is produced by fermentation of corn sugar to meet the specifications outlined in the Food Chemicals Codex (F.C.C.). Eribate® is proven nontoxic in all applications.\n\nSodium erythorbate may be used to preserve freshness in fruit and vegetables. It does this by preventing discoloration and development of off-flavors.\n\nSodium erythorbate serves as an inhibitor of enzymatic browning by scavenging oxygen and by reducing quinones back to polyphenol compounds before they can undergo the reactions to produce brown pigments. Fruit and vegetables can be protected by spraying or dipping them in an aqueous solution of sodium erythorbate. \n\n\n\nErythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are chemical isomers of ascorbates, they are effective antioxidants for applications that do not require a nutritional claim for vitamin activity. The efficiency of erythorbates as antioxidants depends upon the particular food system, the compounds to be protected, the amount of metal contamination, and the amount of oxygen to be removed form the system. Sodium erythorbate is not fat soluble and is most useful as antioxidant in aqueous systems. Erythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are permitted food ingredients in the U.S. Japan and European Union.

"There are two ways to make money from home in both industries. In medical transcription you have the choice of:\n\n1) Contracting with one of the many companies that will send you the work via a secured connection (high speed internet), you do process the work, send it back to them as directed and then you will be paid for the completed work.\n\n2) You can start your own medical transcription business, find your own clients to work with, process their workload and then get paid for the services that you rendered.\n\nIn medical billing there aren’t any legitimate companies that I know of that will hire or contract you to process their medical claims for them so the only option that you have is to start your own home based medical billing business/service.\n\nI do both medical billing and transcription from home and I own the businesses. I have never contracted with other companies to process their work because to me it’s just like working as an employee and we all know that to become financially secure you have to be owner of a thriving business not the hired help.\n\nThere are two resources that you should read because they are by experts within each field: \n\n1) ""Step-By-Step Guide To Medical Transcription At Home"". Michele Miller wrote this book and her advice can be found on every reputable medical transcription message board and forums. She has been in the business for years and is an expert on the topic of how to get involved in this industry so visit http://stelopm.mml461.hop.clickbank.net \n\n2) “Medical Billing Book For Beginners”.

I would definately not sell your home.  Especially if you already have a lot of equity in it.\n\nI wish I had more info.\n\nOK, lets assume you have a some equity in your home, and you have a decent job.  You ran up a lot of money in credit cards.  By the time you finish paying your utility bills and other expenses you don't have enough for payments on your cards.  I bet you have been making minimum payments too, right?\n\nI would not refinance your home unless the interest rate is high.  I'd suggest getting a home equity loan.  That way you roll all your payments into one, and you can write off the interest on your taxes.\n\nBut be warned!!!!  You must get control of your spending and quit using credit cards.  This is the trap that thousands of people have fallen into, and end up filing for bankruptcy.  \n\nThe new bankruptcy laws are a lot worse, and will cost you more. \n\nNow, if you don't have much equity, how is going to sell your home going to pay off your credit cards?  By the time you sell it and pay off the existing mortgage, you won't have anything left to start over with, let alone pay off credit cards.  In this situation you may want to look at going Chapter 7 (if you qualify).  \n\nGood luck

"First, you must realize that she has placed herself in a position were she is not only your boss but also your friend.

You should discuss with her your confusion as to her sudden change in tone when this has been a common scenerio between the two of you.  She may have just had a bad day and your comment was ""the straw that broke the camels back"", and she may apologize first! Other than that you need to discuss with her your limitations in this area. You need to understand that just because you are friends you can't use that to your advantage, nor be angry with her when she has to do her job.  You are the employee and she is your superior.

The house would still be yours regardless of if its only your name, or both names. The living spouse has right to any property before children unless otherwise stated by your husband. Unless your state has some goofy rule, I would suspect this is the case. As stated earlier, the best way to avoid any problems, is to have your husband write a will.
it seems to me that you will have to put pen to paper and see if you will come out ahead financially by the end of the year.try to keep emotion out of the decision.i had to do a similar thing a few years ago.it depends on the amount of support,everything else being equal.

I have formed several joint ventures for the purpose of either funding or to increase market share and the best way to get it done is to approach companies that would benefit directly from your endeavors. For instance: if you have access to gold - diamonds-platinum jewelery thats cheaper then most, then you may want to joint venture with a major jewelry retailer that needs a division in India.
value-added tax \n\nA tax on the value added to a product at each stage of its production, from raw materials to finished product. Widely employed in Europe, value-added taxes have the advantage (for governments) of raising revenue “invisibly,” that is, without appearing as taxes on the bill paid by the consumer.

"The merchant's machine authenticates the account with the financial institution that issued the card. Basically this is checking to see that the card number is valid, and the card itself is valid.\n\nSwiping the card sends the card information, and transaction information to the financial institution. The financial institution returns a numerical code. The code can either be approved, or a trouble code that denies the transaction. If the transaction is denied with a trouble code, the specific code maps to an English definition for the denial of credit. For example, ""credit limit exceeded"", ""card not activated"", or ""not a valid account"".\n\nThe first four-six digits of the account number refer to a specific financial institution, which is a destination for the machine. For example, 5424 is issued by Citibank."
"Its fiction but its very interesting you should give it a read, it does seem so real and i had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't - i think it offends some catholics but i'm a catholic and wasnt offended its very entertaining.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is a novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 2003 by Doubleday Fiction (ISBN 0385504209). It is a worldwide bestseller with 36 million copies in print (as of August 2005) and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy theory genres, the book is part two of a trilogy that started with Brown's 2000 novel Angels and Demons, which introduced the character Robert Langdon. In November 2004, Random House published a ""Special Illustrated Edition"", with 160 illustrations interspersed with the text.\n\nThe plot of the novel involves a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the true story of Jesus. This implies that the Vatican consciously knows it is living a lie, but does so to keep itself in power. The novel has helped generate popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity. Fans have lauded the book as creative, action-packed and thought-provoking. Critics have attacked it as inaccurate and poorly written, and decry the many negative implications about the Christian Church.\n\nThe book opens with the claim by Dan Brown that ""all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate""; but this claim is disputed by academic scholars in the fields the book discusses (see Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code and the further reading list below). As widely noted in the media, there has been substantial confusion among readers about whether the book is factual."

"For me, serendipity is something that comes into my life just when I seem to need it.\n\nIt could be a person, a piece of information, a ""sign"" that tells me I'm making the right decision.  For instance, when we bought a previous home, we knew we would get it because my wife was pregnant and the cross street was ""Concepcion"" (conception).  Another time, the house we made an offer on was on Solana and, when we had dinner at Chili's that night, they had ""Solano Steak"" on the menu.  We got the house.\n\nDo I really believe in ""signs"" from some divinity? No. I just believe that these events are constantly happening but we only register them when we are ready to receive them.  That doesn't dimish the effect of serendipity because it makes life fun and interesting."

If you are in the United States and ship to India, you will be required by the Post Office to fill out PS Form 2976 Customs Declaration. In it, you will state the quantity and detailed description of the contents, weight and total value. The recipient on the other hand may pay custom duties on the item/s received depending on the rules of their postal services. \n\nSellers on eBay as well as other sellers anywhere on the Internet -- whether you use the post office, private shippers or customs brokers -- are all required to fill out the custom form when shipping to buyers. Ecommerce companies like Amazon and eBay sellers do not shoulder the custom duties for the buyer, as the buyer will have to pay for that. I know of Adsense publishers in England who received some techie gift goodies from Google last Christmas who were charged with duties on the items received. A buyer from the Philippines who purchases books from US-based Amazon may pay custom duties on the items received.\n\nMost of the small items that ship out are not inspected by customs, though there are countries (especially during holiday season) where they are more strict and inspect and open the packages received.\n\nHope this helps\nIsabel Isidro\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com

"Our economy will hold up just fine because, historically, (1) growing trade deficits signal improving economic conditions while (2) shrinking deficits often occur in times of economic trouble. \n\nDuring the last 30 years, the U.S. economy has on average grown about a percentage point faster, 3.5 percent vs. 2.6 percent, in years when the trade deficit expanded compared with years when it shrank. The unemployment rate on average fell 0.4 percentage points during years of rising deficits and rose 0.4 points when the deficit shrank. Manufacturing output rose much faster during years of rising trade deficits than during years of shrinking deficits.\n\nAmerica's largest trade deficits in recent decades occurred during economic expansions, its smallest deficits during recessions. It's no coincidence that as the economy shows signs of slowing down, the monthly trade deficit numbers have also begun to shrink with the economy's growth rate. \n\nAnother unfounded worry about the trade deficit is that it will saddle future generations with an unsustainable ""foreign debt."" It is true that foreign investors own about $1.5 trillion more in U.S.-based assets than Americans own in foreign assets abroad. But about half of foreign-owned assets in the United States are not debt but equity--direct investment in factories and real estate and portfolio investment in corporate stock. And the $1.5 trillion in net foreign investment in the United States is only about 16 percent of Gross Domestic Product, and 4 percent of the net wealth of all U.S. households and non-profit organizations. Net payments to finance our foreign ""debt"" were less than $20 billion in 1999, about one-fifth of one percent of GDP.\n\nAnother worry is that chronic trade deficits will spook foreign investors and undermine the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. dollar -- sending stock and bond markets and the real economy into a tailspin. The problem with that scenario is that it ignores the fact that trade deficits are linked to a strong, not a weak, dollar. The trade deficit increases the supply of dollars in the global economy, as foreign producers accept more dollars in payment for imports. But in times of economic expansion, the demand for those dollars by foreign investors seeking to buy U.S. assets is even greater. As long as foreign demand for U.S. assets remains strong, the dollar will remain high, and so will the trade deficit.\n\nThe best policy is to ignore the trade deficit, however large it may now seem, and concentrate on maintaining a strong and open domestic economy that welcomes foreign investment. As long as investors world-wide see the United States as a safe and profitable haven for their savings, the trade deficit will persist, and Americans will be better off because of it."

"try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"
"The truth is that Japan has a horrible infestation of leather helmets- football helmets, motorcycle helmets, airplane helmets.  The government realized that the only way to handle the growing epidemic was to encourage unsafe behavior(REALLY unsafe behavior) while at the same time wearing one of the dastardly items.  Thus, the Kamikaze pilot was born.  Unnoticed in the annals of history, though, are the equally deadly ""Crazy Motorcyclist"" and the "" Mad Footballer"" -phenomenon.  So, while Japan lost the ""War"" they in fact survived the real issue- they were able to decimate the leather helmet population, thus ensuring the safety of future generations to come."
Gravity affects every single object on Earth in the same way, by a pull of approximately 9.8 meters/sec squared, of course you have to take into account wind resistance, therefore an object such as a truck going off a building will drop slower than that of a baseball because the wind resistance will affect the truck more. So sand, gravel, the specific gravity is 9.8 meters/sec ( in a vaccuum, meaning where there is absolutely no air resistance but since places that this aren't normal you have to assume wind resistance.)

"One way would be to go to a local bank and ask them if they issue secured credit cards.  That would mean you deposit a sum of money in an account at their bank.  Typically the account you would open would be a CD.  It would earn interest.  They would ""lock up"" that account and offer you a credit card with a credit line of a percentage of the amount on deposit.  If you default on the credit card, they take the amount you have on deposit."

Pot\n\nEven though I do not do any illegal drugs, I have much experience in this field.  SoI will give you my best info.  \n\nYou've got your shrooms, but they are very dangerous, can cauuse liveror kidney failure.  Also there are good/bad trips.    That is going to go under Hallucinting powers. Could go to jail or prison, depending on how much you have if you sold it or whatever. The worng shrooms can make you brain dead.\n\n\n\nThen you have Acid.  Aka LSD. It is a schedule 1 drug, so prepare for jail time maybe prison if you get caught.  It makes you see stuff that is not there. You need someone with you when you take it because you will be confused and maybe paranoid.  LSD is known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.\n   Then there are opiates.  THose are fun.  FOr a while.  Bet you get hooked fast and cannot afford to continue buying and no one will give you an rx and then you have to go to treatment.\n\nMeth  Your teeth fall our, hair falls out, this all happens right away and you lose everything.\n\nCrack cocaine:  Highly addictive, gets you into lots of trouble, some people (many) cannever stop after the first smoke.  \n\nPot:  Far asI know, just makes you stupid.  Illegal as well.  \n\nThe list goes on and on.  If you want to get a high, go work out and build a sexy body, your own body produces the endorphs that make you feel high.  \n\nIf you want to break the law, go 10 oever the speed limit, or run a red light at night after you looked both ways.  Why spin the dial on your life.\n\nI guess pot is the least offensive. It is against the law though.  Unless you don't live in the USA.  \n\nI am going to give you a web page add here you can read up on all the hoest answers to your questions..\nHE SITE #\nWhat is Erowid.org? #\nErowid.org is an online library of information about psychoactive plants, chemicals, and related topics. The site is cross between a library and a journal, both archiving older historical documents and information as well as publishing new articles.\n\nWhy was Erowid started? #\nAlthough the risks and problems of psychoactives are widely discussed, it's also clear that psychoactive plants and chemicals have played a positive role in many people's lives. Unfortunately, there is a serious lack of balance in the information provided by many resources. As our culture struggles with integrating the increasing variety and availability of these substances into its political and social structures, new educational models are clearly needed. Erowid is founded on the belief that a healthy relationship with psychoactives is one grounded in balance, where use is part of an active, intellectual, physical, and spiritual life. We believe that access to information is key to creating these healthier relationships with psychoactives.\n\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org\nhttp://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.cgi?A=ListByCat&Cat0=77&x=16&y=9\nGood luck on your search

a teddy bear, they are adorable and people cuddle them, however if you are a snoopy doll, you might be a collectable and just sit there on the shelf, waiting for your day, watching the furry lovable, teddy bear get cuddled while you collect dust, sure maybe an ooohh or ahhh every once in a great while from a fan, but where is the deal love. The hug tight at night, the being drooled on and rolled over on when they fall asleep... Then as a Snoopy you sit, angry, bitter, but unable not to smile, until one day your rage and jealousy of the teddy bear take hold, and then... i don't want to be that teddy bear. So my answer is, i would prefer to be a teddy bear, unless there was a snoopy collectable in the house.

Stay away from payday lenders at all costs.... or it will end up costing you a bundle.  It sounds like such a simple thing, and their ads make them sound like they're really there for you when you need them.  But don't be swayed.  They charge incredibly ridiculous rates of interest, and if you're not careful, you can wind up in a vicious cycle with them.  Here's how:  you borrow $100 till next payday.  Then your paycheck arrives, but you don't have an extra $100 to pay back the loan.  They offer to roll it over for you.  Then you decide to take out another $50 just to get you by till next payday.  Now you owe $150 plus a whole ton of interest.  Oh yeah, and fees too.  \n\nSo what's a person to do if you're tight on cash?  Talk to your credit union or bank.  See about alternatives they have to payday loans.  Even opening a credit card will charge you less interest than using a payday lender.  \n\nThen, take a good hard look in the mirror and figure out how to cut expenses so you aren't strapped for cash.  Perhaps you could get a 2nd job for awhile to bring in some additional money.

"God. This explanation is what everyone eventually resorts to when the other answers fail. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to. \nbut...\nThe Bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much the same way the Koran, Torah, and Pali Canon offer guidance to people of other religions. If you and I could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of Islamic belief, Judaic belief, Buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? Should we wave a flag and tell the Buddhists that we have proof the Buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? Or that Jesus was not born of a literal virgin birth? Those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are metaphorical.""Sophie looked skeptical. ""My friends who are devout Christians definitely believe that Christ literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth.""""My point exactly,"" Langdon said.

so sorry to hear that your boss is holding you up on filing your taxes.  they (employers) need to follow up on getting a copy of your income to the irs and to you.  so once they figure out the w-2, they keep a copy and send a copy to the irs, and give you a copy.\nfar as i know their responsibility ends there, until they file their own taxes, but that has nothing to do with you.\nhope this helps.\ngood luck
That depends on the channel's type? For example if it is a music channel you can advertise it in music magazines and sites.\n\nYou need to disclosure more information about your TV channel to get better answers…\n\nGenerally, I suggest you advertise it in newspapers, magazines, and billboards (not radio).\nIf TV channels in your region or country are plenty you may need to segment the market you are targeting at, so that you are differentiated (creating advantages and adding value for your clients).\n\nDo market research… See how your idea sounds to people? Listen to what they need… you may get proposals on what type of channel is missing in your town or what type of channel they want.\n\nBear in mind that a TV channel is a big investment and you need to carefully plan all your steps and actions.

that really depends.\n\nif you're looking for speed a scoring cutter is the fastest way, however the cuts are not all that smooth.  In fact every now and then, you might have to discard a tile because the tile broke where it wasn't supposed to.\n\nIf you're looking for precision, a wet saw is the best, but each cut will take longer, and you'll have to dry each tile before you set it, as a wet tile might not bond properly.

This knowledge has been around for quite a while, as some tribe members in Africa actually use dip their testicles in hot water a few days before sexual intercourse as a form of birth control.\n\nHence, if you put a laptop on your lap - the heat from the battery might nullify the sperm count for a few days, but it won't really affect your fertility. That's my thought on the subject. I'm just passing on what I read in a book... =p

"First of all, I'm truly sorry for your loss. \nSecondly, I think it largely depends upon whether or not you are the executor of his will, if he had one. My advice is to contact an ""estate attorney"" as soon as you can, if you haven't already. Even if you don't have to pay it back, you will most likely have a lot of paperwork to tackle, one way or the other- an attorney can really make it easier on you.

Just like any other business, hospitals need to market themselves. they all have websites, brochures, and advertising. Most likly the marketing center you are questioning is simply a marketing department, and thay are just trying to sound more sophisticated.\n\nIt is also possible that they have a big meeting room or media center wher they put on seminars or workshops. This tool is a marketing strategy. It brings people into the hospital. If they have a really excellent area for this, they may even let the community use it for non hospital business, again, it is just to bring more people into the hospital.\n\nBringing people in for any reason helps the comfort level and familiarity with the building, the parking and the ammenities. This will make many people more confidant and comfortable in choosing that hospital when they have a medical need.

looks like they teach you how to be a real estate investor.

"""I Am the Cheese, published in 1977, was Robert Cormier's second young adult novel. It tells the story of a teenaged boy who discovers that his family is part of a witness protection program and that his parents have been keeping secrets from him all his life. As he tries to determine who and what he is, he is threatened and finally overcome by the terrifying forces of a government that is more interested in preserving its own power than in protecting one small boy. The idea for the book grew out of Cormier's reading a magazine article about the then-new federal witness protection program and his fascination with the idea of individuals struggling against an unjust society.

Too many variables to answer this well, since you don't say why you can't get a job.\n\nIf the reason is that you are under age, then you need to rely on less formal work, such as mowing lawns, contracting with neighbors on a street to pick up the litter, etc.\n\nIf the reason is that there is no employment in your area, then moving to another location, while not your first choice, may be necesary.\n\nIf you are unqualified for work, then getting a GED or whatever it is that you need that is lacking is the first order of business.\n\nIf you aren't being hired because you lack experience, then volunteering with some non-profit group (Habitat for Humanity, Humane Society, Hospital, Nursing Home, Church) will help give you someone you can at least use as a reference for dependability, honesty, etc.
"The rate of return anticipated on a bond if it is held until the maturity date. YTM is considered a long-term bond yield expressed as an annual rate. The calculation of YTM takes into account the current market price, par value, coupon interest rate and time to maturity. It is also assumed that all coupons are reinvested at the same rate. Sometimes this is simply referred to as ""yield"" for short.\n\nTo calculate it, you can use the YIELD function in Excel. (Go to Tools>Add ins and select Analysis Toolpak if the function is not listed). This function essentially determines what rate is needed to discount the future cash flows of the bond to make the present value equal to the current price."

Depending on your attitude, it can be very fun or very boring.\n* Try getting into sports. Basketball, soccer, tennis, ping pong, golf, or whatever.\n* Try to come up with more things to try :)

"Everything is negotiable.\n\nBear in mind, a GOOD agent will make the money (and more) back for you.  1% difference in commission is about $8000.  If you have a good negotiator working for you, you'll probably easily make more than the $8000 difference.  \n\nI offer commission breaks when I know I'm doing more than one 'side'.  That is, if you will let me help you find your next place, I'll cut my selling commission to you by 1%.  It's just good business.\n\nBut interestingly enough, I don't have to discount my commission very often.  The reason is because I have a full blown marketing campaign that covers ALL the bases.  If you're going to pay for a full commisssion, it should be because you're getting full service.  If you're in a very hot market, then find a discounter who will put it in the MLS.  DFW Texas isn't white hot like some parts of the country, and it actually takes a little work to get it sold.\n\nSo really it comes down to your market.  \n\nOne other negotiating tip:  Don't ""offer"" an agent.  Have them ""offer"" you.  Some of them will likely roll over on you and give you a heavily discounted rate.  Beware the ones who discount too much, too fast.  If they can't negotiate worth a darn with you, how are they going to do when a buyer's agent like me comes along!  :)\n\nGood luck."

Try to put all you energy, thoughts, motivations on something worth dealing with, that captures your attention!!!
The best way to do this is by in every day conversation, try and not use these words.  I would imagine, you have to also determine what it is that sets you off, to where you get to the situation, where you use these words as well.  It's not going to happen tommorow.. or the next day, but as you search for other words to substitute the bad ones... it will become easier
"I'm a ""he"".\n\nAnd it's really silly but when I chose the ""just curious..."" name, I thought it was just for my first question.  And now I am stuck with it.\n\nAnd yes, sheila does answer some of the most interesting questions, so I consider myself privileged to be going to the same places.\n\nAnd, is she hot?  I don't know, to be honest.  It's just that I kept seeing her name just about wherever I went at Yahoo Answers. \n\nAnd she seems to be a fun person with a great sense of humour. And I must say that by now every time I see her, I smile.\n\nSo sheila, you should know that when I asked that question about you, it was sort of spontaneous because I couldn't believe I was seeing you so much. I didn't have any views, positive or negative, about you at the time."

"On eBay,  a seller can set up an auction so that only pre-approved bidders can bid on it.  If you're not a pre-approved bidder and want to bid on such an auction, you must contact the seller and ask permission to bid.  All eBay items have a ""Ask seller a question"" link that you can use to e-mail the seller with such a request."
"Unfortunately, kids can be jerks, and bullies.  A lot of people get picked on, and you need to just ignore them, and do not give them the gratification of knowing that it bothers you.  If they don't think it bothers you, they will quit in time.\nYou can try to soften your look a little, and maybe dress an little more ""girly,"" which may help, but I don't think that you need to, unless you really want to.  You don't want to go around changing the real you, based on what some dumb kids say."
"My Dad used to be the same way. I finally got really mad at him one day and asked him. He said ""Because I want you to be the best you can be."" \n\nIt didn't make me like his nagging and yelling any better, but at least I understood why he did it, and I was better able to ignore it.  \n\nTruthfully, I secretly tried harder after that, knowing he wanted me to do my best."
When I was a kid my mom decided it would be fun to blow up a waterbed (with air) and put it in the yard for us to use as a trampoline. When you don't have much money, creativity is great.
In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote. \n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken. \n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.

"No. But get someone to help you only when you get stuck. Otherwise, try to resolve every math problem on your own.\nNo one can teach us anything.We learn everything on our own.\nTeacher can only guide us.\nYou are starting with fractions, as I did many years ago.Follow the rules given in the math book and only ask your helper for explanation when you must.The moment you ""see the light"" stop him or her and continue on your own.\nYou,as most of the people who ""hate"" math(I used to be one also),have to ""go back"" to the point where you ""lost connection"".You missed that lesson on fraction and now is time to learn it and go on to more complex problems.\nBecause I learned it all at a ""ripe age"" of 18,instead as a kid, it is still ""with me"" and I do not hate math since.\n(My English is also self-tought and I probably made good number of mistakes.

The difficult part of being employed is the employer. Once you begin working, unless you have a contract, you are at their mercy to do as they request as long as it's legal. Any business owner will tell you a job description is only a set of guidelines and is not set in stone.
If they told you it was possible when you got hired, then yes, they can.  Also if they are short handed they can as well.  Accept it gracefully.  I know you cant say you dont need the money.  And an hour and a half is nothing.  But talk to your employer and tell him/her that you have to get your kids or something right after work so working overtime is a burden for you.  Good luck.

Yes.  places like Wells fargo,  Citifinacial (who i used to consolidate)  will give u a loan even if your credit isnt good, Lord knows mine isn't.

"Thank you for the information on your situation...it's a bit easier to give good advice that will help.\n\nFirst, my ""battle cry"".  When you are about to repair your credit history, or do battle with collection agencies, knowledge of the law is your only weapon!  DO NOT fight these jerks unarmed!!!  Read the links I supplied below.\n\nAs I understand it, you got this credit card before you got married?  That's good, because they can't go after your husbands income.\n\nThe very first thing you need to do is write a letter to the collection agencies that are bothering you.  Use the sample letters in the links below.  By law, if you tell them to stop bothering you, they must stop all contact.  But be warned, you are basically telling them to either sue you or back off.  \n\nIf your debt isn't that big they will most likely leave you alone.  The credit report will remain on your records for 7 years from the time you defaulted on the last payment.  There are ways to get it removed from the records, or at least limit the impact.\n\nThey can sue you if the debt is not that old.  The ""Statute of Limitations"" varies from state to state.  Most are 6 years.  After that the can't sue you, but they can still mess up your credit history.\n\nYou are in a better situation because your debts are before you got married.  Live off your husbands credit for now.  \n\nWhen I got married, my wife came with a lot of debt baggage.  They were after her for trailer payments, and loans made with her past marriage.  She was getting 2-3 credit letters a month and was a nervous wreck.  The jerks even found my phone number and began calling us up.\n\nBut what they didn't know was.....\nI WAS ARMED!  I knew the law.  I knew how to handle these jerks!\n\nThe calls and letters stopped.  I cleaned up her credit history and now she has a credit card of her own and a good rating.  \n\nI'm not a credit counsoler, got no legal experience.  I just know where to look for information. Now you do too!\n\nWrite me if you need encouragement.  Your situation isn't bad at all."

"I don't know whats more unbelievable. The answerer or the asker. I think the asker is entitled to their opinion.

People like that should be forced to turn in their high school diploma and repeat the 12th grade."
"The war for oil is not just limited to the Middle East. It is a worldwide war that you can learn about if you watch the news carefull each night.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, new demand for electricity is outpacing the new supply of power and natural gas and raising the specter of more rolling blackouts. In the ""emerging"" economies, such as Brazil, India and especially China, energy demand is rising so fast it may double by 2020. And this only hints at the energy crisis facing the developing world, where nearly 2 billion people -- a third of the world's population -- have almost no access to electricity or liquid fuels and are thus condemned to a medieval existence that breeds despair, resentment and, ultimately, conflict. \n\nIn other words, we are on the cusp of a new kind of war -- between those who have enough energy and those who do not but are increasingly willing to go out and get it. While nations have always competed for oil, it seems more and more likely that the race for a piece of the last big reserves of oil and natural gas will be the dominant geopolitical theme of the 21st century. \n\nGranted, the United States, with its vast economic and military power, would probably win any direct ""hot"" war for oil. The far more worrisome scenario is that an escalating rivalry among other big consumers will spark new conflicts -- conflicts that might require U.S. intervention and could easily destabilize the world economy upon which American power ultimately rests. \n\nJust look at Hugo Chavez threatening to cut off the oil supply from Venezuela. This is only one small signal for the impending GLOBAL war for oil."

You just are feeling guilty about something clear your mind and them think about what mean things you have done. Fix it and you will feel better!
I know this sounds crazy, but it worked for me and everyone else I know. You need to go do your own thing. Immerse yourself in what makes you happy. Try to keep your mind off of finding a boyfriend. Let them come to you. When you do your own thing, you'll meet a guy that has the same interests as you. However, that does not mean to start doing something that doesn't really interest you because you want a new place to find a guy. Do something that honestly interests you. It might not happen right off and it may take a while but it will happen. Also, ask yourself if you need the added stress of a boyfriend and a relationship. Another thing, guys can sense when a girl is feeling desperate. Maybe you are sending off desperate vibes, and they are picking up on that. Boost your self-esteem. Guys like girls with confidence and they also pick up on the fact that you may have low self-esteem. \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean when I was talking about the low-confidence and desperate thing. I was just stating a fact, something you may want to evaluate about yourself.

The nursing home should have the resident's advocates phone number posted somewhere in the building, usually listed with the residents bill of rights. If you can't find it and don't want to ask then call the state nursing home association or the state department of health. \n\nBefore you file a formal complaint I urge you to be asolutely sure it is the act of abuse and not something beyond the staffs controll. Nursing homes are notoriusly understaffed and busy especially during the night that accidents do happen for various reasons. Do you see signs of abuse in other areas or just this incidence? Do some investigating before making the complaint please! Until you have sent more than a few intermittent hours at a nursing home you can't possibly know what constitutes abuse and what constitutes mitigating circumstances. Trust me I know from experience!

"I think you mean ""adze.""  It's a tool:\nThe tool known as the adze [pronounced adds] serves for smoothing rough-cut wood in hand woodworking. Generally, the user stands astride a board or log and swings the adze downwards towards their feet, chipping off a piece of wood, and walking backwards as they go, leaving a relatively smooth surface behind. However, in general usage, the adze can be used for other cutting operations.\n\nThe head of the adze is oriented to the haft like a hoe, or plane, and not like an axe, whose cutting blade would be perpendicular to the blade of an adze."
That depends, is it oil based or latex? Latex will rinse out at first, but if it is dry, you wanna get real hot water and soak it till the paint starts to come off, then launder, but don't dry in dryer til you are sure spot is out. Dryer will set the stain. If it is oil based paint, some thinner will get it out, but make sure as soon as you get the paint out, you wash out the thinner too. Either way, if you have already dryed it in dryer, you better fall in love with that stain, cause it's there to stay.
some probably make enough to file taxes.

Death. Of all, I find that death is one of the realities of life that children find the most weird. They cannot cope very easily with the loss of a friend, a family member or anybody close to them. Heck, even the death of a complete stranger baffles them. The dead goldfish, the tabby puss - anything that encounters with death, will completely scare the children.\n\nMost of the time, they fear that death will come to take away their remaining loved ones. The only way I see to solve this is to explain and reassure them that death is not something that should be feared, but something that should be respected; a whole new level where death is a better place for people to go to. It is a place of peace and love. In this way, children believe that death is no longer a place of sadness or sorrow and to that they hold forever...

try speaking it first in the privacy of your home.  Use a tape recorder to hear yourself, see how you sound.  If there are other ppl who speak english that you know personally try talking to them, ask how them how you are doing.  Let them correct you, its the only you are going to learn.  I am learning dutch and try speaking it at home first with my partner who is fluent.  once I feel i have it down ok i take it outside.  it helps me so thats my suggestion!  good luck!

I think we are just wired that way - if humans were the kind of species to lie back and smell the roses, we probably would still life in caves and hunt with stone spears. \nIf we do well and get something, we are happy only for a while. So if we want that happy feeling again, we obviously have to go out and try to get something else again to re-capture that feeling. Also, as we are successful and acquire something, we usually get admired (and envied) by the people around us, a rather pleasant feeling. This admiration by others probably is expressed in all kind of pro-creative ways, therefore making it likely that this trait will get passed on. \nSo it would seem that we have the whole weight of evolution weighing in against us when it comes to contendedness.
"*Shaking my furry skull* Noperz, the only guaranteed way to get a negative test is to not do the drugs. Especially pot as it will stay in your system for up to 30 days.\n\nNow mind you, there are things one can do to get false negatives, drinking lots of liquids, certain compounds sold on the market ect.\n\nProblem is, if the urine is too clear like drinking liquids will do, that is grounds for rejection and they will want another sample. With additives they test for that as soon as they become aware of the additive and then you fail for that.\nOften you are not left alone when the sample is given so cannot substitute for clean urine, dilute, or put in a negative creating chemical.\n\nWhich leaves one with the choice of before even giving the sample taking and informing the lab at collection time things like advil (for thc) which will result in a false positive even if you are clean. But at best you only delay your test.\n\nWhich gets us right back to must stay clean for the period of time it takes for the drugs to leave your system.\n\nMind you, you can do a search online for more info, but no one is gonna say ""Oh gee they now test for our product."" So buyer beware."

Sure, just look at a frozen lake - you can usually see frozen bubbles in there.  The top layer of water almost always freezes first. Any air in the water (or released into the water) naturally rises and is trapped under the top frozen layer.  When the water under the top layer freezes, you have frozen bubbles.  Look in your ice cube tray - you might just find some frozen bubbles there!
"Fibromyalgia is a ""syndrome"", not a disease. It is compromised of several co-conditions, one being that it is a neurotransmitter disorder. Here are the results of a test done on Fibromyalgia patients which proves that there is a problem.\n\nFibromyalgia pain, isn't all in patients' heads new brain study finds. \nJune 7, 2002 \nfMRI scans give first objective measure of mysterious ailment, provide road map for future study\n\nANN ARBOR, MI - A new brain-scan study confirms scientifically what fibromyalgia patients have been telling a skeptical medical community for years: They're really in pain.\n\nIn fact, the study finds, people with fibromyalgia say they feel severe pain, and have measurable pain signals in their brains, from a gentle finger squeeze that barely feels unpleasant to people without the disease. The squeeze's force must be doubled to cause healthy people to feel the same level of pain - and their pain signals show up in different brain areas.\n\nThe results, published in the May issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, the journal of the American College of Rheumatology, may offer the proof of fibromyalgia's physical roots that many doubtful physicians have sought. It may also open doors for further research on the still-unknown causes of the disease, which affects more than 2 percent of Americans, mainly women.\n\nLead authors Richard Gracely, Ph.D., and Daniel Clauw, M.D., did the study at Georgetown University Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health, but are now continuing the work at the University of Michigan Health System. In an editorial in the same issue, Clauw and U-M rheumatologist Leslie Crofford, M.D., stress the importance of fibromyalgia research and care.\n\nTo correlate subjective pain sensation with objective views of brain signals, the researchers used a super-fast form of MRI brain imaging, called functional MRI or fMRI, on 16 fibromyalgia patients and 16 people without the disease. As a result, they say, the study offers the first objective method for corroborating what fibromyalgia patients report they feel, and what's going on in their brains at the precise moment they feel it. And, it gives researchers a road map of the areas of the brain that are most - and least - active when patients feel pain.\n\n""The fMRI technology gave us a unique opportunity to look at the neurobiology underlying tenderness, which is a hallmark of fibromyalgia,"" says Clauw. ""These results, combined with other work done by our group and others, have convinced us that some pathologic process is making these patients more sensitive. For some reason, still unknown, there's a neurobiological amplification of their pain signals.""\n\nFurther results from the study were presented last year at the ACR annual meeting. The project will continue later this year at UMHS, joining other fMRI fibromyalgia research now under way.\n\nFor decades, patients and physicians have built a case that fibromyalgia is a specific, diagnosable chronic disease, characterized by tenderness and stiffness all over the body as well as fatigue, headaches, gastrointestinal problems and depression. Many patients with the disease find it interferes with their work, family and personal life. Statistics show that far more women than men are affected, and that it occurs mostly during the childbearing years.\n\nThe ACR released classification criteria for fibromyalgia in 1990, to help doctors diagnose it and rule out other chronic pain conditions. Clauw and Crofford's editorial looks at the current state of research, and calls for rheumatologists to take the lead in fibromyalgia care and science.\n\nBut many skeptics have debated the very existence of fibromyalgia as a clearly distinct disorder, saying it seemed to be rooted more in psychological and social factors than in physical, biological causes. Their argument has been bolstered by the failure of research to find a clear cause, an effe"

Most of Europe quotes in Euro - many web sites and bank can give you the current conversion rate (last I checked it was around 1.20 to 1.25 to US currency).\n\nI recently did extensively research on apartments and flats for a vacation and found that an internet search brings up TONS of websites that you can browse.  You can get a real feel for the layouts, styles, and many even show you where it is on a map!  \n\nAlso, you can go to a local bookstore and look at travel books and many of them list recommended web sites on renting -- even though this is mostly geared to short-term stays, many of the companies do long-term rentals as well.  THis is also a great resourse as many of these travel books will also give you tips on renting, why they like certain companies and the such.\n\nOnce thing I learned from my research is to pay very close attention to the rental terms, what is and is not included, deposit terms, additional agency fees for finding the apt/flat, etc.,  \n\nGood luck and I hope you find something you like!

It really depends ... are you doing real estate appraising?  art appraising?  sports memorabilia appraising?  From a real estate appraising standpoint, are you doing commercial or residential appraising?  Generally residential appraisals range from $300-$500/appraisal.  Commercial appraisals range from $500-$50,000 and up.  Residential appraisals can be completed in hours or days ... commerical appraisals usually take several days to weeks.  Additionally, each state has requirements for appraisers some require trainees to be licensed before they assist with an appraisal ... so $25 per job, that really depends on what kind of appraising you are doing.
"It reduces the demand on our natural resources, saves valuable landfill space, and creates opportunities for new industries. \n\nIf we don’t recycle, we will eventually run out of space for all of our trash.  What will we do with it then? \n\nIt saves money. Almost every trash disposal bill can be reduced by recycling more. For our entire community, this is an important economic consideration. Trash disposal costs are a drain on our local purchasing power, while recycling can generate new revenue from sales of recyclable commodities.\n\nIt saves resources and energy.\nFor every ton of paper we recycle, about 17 trees are saved that would otherwise be cut for paper pulp. Other resources that are saved include 7,000 gallons of water, 380 gallons of oil, and enough electricity to power the average home for six months.\n\nBy recycling a single aluminum can, enough electricity is saved to run a TV for six hours.\n\nBy recycling a single glass bottle, enough electricity is saved to operate a 100 watt light bulb for 4 hours.\n\nIt saves landfill space. A landfill is space which we have destroyed for almost any future use except storing garbage. The less trash we put in landfills, the more land is available for future generations.\n\nHelps to prevent pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes. \n\nIt's the law. To protect our environment, the State of California requires each city and county to recycle 50% of all solid waste by the year 2000. Reaching this goal requires the support of all households and businesses. For more information, call the Mendocino Solid Waste Management Authority at 468-9710.\n\nDid you know?\nThe average U.S. household discards each year 13,000 paper items, 500 aluminum cans, 500 glass bottles, and 1,800 plastic items.\n\nEvery week, more than 500,000 trees are used to produce the two-thirds of newspapers that are never recycled.\n\nAmerican consumers and industry throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial airfleet every 3 months.\n\nTo make a 6-foot long park bench out of recycled plastics (""plastic lumber""), it takes 1,050 recycled milk jugs.\n\nThere's lots of good reasons to recycle!! Do YOU recycle?"

Unfortunately, your credit will not improve significantly until you get spending under control. Once that's done, you need to start saving SOMETHING so an emergency doesn't kill your effort to establish good credit. Work on paying the most current judgments & collections.

Limit credit inquiries, particularly multiples in a short period of time.The rest, unfortunately, takes time. Good luck!
Careers are unique to each person and are dynamic, unfolding as a person matures. Unfortunately, turnover is high for medical assistants because of the relatively high workload and comparatively low pay raises offered. Therefore many working medical assistants will eventually elect to leave their jobs for better contracts and positions with higher potential for career advancement and pay.\n\nMedical assistants who gained experience on the job, are certified or registered, have met their continuing education requirements, and received additional training may be able to advance into higher positions, such as becoming a medical office manager. They may also qualify for a variety of other related administrative support positions where they work, such as the medical secretary, medical records clerk, or medical insurance billing and coding specialist. \n\nHowever, wherever it is that they work, their hourly wages depend on the level of experience, and often whether they are certified. \n\nSpecialty physicians often can afford to pay more than a family physician, because they earn more themselves. Medical assistants working in the back office (clinical areas) usually earn a little more per hour than their front office counter parts (admin/reception area). Florida medical assistants earn more than those in South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia. It all depends... \n\nLearn more about this subject at

"Obviously, there is a minimum population beyond which there are simply not enough people to make up a functioning country.  Beyond that, there needs to be enough people to have a fully functional economy.  That is, the major professions and trades must be adequately represented, as well as entrepreneurs and investors, support staff and other service workers, etc.  \n\nOnce there are enough to run the country, you start to see the disadvantages of too much population:  pressure on natural resources and infrastructure, housing and job scarcity, crowding causing delays in transportation, retail trade, etc.  Overpopulation also means a higher percentage of non-productive consumers than the system can most efficiently accommodate.  This causes pressure to create bureaucracy to control the excess population, including the increased crime rate caused by crowding.\n\nI do not know of any studies of what the optimum population is for a given type of geography under a given level of developments, etc., but most of the ""civilized"" world is overcrowded rather than too sparsely populated.  The only exceptions, like Canada, tend to be those in rather extremes of physical conditions.\n\nEnough to get you started?"

Having read your last question, the simple answer is yes. However, if you are actually trading, you may find that certain stocks fluctuate to the point that the share price may rise by the time your trade is completed.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't reference the last question, as most people will make the decision whether or not to answer your question based upon the text they see in the list of questions.
Dream interpretation usually is something that requires a personal perspective on the life of the dreamer.  There are, however, some basic ideas that can be applied to certain dream icons.\n\nIn most cases, dreams of being chased means that there is something in your life that you are not dealing with or confronting, instead you are running away from it despite knowing, conciously or unconsiously, that whatever it is will not be resolved by running away and will eventually catch up to you.

"Start small. Set aside a portion of cash/savings you are willing to risk. It is highly unlikely you will much or all of its value, especially if you invest in a large corporation like Coca Cola or Anheuser Busch. Buy a book or books (or research on the Web) 'How to Invest in the Stock Market"" so you become familiar w/ investing terms. \n  Open an account w/ a broker such as E-Trade or Ameritrade, its easier than you think, and transfer the money into the account. Its free and I am pretty sure that uninvested money earns interest (not much 2-3%). Now where these brokers make their money is when you buy and sell stocks. E-Trade charges 14.99 for each trade regardless if its 1 stock or 100, so be careful, especially if your nor investing a whole lot of money, you don't lose your 'profit' to commissioning fees. If you buy stock you should carefully research the company you are buying into and be prepared to hold on to that stock for the long term. Short term fluctuations in the stock (especially losses) can make you nervous and may make you want to 'cut your losses'. Stick with your choice. \n  I was like you about the Stock Market. The majority of my investments are in mutual funds and bonds. I invest in the market as a 'hobby', its fun to track your stocks and try to beat out the big guys. I have made money over the last few years (still gotta keep the day job though) and have learned a few lessons the hard way.\n  1) Don't 'risk' more than your comfortable with to start. If you can't sleep because your worried about your Yahoo stock, your in too deep.\n  2) Open a brokerage account. If you are really nervous use an established brokerage house like TD Waterhouse or Merrill Lynch, though they want a large opening stake, usually around $5G, to open an account. They will offer advice on stocks but the brokers don't always have YOUR best interest in mind.

Don't choose a field based on prospective money.  Things have a funny way of not working out as you expect. Besides, all a degree does is tell someone is you can learn something.  Do what interests you.  If you don't like it, change.

If you mean a man and wife (who are in the same family), then yes, by all means.\nIf you mean two second cousins (who are usually allowed to be married by law), then once again, yes.\nIf you mean brother and sister or parent and child, then it is never a good idea and is illegal in most places.  The child will probably be normal.  Only continued interbreeding (over several generations) will lead to problems.

Well that would depend on the type of claim you have, and where the file is being handled. Your best bet is to have  claim number handy, and contact 866-622-7296, M-F 7:00am to 7:45 PM, and Sat. 08:00am to 4:30 pm.

"Yes, but not the Christian god.  He was a pantheist (believing, to put it simply, that nature itself is God and there is no supernatural being seperate from it).  He worshipped the beauty and perfection of the cosmos rather than any particular deity.\n\nIn his own words:""A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, of the manifestation of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty - it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this sense alone, I am a deeply religious man.""\n\nHe actually hated it when people thought that he was religious in a traditional Christian sense, saying: ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it."""

I'm using a 529 plan from Utah.   There are multiple options.  Try this website.
"In the US, you have more rights than duties. In general the US was founded upon the idea that anything not specifically given to government was retained by the citizens.\n\nYou list three disimilar situations. \n\n1 ""To say something 2 some1 who parks in a handicap space & the person is not handicap.""\n\nIn my community a city police car on a non-emergency situation was ticketed by the State Police. This was in accordance with the law. It was done more as a publicity stunt than anything else, but it showed the community reaction to the situation.\n\n2) ""To say something to a parent who spanks or yell at they;re child or kids in public""\n\nYou have an right for saying something in a non-hostile way if you just don't like it. You have a duty if you feel it is abusive and harmful. Better be willing to go to court to back it up though, because among 300,000,000 people there are wide variations regarding what is abusive and harmful and what is not.\n\n3) ""To say something to a mother who's nursing her baby in public""\n\nAgain, you have the right..... but what do you want to say? There is in itself nothing wrong with this action and a lot to recommend it if done in a demure and careful manner. You certainly don't have any duty here. It's considered healthy and medically recommended. Most women would prefer to do it in private but when privacy is not available it is not shameful. \n\nAnd you said ""or do I shutup & look the other way or mind my own business?""\n\nI wouldn't say to do that. What I suggest is that you pay attention, develop an informed and researched opinion, avoid expressing hostility by developing tact, and talk and observe enough to know the variations between your family's and your communities values and the values of the larger world. Then..... think about it and make your own unprejudiced decisions. The world is your business. You can choose to be part of it, or to judge it."

Law school is only a glorified trade school. Ultimately you should pursue something that you truly enjoy. Do not be persuaded by the supposed mystique associated with being a lawyer, it is based out of ignorance. Also, do not believe law school placement office statistics, they are greatly over exaggerated. As much as half a law school class from an average law school will not be lawyers. Think about that before you spend the money, time and effort. I am a lawyer with an LL.M. and a good but not great job and I feel very fortunate. I could have easily done as well if not better getting an MBA.
Just be frank to your boyfriend that you're not happy already with his company...but think many times if your best guy friend really cares for you or are you just pretending that he cares for you...?Your boyfriend seemed to respect you in any way he wanted because as what you said he just only hugs you and nothing more..\nI really don't know the whole story between you and your boyfriend. But maybe he's just asking you how long you could handle your relationship even if there are so many temptations around..Honey, if you're going to decide on what to do, just be careful to avoid regrets ok!

The Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is the largest of the toothed whales and is believed to be the largest toothed animal to ever inhabit the planet. (The baleen blue whale is larger, and invertebrates such as the lion's mane jelly fish or the Portuguese man of war may be longer.) The whale was named after the milky-white substance spermaceti found in its head and originally mistaken for sperm. The Sperm Whale's enormous head and distinctive shape, as well as its central role in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, have led many to describe it as the archetypal whale. Partly due to Melville, the Sperm Whale is commonly associated with the mythological Leviathan of Biblical lore.\n\nHistorically the Sperm Whale has also been known as the Common Cachalot. The word cachalot is originally Portuguese (cachalote), probably coming from cachola, a colloquial term for head. Sperm Whales were hunted until recently in the Portuguese atlantic archipelago of Azores.

Here's the BIG question. And however I have another question in return to that one: what do you consider effective? Do you mean martially effective? or effective at clearing your mind or bringing inner peace? Martial Art = The art of war. What makes up a martial art: Percussion (striking), Projection (throwing), Immobilization (joint locks), and Armament (weaponry). Here are some examples of different systems:\n\nKarate: Okinawan. Covers Percussion. Civil Art. Kara- meaning open or empty depending on translation. -te originally meant Chinese Hand but they later changed it to just hand after the Chinese were driven out. Derived from White Crane Kung Fu. Believes in hardening the body against strikes and striking hard is the key.\n\nKung Fu: External Chinese. Most cover percussion, projection, and armament, with a few covering immobilization as well. Usually either martial or civil art. There are SO many systems within the term kung fu that it is hard to describe this system effectively. To say the least the best Kung Fu I have seen was in Dallas, and was translated to the Water-Fire Kung Fu.\n\nAikido / Aiki-jujutsu: Japanese. Covers immobilization with slight touch on projection. Civil Art. Was originally derived from Nihongo Jujutsu or Japanese Jujutsu (honestly I hate that I have to specify WHICH jujutsu compared to Brazilian or American… as if you would get an French taco or Russian sushi). Aikido has sadly become one of the snobbiest “styles” out there and they insist that what they do would work in real combat, although only about 10% of EVERYONE who is involved with that system knows what they’re doing. Though I will admit those that do, can do some beautiful Aiki.\n\nJudo: Japanese. Covers projection. Sport Art. Another derivative of Nihongo Jujutsu. A sport derived from the throwing system used in Japan’s combat. As with all sports, there are certain things that they threw out as “illegal moves” due to their effectiveness therefore making the “style” weaker.\n\nBrazilian: Japanese origin. Covers a portion of Immobilization and Projection. Martial Sport. This “style” was made famous by the Gracie family after they were originally taught by a Japanese man who refused to show them any more than the grappling section of Jujutsu. So they concentrated on the art of ground fighting. Most people that do Brazilian are extremely competitive and aggressive in nature.\n\nTaekwondo: Korean. Percussion. Sport Art. This is a primarily kicking “style” and is considered one of the most famous “styles” in use. Another system that is sport / competition based they rely heavily on flexible and fast legs. Originally a derivative from a certain school of Karate which name eludes me at this moment.\n\nKrav Maga: Israeli. Um… Percussion? Military wannabe. I REALLY don’t suggest this system unless you’re looking for a Billy Blanks on steroids kinda feel. This system was built to teach the foot soldiers of Israel a quick, brutal and less than effective hand-to-hand fighting method in a matter of a week, so seriously, don’t bother.\n\nThose Russian arts: Mainly knife junkies who think they know what they’re doing. More flashy than anything else, don’t fall for the hype.\n\nPilipino: Mostly Stick and knife, and they are not for the faint of heart, although not much art to the system, it seems those whom you can find who actually know what they’re doing are pretty good with a knife and stick but that’s it.\n\nMMA: Mixed martial arts. Probably the worst thing that has ever happened to martial arts besides Krav maga. The concept of mixing martial arts is taking a system that is inferior and mixing it with another inferior system to hopefully make up for the gaps left by the other one. For example: Karate doesn’t have Immobilization, so lets throw in Aikido and Brazilian, and those don’t have projection so lets throw in Judo, and all of those don’t have armament so lets throw in Pilipino. \n\nTh

"To be honest, I can't stand people of ANY color who think every issue, at its core, is about the suppression of blacks by whites.\n\nSome people just want to turn everything into ""black people v. white people"", focusing on the conflict instead of finding a resolution.

He writes that black people make better Christians than white people because that race has suffered more ... what bunk!\n\nTurn your own question around to yourself.

Sexy Eyes and a Nice Smile are my 2 main things, But the things that men like could change not only from one guy to the next but also within that same guy. For example if I meet a woman who doesn't have a Nice smile...... But she has nice legs and Sexy eyes, Or she just has a nice butte and ample breasts it may still get my attetion..... Sometimes it's not specific things men prefer but what combination of things will attract the guy. Women shouldn't feel the need to have all the things guys like because the combination of what you do have could attract most guys anyway.

Bring it up to them, and ask them why exactly are they doing that to you?  If they are not understanding what you are talking about.  Then explain to them what your feelings are, and tell them if they keep doing it, that your going to stop hanging out with them.  If you have already told them your feelings, then stop hanging out with them and let them see that your serious about your feelings.  A true friend is not going to do that kind of stuff anyways.

"""Personnel"" is an antiquated term for referring to what is now commonly called ""Human Resources"". The Human Resources department does not the decision on who should be hired or fired. This is usually left up to the department that the employee works in. Human Resoucres screen applicants for positions, ensure compliance with employment laws, administer training and development programs, manage employee benefits, and perform internal investigations (like sexual harassment claims). They also are involved in recruiting and they do research to ensure that their compensation programs are in line with the competition. They also maintain permanent records for all employees and are usually the ones that answer questions. They may also maintain the company's organizational chart and may maintain a database of the company's various jobs, their descriptions, and their performance requirements."
Jeez, I'm glad you asked that question. I still like the paper bags better than the plastic ones.  Whenever I go grocery shopping, I ask the bagger to load the groceries in double paper bags.Usually they have them but sometimes they don't.

"My only suggestion to resolve this matter for ""free"" is to go down to your local library. They should have all of the newspapers on microfilche or microfilm and from there you could begin searching for your fathers death notice or any info that was published. Once you figure the exact date and time then you can attempt to contact your local city hall or county clerks office and request the death certificate. It is all part of public record. If there were any criminal charges you can also check with the court system in your area and they will guide you in the right direction."

A: A bell tower.\n\nQ: Why a bell tower?\n\nA: Why not? Guys, being guys, always want to build towers. In fact, the region around Pisa was famous for them. But the best excuse for a tower they could come up with in the 12th century was: We could put bells on it! Whereas we 20th-century sophisticates, with our mature grasp of the architectonic possibilities, would be more likely to say: What a great place for a satellite dish.

In computer security technology, a virus is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. A computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of a virus into the program is termed as an infection, and the infected file (or executable code that is not part of a file) is called a host. \n\nIn the context of computer software, a Trojan horse is a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software. The term is derived from the classical myth of the Trojan horse. In the siege of Troy, the Greeks left a large wooden horse outside the city. The Trojans were convinced that it was a gift, and moved the horse to a place within the city walls. It turned out that the horse was hollow, containing Greek soldiers who opened the city gates of Troy at night, making it possible for the Greek army to pillage the city. Trojan horse programs work in a similar way: they may look useful or interesting (or at the very least harmless) to an unsuspecting user, but are actually harmful when executed.\n\nA computer worm is a self-replicating computer program, similar to a computer virus. A virus attaches itself to, and becomes part of, another executable program; however, a worm is self-contained and does not need to be part of another program to propagate itself. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_virus

You could become an assistant to an agent.  Agents are independant contractors, and are therefore not employess that recive standard paychecks.  I'm sure your broker wouldn't mind holding you commission checks and cutting them up weekly. I know I wouldn't mind.  I'd happily put your earnings into an intrest bearing accout and cut you a draft from it every week.  You make what money you earn, you are after all a sales person.  Try stepping up your selling a bit, you'll get morre that way than you can on any weekly pay job.  Or maybe just find a diffrent career.
Usually the contract signed would cover this, and most of the time the answer would be YES, you are expected to pay the moving allowance back.  However, that is usually prorated, so you'd only have to pay back the 1 month worth.  Check the contract you signed for specifics.\n\nThat said, if a company fires you they probably won't bother collecting the moving allowance.  If there's something wrong with an employee, many companies prefer to cut their losses and get rid of the employee as cleanly as possible.  Tying up additional resources to recoup a small amount of money (comparatively) is usually not worth their while.  But you can't count on this.  Assume the company will do whatever the contract says they will do.
Is a leasing agent just the person who finds the tenants? If so you probably need a property management company so that they can keep an eye on it as well as handling maintenance and calls as they arise. You will have to probably pay between 7%-10% of the gross rent plus 50%-100% to find a tenant, but then you wont have to try and manage it long distance. \n\nUnless you have friends in the area willing to drop by and do inspections while handling maintenance (replacing the furnace filters is usually a good reason 2-4 times a year) then you will likely need help of this sort.\n\nIf you are already using a management company and just want to fill it with a leasing agent then you may be better able to find the tenant you want. A leasing agent will not mind waiting for the right person while the management company would tend to have an incentive to take the first person to come along. (The good ones will avoid the temptation but it is still there because of how they get paid.)\n\nAnother possibility might be to find someone willing to do a lease w/option to buy so they are responsible for the maintenance and will take better care of it. It might not fit with your plans for the house though.

You dont need to, however a helicopter charter sounds like you need some capital to begin, unless you are a pilot and plan to rent the helo.  Most banks will require this feasibility study so that they dont make a risky loan.  However if you are financing the whole deal yourself, you know what will work and what will not, you know if you can do it.  So why would you need that also?
No, life is not that easy.

Good advice is always certain to be ignored, but that's no reason not to give it.
Hello there,\n\nI think it would have been better if you would have provided the context of your letter. Now, I don't know whether it is a letter from a boss to his/her employees or from a father/mother to his/her son/daughter or any other.\n\nNevertheless, I will try and answer your question with some of my ideas-\n1- Put a suiable heading. It would be better if it is a famous quote or something. You can search for a good quote here-\nhttp://www.knowledgefound.com/context/index.cfm\n\n2- Don't sound like a preacher. Try to be friendly and warm.\n\n3- Use simple & understandable language. The reader should not need a dictionary to read your letter.\n\n4- There are some great father-to-son letters written by some great authors and philosophers. You can search for such literature in a public library. You can also search for them on the internet. \n\n5- Use some real life examples to substantiate your point.\n\n6- Don't wander away from the topic. Your every new sentence should be in continuation to the last one.\n\nI hope I helped you.\nGood Luck. :)
Whit patience.

"As I am sure you can appreicate, Northern China is a pretty big area, so if you don't mind I've centred on the city of Harbin (neat the border with Mongolia). Well, the first thing is ""swings and roundabouts"" and perhaps a place that should bid for a future Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year. In January, the average temperature is -26°C (in other words, frigid) and in July it can get as hot at 29°C leading to an annual range of 55°C and as for rainfall, well, it gets a good soaking in the summer but in the winter it's as dry as a desert."

Is there an artisan market in your area? Or in a nearby city? In Portland, OR, there's an open air Saturday market where local artisans & craftmakers sell their wares.

If so, perhaps teach a class at an adult education school near you. \n\nDo you have your own online store? That could be another option for you.\n\nHope that helps!

I was less than 2 and a half, Because my brother was born when I was three.

I'm not sure of exactly what you're asking, but I think what you're asking is for suggestions on what you might write in a cover letter in order to land your first job ever, or your first job in a new industry.\n\nThe short answer is...it depends. If you have experience in another industry and want to switch industries, talk about how skills you used in your other jobs can be used in the job you are seeking (You should really research the job/industry you are trying to switch to so that you can really target the right skills and explain how you will add value).\nIf you are pursuing your first job ever, you should focus on demonstrating your character traits and how you've shown them in other arenas.  If you are hard-working, then you might want to talk about all of the organizations you held a leadership role in while in school, and your excellent GPA.  If you are an excellent communicator, talk about your grades in English, your work on the school newspaper.  \n\nIf you are in a position to do it, pursue an internship.  Most companies offer only college credit, but some do offer a small stipend. Internships are great because the employer knows that he/she will be getting mostly students with no work experience, and that's fine, because that is the point of an internship.\n\nSo, to sum this up...\nYou should begin your letter by introducing yourself and telling the employer what type/title of position you are seeking.  Then, explain why you want to work for their company and what you offer.  Highlight the skills you believe make you a great candidate.  Then, ask for an interview by either indicating that you have attached a resume for their consideration, or that you will be available for interview on (date) and can be reached by phone or email (include address).

If you're going to a hospital that receives federal funding, they are legally obligated to provide emergency services whether or not you can pay.  The social worker at the hospital should be able to tell you what payment plans are available to you.  The important thing is to get your wife to a hospital right away when the contractions start. Pack a suitcase with a few days' worth of clothing for her and basic hygiene supplies.  Keep it by the door, ready to go.  If you really can't afford a hospital, you might be able to find a licensed midwife who will deliver the baby at home.

1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others. \n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area. \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. \n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website.\n\n6. Measure the ROI carefully of your banner or pay per click campaigns

The best thing I can tell you is to make yourself interact with people more. The best thing I ever did was get a job as a sales person and having to deal with the public everyday. It helps build your conversation skills and soon you will find that it is much easier to carry on conversation. You can also consider volunteer work with the elderly or children. They usually love to have someone to talk with and have some attention. Hope this helps!

On-line sites are never very accurate.  I would not recommend cheating in any situation, but you'll certainly get busted by using any of them.

It depends on what language(s) you are studying to find the best dictionary.\n\ndictionary:  www.wordreference.com (There is also a downloadable toolbar)\n\ntranslation:  www.babelfish.altavista.com\n\nwww.freetranslation.com
titmouse, common name for members of the Paridae, a family of passerine birds, which includes the tits, titmice, and chickadees. They are small, active birds with short, pointed bills and strong legs. Their soft, thick plumage is colored in grays and browns, occasionally highlighted by black and white or blue and yellow. Titmice are found chiefly in the Northern Hemisphere and also in Asia and Africa. They are adaptable and can be taught to perform tricks. In the wild, titmice travel in mixed flocks with nuthatches, creepers, kinglets, and woodpeckers, feeding mostly on small insects but also on seeds, fruits, and berries. Typical of the family are the blackcapped chickadee, Parus atricapillus, of the NE United States, the nearly identical Carolina chickadee of the South, and the similar willow tit of Europe and the British Isles. Some titmice have crests, e.g., the crested tit of Eurasia and the tufted titmouse, Lophophanes bicolor, a mouse-gray bird with rust side patches common in the E United States. These typical titmice nest in tree cavities; the long-tailed tits weave complex bag nests. To this group belongs the Javanese pygmy tit (3 in./7.5 cm long, most of it tail); the bush tits of the American West are closely related. A third group, the penduline tits, are named for their hanging bag nests; the only American species is the western verdin. Titmice are classified in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, class Aves, order Passeriformes, family Paridae.

Advertising pays to have a product presented to the public. Sponsorship pays the entire cost, or contributes towards the cost of an event.

The public display, or advertising of the product, is a direct benefit returned from the sponsoring the event.
"Well it actually happens in all states. It's supposed to work like this:\n\nYou don't own the bottle that the drink is in when you buy it. That's right- you're borrowing it. The 5 cents you pay is for deposit. The state expects you to give it back- to a recycling center, that is. Once you do that, they give you your 5 cents back. \n\nYour 4-cent back deal is not sanctioned by the state. Assumedly, whatever center you give it back to charges 1 cent for the service.\n\nI was thinking as I was answering this question: ""Why then, does the state not give you the money when you put the bottles in the recycling bin outside your home?"" I assume the answer is similar to the 4-cent back answer: That the county, by picking it up, is charging you the 5 cents for the service. Why, then, is it required in some places? Because the requirement is that you don't put the bottle in the trash, not that you HAVE to use their service to get rid of them."

The best forex course out there is no course at all! I came to forex knowing how to read charts from trading stocks. All I had to do was read the material that the forex dealer gave to me on the basic rules of forex, and I applied all the other technical charting stuff I knew before and easy as that I was pulling a good income from forex.\n\nMind you, you will need to have a trading plan with planned exits to take profits and cut losses.\n\nIn short the best forex course is none at all! I learnt forex trading from learning a lot about the basic technical indicators, candlesticks, experience and finally from simple forex articles.\n\nGood Luck!

First you need to determine what you want. Do you want him back? Also, you need to know why he broke up with you and is this same issue going to be a problem in the future. Also, you need to understand his motivation for wanting you back. Is it because he really likes you or is it because he couldn't find anyone else? You don't want to be a fall-back relationship, but if this guy is really a good guy and just had some issues to work out, then I would say you should, but I don't know the whole situation. Ultimately, you need to decide if this guy is worth the time. And by you asking what you should do seems to inferr that you already know that he is not right, but you are trying to find validation for your feelings.

For in-depth information about the limousine service business, I suggest you check out the following books (either borrow them from your library or buy them from your favorite bookstore):\n\n1. Wheels of Gold: A Complete How-To Guide for Starting a Million Dollar Limousine Business http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974580503/powerhomebizguid\n2. How to Succeed in the Limousine Business http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN//0971119104/powerhomebizguid\n\nIn terms of legal requirements, the State of Colorado has outlined the requirements a limousine service operator must do. It may not be the same in your own state, but I reckon they will almost be similar, if not the same. Look at the list so you can know what to expect in terms of required limo specifications, trade name registration, insurance requirements, and other requirements (see link below).\n\nGood luck!\nIsabel Isidro\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com

It helps if you want to build your resume quickly.  But it's always best to at least draft your resume yourself first because you know yourself best.\n\nBelow are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.

Ken Roberts......... what can be said about this guy? He's a master at selling trading educational tools with astronomical profit margins. He steers average people towards really risky investments as well.\n\nHaving said all that. It was Ken Roberts who first gave me a glimpse into the life of a trader. I have read similar stories from other traders as well. After I bought his fist course, I became a qualified I.A. and spent several years working on the street. Since then I've learned to trade well with more risk and I have insane returns.\n\nI honestly believe that Ken Roberts looked at what William O'Neil was doing in the eighties and saw a massive market. Ken Roberts Co. is an over priced, more risky, and less educational knock off of the William O'Neil Co.\n\nI don't have an opinion on TOVI. Hope this helps.

try setting off bug bombs, be sure to open all closet and cabinet doors, dresser drawers, medicine chests etc... this will result in having to do alot of laundry and dishes, but living roach free will be worth it. Also, keeping dishes done, and food crumbs and spills cleaned up will help keep them from returning. You could also set out boaric acid, it kills roaches too.  If after all this you still have roaches, you may have to call a professional. Good Luck, I hate roaches.
Definitly yes. Others may make remarks and tease you about there being more and that just shows their ignorance in the matter. Don't waste a good friendship by listening to others. I have found that most of my life, men are the best friends I ever had. They aren't judgemental as some women can be and I don't have to put up with the jealousy that women seem to come across with, unless its their girlfriend or wife,lol. That is when I back off. No need in causing problems where it can be avoided. A trick to the friendship is to include the partner in the friendship where possible.

Here's part of the poem which inspired ladies to meet for tea and wear red hats.\n\nWARNING\nby Jenny Jacobs\n\nWhen I am an old woman I shall wear purple\nWith a red hat which doesn't go and doesn't suit me.\nAnd I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves\nAnd satin sandals, and say we've no money for butter.\nI shall sit down on the pavement when I'm tired\nAnd gobble up samples in shops and press alarm bells\nAnd run my stick along the public railings\nAnd make up for the sobriety of my youth.\n==========================================\nBut maybe I ought to practice a little now?\nSo people who know me are not too shocked and surprised\nWhen suddenly I am old, and start to wear purple.

A friend of mine is that way.  Buy, buy, buy on ebay!  One time she was online for a really long time, didn't realize it and the only way she figured out how long she was on was because when the phone bill came she had a bill that was over $300 on one day to one number.  Apparently, by some fluke her dial-up aol phone number somehow got switched from her local number to a long distance number.  Big time ouch!

The best thing to do for any resume is personalize each one you send for the specific job and company you are applying to.  You can check the company website (usually they will have a careers page) to try to find out more about what their interests and policies are regarding potential employees, and make the decision for each application. \n\nIn general, however, full disclosure is best, so if a company does check your transcripts, you will not be called into question.

The Landlord is responsible. If repairs are made properly,then the mice can't get in. If he refuses to do his job,or complains to you about housekeeping,or what-have-you,then file a complaint with the Board of Health.

Hey. Im a tattoo artist so this is a pretty easy answer. As you where being tattooed you may have noticed how you where a mess with tattoo ink. Sometimes when being tattooed the ink sticks to the skin and keeps the tattoo artist from seeing that its not tattooed in the skin but just stuck on the outside. It can also be just the way you healed. Black ink is tricky and harded to see then lighter colors. Thats why when tattoo artist's are starting out they should do a lot of blackwork. If you can color in black then you can color in anything. Almost all studios offer free touch-ups within a year of your tattoo. Black also fades easy to so SUNBLOCK SPF 30 for the summers and tanning beds. \n\nwww.studiomaxx.com

Some of the medical community still don't know what triggers the onset of this disease. It happens at any age and can be found to be in family lines and not in others. A medical exam is your best bet. There are lots of meds out there to help get through it. Although some meds can cause side effects that are worse than the actual symtom. Consult a profressional. Its the best and safest method.

You are not stuck up and vain.  If that is truly your attitude about it, then you are pretty confident in yourself and it doesn't matter what anyone else says to you.  That is good that you are not afraid of them and you don't have time for their words.  How many teen girls really do what they say they're going to do?  Please, for some reason when they run their mouth to and about you it makes them feel good about themselves.  Even if you did do something mean to one of them, so what, look how they're acting.  Young girls are just trying to find their own identity and where they belong so that is why they feed off of the negativity, it makes them feel good about themselves.  It is so immature and unattractive.  Don't feed into it and don't allow them to make you afraid.  I know you probably aren't but I'm just saying be confident.  P.S. Remember how fustrating this is for you, in the future make sure you don't get caught up in the drama when their attention shifts to someone else.

variable interest rate: A variable interest rate is based on fluctuating rates in the banking system, such as the prime rate. For example, if on January 1, the prime rate was 6 percent and your credit card's variable rate formula was the prime rate plus 9.9 percent, your interest rate would be 15.9 percent (see prime rate).\n\nprime rate: The interest rate banks charge for loans to their biggest and highest-rated customers. The prime rate changes based on the demand for money and the rate the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank charges to its member banks. It is used as a major economic indicator.

It depends on society.  In western cultures, generally 18 or older, preferably after being married.  In reality in these cultures, many have lost it in their teenage years to boyfriends/girlfriends.  In other cultures, women are married as young as 10 to men and lose their virginity then.  It is tradition and the way things are.  So it really varies depending on who you ask.  I lost mine at the age of 21 to a girlfriend.  When the time is right, you will know and that is when you will lose it.
F.O.B.(Free On Board) and C.I.F. (Cost, Insurance and Freight) are standard terminology refering to different types of shipping terms. F.O.B. means the seller delivers to the shipping port and the buyer must cover transportation and insurance costs. Same goes for C.I.F., except that seller arranges for insurance and freight to the DESTINATION port. Thus, F.O.B. value reffers to cost of the merchandise at the factory, while C.I.F. value refers to the cost of the merchandise delivered in Malaysia.

Condoms are definitely NOT 100% safe against pregnancy or any STD's. They aren't 100% safe because they can break or slip off during intercourse or they can have a flaw (tiny hole) from when they were manufactured. People use them because they do offer some protection (very little protection against pregnancy), but they should be used in combination with other protection. =-)

Typing in all caps is the online equivalent to yelling, and therefore bad manners. All caps are also harder to read. Here's why...\n\nOnce we have mastered reading (not sounding out words letter by letter), we recognize words by their shape rather than by the order of the letters. Think about it...you read whole words, not individual letters. When words are typed in all caps, they lose their shape -- that is, they become rectangular. The reader has to revert to reading them one letter at a time, hence slowing them down.\n\nGraphics designers use this as a tool to draw attention by slowing down a reader. It is an effective tool when used properly.

Yes every town and every state has low income housing.  First there are the apartments that bas your rent on your income.  They take 10% of your income and that is what your rent is.  BUT you can only make sooo much money to qualify for it.  Then there is section 8 and that is where you find your own house, and the landlord has to agree to accept rent payment from the state u r in.  Alot of landlords like this cuz they r guaranteed to get their rent on time every month but alot do not like it because the house you pick has to have an inspection- all windows have to have locks and 2 exits- back and front door.  Things like that.  For section 8 they put your name on a list and u have to wait for your name to come up.

Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some guidelines:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.

Statistic are important to the insurance companies, because they are in the business of selling insurance to protect people or events which are at low risk.They have to know statistically the potential of how many years a person is expected to live before selling him life insurance. The same thing applies to events. If you work in a job where you might get killed, or maimed easily, they are not going to sell you any insurance too quickly. They may jack up the ins. premiums to compensate for the high risk.

I am answering this because you are so insistent and somehow have that desperate sound to your lil’ voice, so please listen up well.\n\nStart with talent agencies for kids, go for auditions, do some local commercials (TV, Radio if you have a good voice, etc.) and theater, etc.   But I would say at your age your biggest challenge is convincing your parents to support you with your dream of becoming an actor.   Having said that, I think your best option is to stay in high school, take as many acting classes as you can (at school, local theaters, private lessons, etc.) read up about it on the Internet as much as you could, get some experience under your lil' wings by doing small parts, etc.   ...Very few people ever make it in this cutthroat competitive field.   You don't need to rush it, if you have the inborn talent/are really good at it, and work hard at it by paying your dues, you can be sure it will eventually come to you.   Couple of important issues:\n\n1- Do you love acting because it is your calling in life, or because you wanna be famous?   If you think acting is your free ticket to fame and riches think again and save yourself a lot of unnecessary headache.  If you love acting because it makes your lil' soul happy then why not start with smaller roles in local productions and build your way up?  That's exactly how some of the most famous actors in Hollywood were discovered. Like I said, if you are any good, somebody will eventually know about it and will give you an offer.   Also it does NOT hurt to convert your parents to your camp, by trying to be as good a student as you can possibly be in your other school subjects - that way they are liable to take you and your acting wishes/dreams much more seriously. \n\n2- But PLEASE, whatever you do, don't think about running away from home at your age  (or any age) to become an actor somewhere!  That would be the worst decision of your life EVER; even if you were 18 or 21, which you are NOT.   So be patient, learn as much as you could, pay your dues, try to be a decent human being and good things will come to you in good time.   Good Luck Dear!

Hi, I don't know if you know and accept karma theory. If your being good and things are happening bad to you then just take it as all the consequences of your previous bad deeds are being washed away, and it will make you a better human being. Also it gives a nice opportunity to fine tune your self and see if you are really good and correct even the minutest of defects in you. Yes i understand what you say, i have been through such feelings, but i am sure in the end, if your good then for sure if you look at a bigger picture, you will definitely realize that whatever is happening is happening for your own good, but that may be a result in the long run.\nbest regards

Globalization definitely offers a lot of opportunities for individuals who understand the new rules of competition and who understand that cyberspace will be the next goldmine.\n\nIt's a mega opportunity for those who make an effort to understand technologies and use them in order to reach markets worldwide. The advantages of globalization include the ability to create all kinds of new products and services by partnering with other people that you reach through cyberspace and also the opportunities to market your products and services to a worldwide and potentially limitless market.\n\nIt affects people’s career by giving them more power, but the thing that is necessary for people to benefit from that new power is a change in mindset. Career people for example have to take charge of their careers and begin to take responsibility for everything that happens in their career. In other words, they have to consider their career as a business. They have to begin to act and think like the president of their personal services corporation, as Brian Tracy puts it.

It keeps the naive on their toes, and draws the legal line. I don't use drugs, and I don't like the thought of cocaine being next on the legalization bill.

"A house we lived in during the mid 1970's was already 85 years old and people had died in it several times in all those years. Lots of unusual and strange things happened while living there. Also the house we just moved from last year had things happen in it. The first night there (only my husband and I) someone calling ""Mom! Mom!"" woke me up, but no one else was in the house. Also when I was taking my plate of food into the dinning room to eat, I glanced in the window and saw a reflection of a young man, looked to be about 20 or so. No one ever wore perfume or cologne or used any cleaning products with smells because of my asthma and every so often would get a heavy smell of like a man's after shave or cologne. Even people who were visiting would smell the after shave sometimes. And lots more stuff. The house was new when we bought and moved into it."
The sense would be that it can be really cool sometimes, eventhoug it doesn't seem to make any sense.

Keep in touch with your engineer friends who have jobs.  Sometimes, they need extra help on projects, and with them knowing you and your available skills, that can give you a direct route for being hired by the company.\n\nAlternately, apply your engineering skills to tasks you can achieve right now, and build your skills.\n\nFor example, you could engage in entrepreneurial projects, at your own expense, that you might transform into a working business.\n\nEven if you cannot find a paid job, you can work part time as a volunteer in the meanwhile.  Not only does volunteering help people out, but it can give you valuable experience while exercizing your work skills and people skills, and also connects you with more people, which also gives you a better chance at finding gainful employment in your field. Being a volunteer not only boosts your life skills, but likewise, boosts the appeal of your resume.\n\nThe more you involve yourself with work interacting with a wide variety of people, the more work opportunities you'll find.

Basically anything else depends on what kind of home office you're looking for. As in, what you'll be using it for. Like basic billing and that sort of ""home esk"" thing. Or if work will be done in it for a specific business. It's really all up to you. Get the basics you need and then as  you go along it'll grow as you need more things. Just make sure and keep your desk clean, makes it much easier to find your specific paperwork. Ohhh and always file!!"
(m)\n\nThe B Vitamins\nThere's more than one B vitamin. Here's the list: B1, B2, B6, B12, niacin, folic acid, biotin, and pantothenic acid. Whew - that's quite a group! \n\nThe B vitamins are important in metabolic (say: meh-tuh-bah-lik) activity - this means that they help make energy and set it free when your body needs it. So the next time you're running to third base, thank those B vitamins. This group of vitamins is also involved in making red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. Every part of your body needs oxygen to work properly, so these B vitamins have a big job. \n\nWhich foods are rich in vitamin B?\n\nwhole grains, such as wheat and oats \nfish and seafood \npoultry and meats \neggs \ndairy products, like milk and yogurt \nleafy green vegetables \nbeans and peas \ncitrus fruits, such as oranges
Are there any companies in your area who have laid employees off? That's a great start because they probably have lots of excess computers. If they donate some to your daycare they get to write that off as a tax deduction. (Don't be shy about asking for the number you need, not just one.)\n\nLarge corporations often upgrade their computers every few years. You might ask any company if they have old computers they would be willing to donate, even if they haven't laid people off.\n\nIf you go to a church, you might ask them to put something in their newsletter. Someone in the congregation might have an old one, oor might just donate a new one, or maybe one of the groups in the church would go in together and donate one.\n\nIf you do get one, have the kids write a really nice thank you or draw pictures to send to them. \n\nGood luck.

"""George Mason (December 11, 1725 – October 7, 1792) was a United States patriot, statesman, and delegate from Virginia to the U.S. Constitutional Convention. He has been called the ""Father of the Bill of Rights"".\n\nMason wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which detailed specific rights of citizens. He was later a leader of those who pressed for the addition of explicitly stated individual rights as part of the U.S. Constitution. His efforts eventually succeeded in convincing the Federalists (such as James Madison) to modify the Constitution and add the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments of the Constitution). The Bill of Rights is based on Mason's earlier Virginia Declaration of Rights. The French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was also based on George Mason's work.\n\nAlthough a slave owner himself, Mason favored the abolition of slave trade, and withheld his name from the U.S. Constitution in part because it failed to do so.""\n\n""He and his wife had twelve children, nine of whom survived to adulthood.""\n\n\nSo either he couldn't stand up because he was dead, or when he was alive, because he was having so much sex."

The odds are very poor whether you are in Australia or US -- unless you have something to provide the bank as collateral. A restaurant is not something that you can do for $1000 only -- you need more; and for a financial institution to give you a loan, you need to show that you are capable of repaying the loan, that you have a strong business, you have experience in the business or a strong management team will help you, you have collateral and you have the right character. Banks simply want to make sure that they can get their money bank. Right now, with your conditions, you are too-high risk to be provided with a loan.

"As Jehovah's Witnesses, we maintain a strict standing on any kind of involvement in false religious practices, traditions, or ceremonies. With such a wedding taking place in one of the false religious churches of Christendom, we would not attend in order to not offend God or allow anyone there to become under the impression that we share in the false religious part of that particular ceremony.\n\n""Been there"" doesn't have the slightest idea what they're talking about. Whether a building has windows or not has absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. The fact of the matter is that the ceremony will undoubtedly be performed by the church's pastor or priest, and the church itself is steeped in false religious beliefs and practices. True Christians, like her grandmother, would not have any kind of involvement (including attending) in that."

All you can do is to keep on doing what is right without worrying about what he thinks.

hello arya,\n\nmy answer to part one of your question is this,\nchat rooms by design allow people the format to share their thoughts. sometimes people want to be something they are not. insecure people can force themselves upon others without the fear of retribution, so in effect this gives them the permission they seek to be rude. i have also found that the only way a weak mind can forceably express itself is through profanity. so i will let you draw your own conclusions to that statement.\n\nas far as part two,\narya there are a lot of lonely people in this world and while personally i am not into the whole cyber sex thing, i can understand how it happens. you sound like a reasonable person as your question is stated lucidly, but remember there are a lot of simple minded people in this world that do what they can to get by.\n\nyour question is well stated and i hope my thoughts are helpful to you.\n\ntony

"Because big cats have PRIDE. (Gnuck, gnuck.)\n\nAnd it would really hurt if you were a little house cat and had to give birth to a lion. Ouch!\n\nIt's just a matter of language. English has all kinds of unusual terms for groups of animals, & there's not any logic to it. One way you could think of it is that the name for the group isn't organized around taxonomy (the scientific categorization of species). We'd say a ""flock of seagulls"" or a ""flock of sheep,"" but a group of crows is, believe it or not, a ""murder of crows.""\n\nThe same kind of thing with what we call young animals. Goats have kids & people have kids. Your example is just one that works the opposite way, when like things are differentiated rather than clumped together."

"August is the eighth month of the year in the Gregorian Calendar and one of seven Gregorian months with the length of 31 days.\n\nAugust begins (astrologically) with the sun in the sign of Leo and ends in the sign of Virgo. Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of Cancer and ends in the constellation of Leo.\n\nIn 1945 the end of the Second World War was brought about following the August 6 bombing of Hiroshima and August 9 bombing of Nagasaki in the first and only use of nuclear weapons against civilian targets. Emperor Hirohito declared Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14.\n\nAugust was named in honor of Augustus. The month reputedly has 31 days because Augustus wanted as many days as Julius Caesar's July. Augustus placed the month where it is because that is when Cleopatra died. Before Augustus renamed August, it was called Sextilis in Latin, since it was the sixth month in the Roman calendar which started in March.\n\nIn the pagan wheel of the year August begins at or near Lughnasadh in the northern hemisphere and Imbolc in the southern hemisphere.\n\nIn Ireland, (in the Irish language) August is known as Lúnasa, a modern rendition of Lughnasadh, named after the god Lugh and August 1, (Lá Lúnasa) in the Irish Calendar is still regarded as the first day of Autumn. The first Monday in August is one of the public holidays in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSome of Ireland's most famous battles have being fought in this month. They include - theSecond Battle of Athenry (1316); the battle of Knockdoe (1504); the Battle of the Yellow Ford (1596); the First Battle of Curlew Pass (1599); the Battle of Dungans Hill (1647); the Battle of Castlebar (1798), and the Battle of the Bogside (1969).\n\nIn the old Japanese calendar, the month is called hatsuki (葉月).\n\nIn Finnish, the month is called elokuu, meaning ""month of reaping"".\n\nIn the UK, August is generally when all academic exam results are published, especially for GCSEs and A-Levels as well as other exams. Also, scholars and school workers such as teachers, have a holiday or non-contact time, and there are two bank holidays (UK). It is typically when people go on holiday due to the availability of time.\n\nDuring August 13 to 19, Philippines schools and theaters celebrate the National Week of the Filipino Language.\n\nIn Spain, August is the holiday month for most workers.\n\nIn Brazil, folk superstition associates bad luck to August, with the proverb ""Agosto, o mês do desgosto"" (""August, the month of misfortune"") being often heard. This may come from the sinister memories of the St. Bartholomew's day (August 24), which is particularly dreaded in the Northeast of the country. August 24 is also, in the tradition of Candomblé, the day of Eshu, one of the most malevolent deities. Coincidentally, some unfortunate polical events took place in August, like the suicide of the then President Getúlio Vargas. [1]\n\nEvery last Sunday of August, the Philippines celebrates National Heroes Day in commemoration of the First Cry of the Philippine Revolution on August 23, 1896.\n\nAugust is also the name of a Japanese visual novel company."

"How can you love someone who said that to you?  He doesn't even want to be your friend.  What kind of relationship would that be?  It certainly wouldn't be very good for you.  He would use you for your love.\n\nYour feelings are hard to get over.  I've been there.  Trust me, they will go away in time.  Just keep yourself busy with other friends and activities.\n\nIf you can't avoid seeing him, and I strongly suggest you do until you get over your feelings, just be calm and polite.  Don't initiate conversation other than ""Hi"", and if he asks you questions, answer simply.  As far as he knows, you are doing just fine without him.  That will make him hurt, just a little.  Don't throw yourself at him, because that will just make him run."

Subprime starts at a 500 mid score.\n\nThe par rates that you see in the newspaper are for 80% or less loans with a 620 or better score without excessive debt or bad payment history.\n\nFor higher loan to value (LTV) loans the average is about 680 for the normal going rates.\n\nYour average credit score will have to match the program that you are applying for... but if you have a score about 675 without any mortgage or rental payment lates in the past 12-24 months, don't have excessive monthly payments on credit cards and car payments... you'll approve for just about all mortgage programs...

Success relies more on communication skills than any other area of expertise in almost every field.
Every asst. manager job varies from property to property. It depends, mostly on the size of the property who does what. If it is a large property there is probably a leasing person to show apartments, answer phones, prepare lease files, do the filing and the correspondance. If the property is small that falls on the asst. manager to do.\n\nThe asst. manager covers for the manager, which is why they are called assistant managers. You screen calls, take care of the small problems that come in, handle walk in people,prepare newsletters and bulletins. Discuss decisions with the manager if they ask for input, make decisions when the manager is not available. You do basically whatever the manager asks you to do. Your job is to take the burden off the manager without acting like the manager. Or trying to take over the manager's job by second guessing the manager.\n\nThat's a very general description. Asst. managers are extremely difficult to find, good ones anyway. You are the most valuable person to the manager. Usually when the manager leaves, the asst. moves up to take the manager's position.

"The Hanging Gardens of Babylon \n\nFruits and flowers... Waterfalls... Gardens hanging from the palace terraces... Exotic animals... This is the picture of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon in most people's minds. It may be surprising to know that they might have never existed except in the minds of Greek poets and historians!\nLocation\n\nOn the east bank of the River Euphrates, about 50 km south of Baghdad, Iraq.\nHistory\n\nThe Babylonian kingdom flourished under the rule of the famous King, Hammurabi (1792-1750 BC). It was not until the reign of Naboplashar (625-605 BC) of the Neo-Babylonian dynasty that the Mesopotamian civilization reached its ultimate glory. His son, Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562 BC) is credited for building the legendary Hanging Gardens. It is said that the Gardens were built by Nebuchadnezzar to please his wife or concubine who had been ""brought up in Media and had a passion for mountain surroundings"".\n\nWhile the most descriptive accounts of the Gardens come from Greek historians such as Berossus and Diodorus Siculus, Babylonian records stay silent on the matter. Tablets from the time of Nebuchadnezzar do not have a single reference to the Hanging Gardens, although descriptions of his palace, the city of Babylon, and the walls are found. Even the historians who give detailed descriptions of the Hanging Gardens never saw them. Modern historians argue that when Alexander's soldiers reached the fertile land of Mesopotamia and saw Babylon, they were impressed. When they later returned to their rugged homeland, they had stories to tell about the amazing gardens and palm trees at Mesopotamia.. About the palace of Nebuchadnezzar.. About the Tower of Babel and the ziggurats. And it was the imagination of poets and ancient historians that blended all these elements together to produce one of the World Wonders.\n\nIt wasn't until the twentieth century that some of the mysteries surrounding the Hanging Gardens were revealed. Archaeologists are still struggling to gather enough evidence before reaching the final conclusions about the location of the Gardens, their irrigation system, and their true appearance. Some recent researchers even suggest that the Hanging Gardens were built by Senaherib, not by Nebuchadnezzar II (ca. 100 years earlier).\nDescription\n\nDetailed descriptions of the Gardens come from ancient Greek sources, including the writings of Strabo and Philo of Byzantium. Here are some excerpts from their accounts:\n\n    ""The Garden is quadrangular, and each side is four plethra long. It consists of arched vaults which are located on checkered cube-like foundations.. The ascent of the uppermost terrace-roofs is made by a stairway...""\n\n    ""The Hanging Garden has plants cultivated above ground level, and the roots of the trees are embedded in an upper terrace rather than in the earth. The whole mass is supported on stone columns... Streams of water emerging from elevated sources flow down sloping channels... These waters irrigate the whole garden saturating the roots of plants and keeping the whole area moist. Hence the grass is permanently green and the leaves of trees grow firmly attached to supple branches... This is a work of art of royal luxury and its most striking feature is that the labor of cultivation is suspended above the heads of the spectators"".\n\nMore recent archaeological excavations at the ancient city of Babylon in Iraq uncovered the foundation of the palace. Other findings include the Vaulted Building with thick walls and an irrigation well near the southern palace. A group of archaeologists surveyed the area of the southern palace and reconstructed the Vaulted Building as the Hanging Gardens. However, the Greek historian Strabo had stated that the gardens were situated by the River Euphrates. So others argue that the site is too far from the Euphrates to support the theory since the Vaulted Building is several hundreds of meters away. They r"

it all depends on how much you puke or just don't eat and exercise. One time i ate only breakfast puked everything else up if i ate and i exercised a lot. By doing that i lost 15 pounds in three weeks. I'm sure if i watched what i ate at breakfast time i would have lost more. So it all depends on how much you are willing to put into it.

"someone could have several different views with this. what exactly does he model? does it pay good enough that it would be motivation to continue or is it for kicks? does it affect your sex life?, some times, unfortunatley it makes sex so much better....other times, you feel you are competeing or being sized up.

"You are on your way just by acknowledging that you are thinking negatively. Everytime you have a negative thought, catch yourself and turn it into a positive.

It is an older book but very good. I am sure it is in the library. Read some uplifting books. You will pick up on the positive lanquage and thoughts.  Good luck..you will be more upbeat in no time!"

That's the best time to do it!  (In fact, I'm told that persecuted Christians in other countries are actually praying that Americans will begin to face persecution.  They are praying this out of love because they know that in hard times, this is when we lean on God the most).\nWhen we feel secure in our own ability to handle life, the human instinct is to leave God on a shelf in our own minds.  However, when hard times come, we realize that we are fragile humans in need of a loving, all-powerful God - our Father.  He is always quick to draw near us, just as we would while teaching a young child to walk when it appears that they are about to fall.\nMy advice: find a quiet place & a good praise CD.  Pop it in, and enter into His presence with thanksgiving in your heart.  Enter His courts with praise.  Once you have entered into a spirit of worship, begin to read the Bible, or you could simply sit quietly, and wait to hear from God.  (Prayer isn't always an act of speaking - the best prayers are often the act of listening).\nLean on His guidance, and He will direct your paths.  You are NOT alone!  God bless.
There is the will, if no will half goes to the spouse along with any retirement plans, then agencies and other people can fight over debts.  Then anything after that goes to the spouse.  If there is no spouse, then it's next of kin.  If no next of kin then the government keeps the money after the debts are paid.
Nice question. I just answered the Girl Scout cookie question, so my mind naturally was on my elementary school years...and what flashed by immediately was being in a warm, cozy house with a fire burning in the fireplace, my Mom cooking dinner, the table set with glowing candles, fresh chrysanthemums arranged in the entry hall, and curled up snugly under my Grandmother's hand-sewn quilt, reading one of my favorite childhood books, like The Bobbsey Twins, or Nancy Drew. The memory is a trigger of joy to me, and I thank you for such a special question.
Nice thought, but no go.  You are not extending credit to the tenants.  Nor do you want to go through the disclosure process necessary for reporting each account.\n\nThis is really a can of worms, and like they say no good deed goes unpunished.  If you were not properly disclosed, the penalties could be rather severe... see link for the FTC/Fair Credit reporting.\n\nEven if you were reporting good activity, your reporting would affect other creditors determination of whether to extend/reject an applicant for credit.\n\nYou'd be able to report judgements, but this would appear in the public records section of a credit report anyway. Also, you'd be able to report collections if you were set up as a collection agency.\n\nGood idea, just not worth it.

Even though you feel singled out, rest assured that everyone is subjected to the values/morals of other people at various times in their lives.  Life isn't always fair.   And this unfairness learned through childhood will prepare you for the unfairness you will experience as an adult.  I'm not saying it's right.  I'm just trying to assure you that 'kids' aren't alone experiencing injustices.
It really depends on where you are in what city and state. Where I live they are located at the County Health Dept.
Spending money is what drives our economy forward.\n\nWhen people spend, it drives aggregate demand up - this basically is the sum of all things we want as a country. As aggregate demand rises, production will rise to meet this demand (assuming there are idle resources). This means jobs will be created, factories and businesses will open, and the good times will roll.

Industrial wastes cause pollution in four major areas: air, water, soil and atmosphere. Those wastes that are gaseous pollute air that living things breath or use for food production as in plants. Gaseous wastes in air will either kill living things or disturb their normal processes. Gaseous pollutants also pollute our atmosphere that the atmosphere will lose its ability of blanketing the earth from hostile rays coming from the sun and space. Acid rain is as well caused by gaseous wastes. Wastes also pollute water bodies and soil and result in killing or disturbing the normal processes of living things specially plants.

Unfortionatly in every job there will be someone you can not stand. Whether it be your boss or co-workers. I would say that when it is time to leave is when you start getting so stressed out about having to go to work in the morning, that you make yourself sick physically (Like panic attacks) and you think about how you dont want to go to work the next morning when you arte trying to get to sleep. Or when you start to feel your self-worth is nothing, that would be extremes though. They have to be constant feelings though because we all have those days where life just sucks. lol. If you love your job and what you do than. keep it. Dont let one prick get in the way of something you love.

"You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list from Lesko that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

Media usage used to be tracked through market research and consumer surveys/census using a special set top box attached to the TV. This device tracks what channels a typical household watches.  The survey contains the ages of the viewers and the time each of them watches TV.  And this device is kept for months in surveyed households.  Nowadays, with cable TV, monitoring is much more difficult.  Not only that, even music is no longer exclusively heard through radio, you have CDs, mp3s and a whole lot more variety of media choices.  How do you track media usage with all this information?  Internet surveys is one way.  But these are difficult to validate without the devices that attest that one watches specific shows at specific times.  Can you safely presume that everyone answers the survey correctly and honestly?  This is one great challenge of market research today.

"Hello:\n\nI would start as soon as I had all of my licensing, furniture and lesson plans in order.  My girlfriend started a daycare in NJ in July of 1998 and there was such a high demand that within a year she had opened another location and was renting the basement of a church to house the after school children. (Amost all of her staff was from the local community college early childhood education program.they needed the experience so she got quality help for minimum wage.)  She had a waiting list before she opened her doors (it started in the front room on the 1st floor or her house).  She called existing daycares and the local Urban League and Social Services Day Care Unit and they gave her name and number to people on their waiting lists.\n\nShe also has a very HUGE waiting list for her summer program.  She barely goes out with the summer program kids herself anymore but her staff loves it.  They get to ""hang out"" and get paid all summer and the kids aren't stuck in front of a baby sitters TV all summer while their parents are working.  My kids went for 3 summers while I lived in NJ. Most of her ""trips"" for the kids were to free venues (The park, the pool, nature walks, visiting a gallery, the lake) they loved it.  And if you grow beyond your initial 10 kids you would be able to help your community by providing jobs as well as quality daycare.\n\nBest of luck"

The remaining book value can be from intangible assets like goodwill, trademarks, copyrights, organization costs, non-compete agreements & others. Many of which could be worth considerably less than the carring value on the books. Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging usually from 5 to 15 years.\n\nHope this helps.

It depends on the structure. Some structures will eventually collapse. This is the so called pyramid scams. If you can look at a marketing plan and see that the company is making money then you should be OK. I have seen some plans where eventually the company loses. If the company loses then you will eventually lose.

:) You're awesome!!  You know what I do if I want to make changes, I write down everything i am unhappy with. I write down what it is I want to change, how I am going to change it, I give myself a target date(goal setting) :D Remember that you don't want to do it all at once because that is when you get discouraged. Set your target dates in a reasonable time frame and make sure they are far enough from each other. Changes don't happen over night you have to work at it and make them happen. A little at a time and don't get discouraged. You will run into challenges, but don't see them as stumbling blocks, see them as stepping stones, we learn from everything. \n\nHope it helps :) I hope this is what you are looking for. \n\nGood luck two thumbs and four paws up to you!

"I saw a Chinese albino in Hong Kong not long ago, and she seemed exceedingly self-conscious. I noticed others were staring at her quite rudely, although the social behavior in Hong Kong is far more sophisticated than in mainland China. (so I can only imagine how rough it would be to be an albino in China)\n\nAnd, there was an albino who posted a question on this forum about 2 months ago. She was having trouble getting a driver's license in Malayasia - just because she was an albino.\n\nHere is a link that has ""frequently asked questions"" about being an albino:"
Yah, sure, it's for real. Also the Abominable Snowman, the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, stories about French intelligence or bravery, and that thing about St Patrick driving all the snakes from Ireland are all true as well.\n\nAnd there really is a monster living in your closet.
You're right, Sweetie.  Actually, he has 3 ID's.\nHe is also 'alabamamissy' if you go in and check his answered questions you will see all of the questions asked by her & he did the same thing....asked a question, answered as BrianL and then chose himself as the best answer.\nUnfortunately, some people don't have a life so...\nthey do the best they can at making themselves one.\nThis probably makes him feel very important to ... himself.\nHe is a very sad human being.\n\nBrianL is Alabamaser and Alabamamissy - he unfortunately uses MS as his play point which is very sad and ignorant.\nHe probably has more...but I'm not wasting any more moments of my life on him.  He's already threatened to harrass me on all my questions and answers.  So probably expect one on here from him.\n\nDon't worry about it, Sweetie.  The only thing that bothers me with him doing it is that he has his questions and answers lined up...then when someone else answers to the best of their ability....he calls thems names or tells them how ignorant they are....which just makes him the ignorant one. \n\nIt's not like he's going to win A Million bucks or anything.  Think of it this way....he's just wasting three times as much of his life than we are on this silly site.  Lol.\n\nBesides...I just went into his open questions and busted him...just for you! \n\n\nLighten up, Sweetie.\nYou must be very young to let such small things bother you.\n\nHave a great weekend...go out and enjoy life and get off of this silly computer!!\n\nBy the way... you make a GREAT detective.  Might be an occupation you want to pursue.

I suggest you post a resume on Monster.com.  Just state that you are looking to get out of the midwest DIRECTLY ON THE RESUME! Also, create a .pdf form of your resume and check out jobs in various states through state employment agencies online. Just e-mail your resume to them and tell them the same.

There can be some tremors that precede a quake.  This is called a foreshock sequence.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine a foreshock sequence until after the quake occurs.  There may also be surface disruption with land features being slightly twisted or misaligned.  In some rare instances, natural springs have stopped or started before a quake happened although this usually happens as a result of a quake.\n\nIn general, there is very little that we are aware of yet in terms of warning signs of a pending quake.

Take the cotton wool out of your ears and put it in your mouth,watch,listen,learn..

Hurricane, name applied to migratory tropical cyclones that originate over oceans in certain regions near the equator, and particularly to those arising in the West Indian region, including the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane-type cyclones in the western Pacific are known as typhoons.\n\nMost hurricanes originate within the doldrums, a narrow equatorial belt characterized by intermittent calms, light variable breezes, and frequent squalls, and lying between the northeast and southeast trade winds. As the doldrums of the Atlantic are situated largely to the north of the equator, hurricanes do not occur in the South Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific doldrums extend north and south of the equator; thus hurricanes occur in the South and North Pacific oceans.\n\nHurricanes consist of high-velocity winds blowing circularly around a low-pressure center, known as the eye of the storm. The low-pressure center develops when the warm, saturated air prevalent in the doldrums is underrun and forced upward by denser, cooler air. From the edge of the storm toward its center, the atmospheric pressure drops sharply and the wind velocity rises. The winds attain maximum force close to the point of lowest pressure (about 724 torr, or about 28.5 in. of mercury). The diameter of the area affected by winds of destructive force may exceed 240 km (150 mi). Gale winds prevail over a larger area, averaging 480 km (300 mi) in diameter. The strength of a hurricane is rated from 1 to 5. The mildest, Category 1, has winds of at least 120 km/h (74 mph). The strongest (and rarest), Category 5, has winds that exceed 250 km/h (155 mph). Within the eye of the storm, which averages 24 km (15 mi) in diameter, the winds stop and the clouds lift, but the seas remain very violent.\n\nHurricanes generally move in a path resembling the curve of a parabola. In the northern hemisphere the storms usually travel first in a northwesterly direction and in the higher latitudes turn toward the northeast. In the southern hemisphere the usual path of the hurricane is initially to the southwest and subsequently to the southeast. Hurricanes travel at varying rates. In the lower latitudes the rate ranges from 8 to 32 km/h (5 to 20 mph) and in the higher latitudes it may increase to as much as 80 km/h (50 mph). Those areas in which the hurricane winds blow in the same direction as the general movement of the storm are subjected to the maximum destructive violence of the hurricane.\n\nSince 1943 U.S. military aircraft have been flying into hurricanes to measure wind velocities and directions, the location and size of the eye, the pressures within the storms, and their thermal structure. A coordinated system of tracking hurricanes was developed in the mid-1950s, and periodic improvements have been made over the years. Radar, sea-based recording devices, geosynchronous weather satellites (since 1966), and other devices now supply data to the National Hurricane Center in Florida, which follows each storm virtually from the beginning. Improved systems of prediction and communication have been able to help minimize loss of life in hurricanes, but property damage is still heavy, especially in coastal regions. The strongest hurricane to hit the western hemisphere in the 20th century, Gilbert, devastated Jamaica and parts of Mexico in 1988 with winds that gusted up to 350 km/h (218 mph). Destructive hurricanes in recent U.S. history include Hugo (1989), with $4.2 billion in damage and more than 50 deaths, and Andrew (1992), with $15.5 billion in damage, more than 50 dead, and thousands left homeless

Think about what you really want to do and have your resume at the top indicate what you want to do. Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.

"Yes. Eatoni Ergonomics files a suit against Blackberry and T-Mobile. Read the article below:\n\n""Startup Eatoni Ergonomics Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit against BlackBerry-maker Research In Motion Ltd., alleging the company's 7100 Series devices infringe on its patents for predictive text entry. Along with the suit, Eatoni's chief executive officer offered some choice words on the issue. \n\n""The problem is that the RIM 7100 is good, good enough to infringe the patent, but not good enough to create a new standard for mobile text entry,'' said Howard Gutowitz, Eatoni's CEO. ""That's why we have to stop it now and hopefully convince RIM and others to introduce new devices which implement the technology properly.'' \n\nGutowitz added: ""Of course, they've got fabulously more money than we do, but the truth is the truth, and we count on the judge and jury to see that.'' \n\nRIM said it is not infringing on Eatoni's patents and believes it will prevail in the case. A trial date is set for late next year. \n\nInterestingly, T-Mobile USA Inc. also was named as a defendant in the lawsuit. However, T-Mobile is only one of several carriers that sell the 7100 device; Cingular Wireless L.L.C. and Dobson Communications Corp. also sell the device. An Eatoni official said it was a fair move to name only T-Mobile USA. \n\nEatoni alleges the design of RIM's 7100 QWERTY keyboard infringes on its patents for predictive text entry. \n\nThis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the BlackBerry maker. The most notable such suit is NTP Inc.'s patent-infringement case, which could potentially find its way to the Supreme Court. RIM is currently appealing a 2002 jury ruling in favor of NTP. NTP alleges RIM's BlackBerry offering infringes on its patents for wireless e-mail. \n\nThe NTP vs. RIM case has raised a notable amount of interest, both in the wireless industry as well as the legal profession. The outcome of the case could have serious implications for wireless e-mail vendors as well as patent law in general."""

Have you ever seen the movie oh darn whats the movie- anyways it has robin williams and he was first a robot and he decided that he wanted to become human to know what it was like to live, love, laugh, and enjoy life...well at one point he starts to cry and he realizes he feels- we feel so that we can have a deeper connection not only with ourselves but with the world around us. Feeling is a much needed thing - think about this if you had no feelings - you have a dog and it gets hit by a car a person with no feelings would shrug it off and walk away - a person with feelings who had a bond a connection would be very grieved on the matter - thats something to think on.
There is a risk / reward equation to every situation. A person must decide if the reward is worth the risk. In MLM the picture given at the outset is EXTREMELY rosey and there are those who buy in. A person isn't trying to lose friends at the outset. Let me tell you hope fades fast, which isn't a reason not to hope again.

Well, I've lived in Senegal for a few years and the Senegalese people are very kind and hospitable. They use drums, mainly, in their music. Sometimes, they use an instrument like a banjo(kind of). They play them really fast and they dance to it with a lot of snappy movements. Wolof is their traditional language. I only know a few words. They passed their music down from generation to generation. These instruments and type of dance are how they were long before.
This is a copy and paste from the website listed below.\n\nThough Hermes had many tasks and responsibilities as a God, his main function was as the messenger to the Gods. Besides carrying messages, many of the Gods relied on him to help hide their own misdeeds. He was wore winged sandals for speed, and carried a caduceus (known today as a symbol of medicine). He was also involved in travel, good luck and fortune, gambling, creativity, astronomy, music, public speaking, medicine, literature and athletics.\n\nHermes also functioned as a psychopomp, leading the souls of the dead to Hades. Because as an infant, he snuck away from his mother and stole cattle from Apollo, Hermes is the patron God of thieves.\n\nHermes father was Zeus, but his mother was Maia (a Nymph). Most of Hermes' children are lesser known figures of Greek history, but he did father Pan, the wild nature. Pan's mother was either Penelope (wife of Odysseus) or Callisto (another Nymph). As with much of the lineages of Greek legend, it depends on which myths you are reading.\n\nHermes was in control of the elements, and was the patron God of alchemists. Even today, he is credited with founding the magickal practices of Hermeticism. Not a religion, this is an esoteric path that includes alchemy, Qabalah, and theosophy. He is sometimes associated with the Egyptian god of knowledge and writing, Thoth. It's believed that Hermes/Thoth created the Emerald Tablets, which form the basis of Hermetic thought.\n\nIn the Roman pantheon, Hermes was known as Mercury.

It depends on how nice you would like your wedding.  $20,000 will give you a very nice wedding for 330 guests.  As a wedding planner I would say that is a good budget that should cover everything.  Of course it all depends on where you are having the wedding.
Height doesn't matter actually. If both of you love each other than that won't be a problem. Unless you feel the uneasiness of the height barrier than you have no choice but to break. If both doesn't even have the barrier because of height diff than it should be alright.

As a Leo, your ruling planet is the Sun. In fact the Sun is not a planet, but truly the centre of our Solar system. As above, so below! You too are a centre of dynamic energy and exhibit the qualities of the Sun in full measure. You are warm, bright and self-aware. Therefore, you want to make an impression in everything you do—in work, in love and in your social life as well.\n\nYou are known for being a show-off, but this is a misconception. Your dramatic flair is part and parcel of your in-built zest for life, love of people and optimistic attitude. Life to you is like a stage on which to perform and express your talents in full measure. In your upbeat state of mind, others are carried away by your positive mental attitude and this is what endears them to you. You enjoy sharing your joys and successes with those you love and when you do, you do so magnanimously without thought of return. \n\nYour loyalty is also another of your trademarks and you give as good, if not better, than you take. In friendship you give your all and expect the same in return. People know you as a genuine friend who is always ready to give a hand. It seems that even if you can’t help someone with their specific problem, you somehow still manage to exude a warm and reassuring vibration that makes them feel better for being with you. \n\nThe downside of Leo is a misplaced pride, a need to “one-up” others and this, in the less evolved Leo, is a warning that whatever pinnacle is reached in life may result in a fall. Humility ought to be cultivated at every step of your path. You will be recognised for your vibrant energy and self-motivated action. You don’t need to big-note yourself to others. People will instantly recognise your abilities and even look up to you. If this adulation begins to go to your head, you must listen to the cautionary advice of a good friend when s/he says, “Step down a notch or two, Leo!” \n\nYou are a born leader and others naturally look up to you for guidance and security. At times you are hard on others and demand the excellence from them that you exhibit in your own actions. People gravitate towards you and you will no doubt be capable of reaching the zenith of whatever path you choose in your life. \n\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Leo, study your totem, the Lion. The way in which Leo the Lion rules the jungle, yet at the same time nurtures the young cubs is a perfect description of your Leo strength and domination, blended with tenderness and devotion.

The more info you have the better.  If you use a mortgage broker they are going to search their base of investors, whether they are using big money like Washington mutual or some other lending sources or private money.  You don't want to have every mortgage broker run your credit because the more hits you get asking for your rating the more your rating can be affected. The best thing to do is check your rating yourself and then present your info to the broker and ask him to give you a good faith estimate.  There are many things to watch for when doing these transactions so do your homework and take no shortcuts.  The lender, whether it be the bank or investors, is going to look at 1.  Your income, through check stubs with year to date info\n2.  Your credit rating, 680 or higher is pretty good\n3.  Your current profession and how long you've been in it, or on the current job.\nAnd maybe some other things also.  I just got done with a loan package so somethings are still fresh in my memory.  Make sure you get the info from a broker or a banker and then study the papers ask questions and don't go to every mortgage broker in town having them run your credit. There is a website for someone I know you might email him and get some answers,Good Luck!!!!!

It depends on the test used, but many chemicals will show up as methamphetamine. Ephedra (weight loss drug that is now illegal but it's in some plants and i'm sure people can still get it), pseudoephedrine(in sudafed and many cough medicines), any kind of amphetamine (such as in a prescription weight loss or ADHD drug like desoxyn, dexadrine, adderall). I've heard of kidney disease and diabetes causing false positives. Also you don't have to be using crystal meth do be using methamphetamine, there are also powdered forms, and pills, and a lot of low grade mexican cocaine contains small amounts of methamphetamine that boost the cocaine high without the user knowing it's there. You can tell by tasting the coke, if it takes a second or two before it gets the bitter coke taste and during that time there's a bland taste you just can't figure out, it's mostly likely cut with it.

"There appears to be a lot of tribes...and it would help if the exact time in the 1600's were given. Apparently the earliest records of the area claim that Ontario was mainly occupied by the Algonquian and Iroquoian nations (indian tribes). However the first European to get there was Jacques Cartier and he made his way up the St. Lawrence river and met what he called the ""St. Lawrence Iroquoians"" at Quebec City in 1535. Now obviously I realize that you asked for explorers in the 1600's so the next person would then be Samuel de Champlain who visited the same area in 1603, however the tribes that Jacques saw were gone. According to my research, that area during the late 1500's and throughout most of the 1600's had gone through several different (tribal) wars as well as ""European vs. tribe"" wars. The St. Lawrence river then became what is referred to as ""no man's land"" until the Iroquois came out victorious in battle. Another European finally visted the same stretch of land that the two previous explorers visited and there, met up with the Iroquois nation. However this was in 1673 and the time might be a little to late for your question. \n\nRegardless my best guess would be the Iroquois nation; seeing as how the ""St. Lawrence Iroquoians"" were halfly influenced by the Iroquois nation (the other half being the Huron nation) plus the phrase sounds more like a nickname than anything else. Hope I helped. \nQuestions about the issue: CanDo417@e-garfield.com"

Winston Churchill, Political Leader / Writer / World War II Figure \n\nBorn: 30 November 1874 \nBirthplace: Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England \nDied: 24 January 1965 \nBest Known As: Indefatigable prime minister of Britain during World War II \nSoldier, politician and finally prime minister, Winston Churchill was one of Britain's greatest 20th-century heroes. Churchill fought with the British Army in India and Sudan, and as a journalist was captured in South Africa (where his dispatches from the Boer War first brought him to public prominence). He became a member of Parliament in 1900 and remained an MP for over 64 years. His early topsy-turvy political career earned him many enemies, but his stirring speeches, bulldog tenacity and his refusal to make peace with Adolf Hitler made him the popular choice to lead England through World War II. When Britain and its allies prevailed in 1945, Churchill's place in history was assured. (Ironically, he lost the prime ministership two months after Germany's surrender, when the opposition Labor Party took majority control of Parliament.) One of the 20th century's most quotable wits, Churchill wrote a plethora of histories, biographies and memoirs, including the landmark four-volume A History of the English-speaking Peoples (1956-58). In 1953 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature; he was knighted the same year.\n\nChurchill served as prime minister from 1940-45 and again from 1951-55... His wartime contemporaries included presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, French resistance leader Charles de Gaulle and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin... More recent British PMs have included Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair... The famous portrait of a scowling Churchill was taken by Canadian photographer Yousuf Karsh.\n\nBritish politician and writer. As prime minister (1940–1945 and 1951–1955) he led Great Britain through World War II. Churchill published several works, including The Second World War (1948–1953), and won the 1953 Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nEarly Career\n\nEducated at Harrow and Sandhurst, he became (1894) an officer in the 4th hussars. On leave in 1895, he saw his first military action in Cuba as a reporter for London's Daily Graphic. He served in India and in 1898 fought at Omdurman in Sudan under Kitchener. Having resigned his commission, he was sent (1899) to cover the South African War by the Morning Post, and his accounts of his capture and imprisonment by the Boers and his escape raised him to the forefront of English journalists.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nEarly Government Posts\n\nChurchill was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in 1900, but he subsequently switched to the Liberal party and was appointed undersecretary for the colonies in the cabinet of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. Under Asquith, he was initially (1908–10) president of the Board of Trade, then home secretary (1910–11), and championed innovative labor exchange and old-age pension acts. As first lord of the admiralty (1911), he presided over the naval expansion that preceded World War I.\n\nDiscredited by the failure of the Dardanelles expedition, which he had championed, Churchill lost (1915) his admiralty post and served on the front lines in France. Returning to office under Lloyd George, he served as minister of munitions (1917) and secretary of state for war and for air (1918–21). As colonial secretary (1921–22), he helped negotiate the treaty that set up the Irish Free State.\n\nAfter two defeats at the polls he returned to the House of Commons, as a Constitutionalist, and became (1924–29) chancellor of the exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government. As an advocate of laissez-faire economics, he was strongly criticized by John Maynard Keynes. Churchill was not a financial innovator; he basically followed conventional advice from his colleagues. Nevertheless, Churchill's decision to return the country to the prewar gold standard in

Communism and socialism were the most imp. threat for US at that time. Soviet Union and China had emerged as powerful communist nations added with numerous other states. Peoples movement were going on and communists were strong in many coutries in Asia and Latin America. A large area of the world were under the ideological influence of communism and communism became popular among people from exploited and underdeveloped society. These were against the capitalistic and imperialist interest of many coutries. US was one of them.

If you're after designer fashion (especially shoes), stylish furniture; and like tall, dark, handsome male shop assistants then no where beats Milan. It is better than Rome for shopping although Rome is more historic and picturesque, but if you wanted beauty you you choos Florence over Rome. I know as I've seen all 3.\n\nI live in London but despite loving it would say it's too expensive for Americans due to the sterling:dollar exchange rate. Been to Paris 5 times - great to buy food but it's just overpriced for fashion as the French spend the highest proportion of their income on clothes in the world!\n\nDon't believe Copenhagen! Whilst Denmark is the most exciting of the scandanavian countries it is very socialist so has high taxes on goods; especially food and alcohol to discourage obesity and alcohol related health problems.\n \nMadrid, Spain is ok but they don't offer the best quality (like milan) or the best prices. \n\nIf you want cheap but cheerful you could try the new EU ascension countries like Czech Republic (Love Prague, those Czech women could look gorgeous in potato sacks) and Poland are great.\n\nHappy shopping and bon voyage!

Target Corporation is the fourth largest retailer in the United States, operating 1,556 stores in 47 states. Formerly Dayton Hudson Corporation, Target has three main retail divisions: Target Stores, Mervyn's, and Marshall Field's. Target Stores is the number two discount retailer in the country, trailing only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and has distinguished itself from its competitors by offering upscale, fashion-conscious products at affordable prices. The 1,225 Target stores, which are located in 47 states, generated 84 percent of Target's fiscal 2002 revenues. Included in this store count are Target Greatland units, which are much larger than the typical Target store, averaging 145,000 square feet versus 126,000 square feet; as well as SuperTarget outlets, which are combined discount/grocery stores, averaging 175,000 square feet. Generating 9 percent of 2002 revenues were Mervyn's 267 stores situated in 14 states, primarily in the West, Southwest, and Midwest (specifically Minnesota and Michigan). Based in the San Francisco Bay area, Mervyn's positions itself as a chain of moderately priced, family friendly, neighborhood department stores. Target Corporation's full-service department store division, contributor of 6 percent of sales, is now consolidated under the Marshall Field's banner. The 62 Marshall Field's stores (which include locations that formerly operated under the Dayton's and J.L. Hudson's names) are located in eight states in the upper Midwest, with the majority found within three metropolitan areas: Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit. Target Corporation's philanthropy has been and still is legendary. In 1989 the corporation received the America's Corporate Conscience Award for its magnanimity, and Target contributes more than $2 million each week to the communities in which its stores are located.\n\nEarly Years\n----------------------------\nTarget Corporation bears the strong imprint of its founder, George Draper Dayton. Dayton's father, a physician in New York state, could not afford to send him to college, in part because the doctor freely gave his services to the poor. Hence Dayton set off on his own in 1873 at age 16 to work in a coal and lumberyard. A workaholic, he undermined his health and a year later had to return to the family home to recuperate. Undeterred, he went on to become a banker. Less than ten years later, in 1883, he was rich enough to buy the Bank of Worthington in Minnesota. Meanwhile he had married and had become active in the Presbyterian Church.\n\nDayton's connection with the Presbyterian Church proved to be instrumental to the rise of his Dayton Company. In 1893, the year of a recession that sent local real estate prices tumbling, the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Minneapolis burned down. The insurance did not cover the cost of a new building, and the only other source of income, a corner lot next to the demolished church, was unsalable because the real estate market was doing poorly. The congregation prevailed on the Dayton family, who were faithful members of the church, to purchase it so the building of a new church could proceed. Dayton bought it and eventually erected a six-story building on the lot. Casting about for tenants, he decided to buy the nearby Goodfellow Dry Goods store and set it up in the new building. In the spring of 1902 the store was known as the Goodfellow Dry Goods store; in 1903 the corporate name was changed to Dayton Dry Goods Company, then seven years later simply Dayton Company, the forerunner of Dayton Hudson Corporation and, ultimately, Target Corporation.\n\nEventually the store would expand to fill the six-story edifice. Dayton, with no previous experience in the retail trade, wielded tight control of the company until his death in 1938. His principles of thrift and sobriety and his connections as a banker enabled the company to grow. As long as he was at the helm, the store was run as a fami

His dog died and he went off the deep end and shot the owner with tranquilizers.  The tranquilizer dart got stuck in his jugular and when the store owner tried to remove it before the sedatives kicked in, that was really what did him in.  The blood squirted everywhere and the dogs licked it up.  There was enough tranquilizer in the blood to sedate them.\n\nIt's pretty cheesy and disgusting, but maybe that brainstorm will help give you some ideas.

I'm not exactly sure what you're meaning, but here's two answers.\n\nWith all banks giving credit to YOU, that depends on your FICO score.  Your FICO score determines how reliable you are as a lender. Most banks follow the same rates, depending on your FICO score, and all of them charge you similar amounts. \nWith banks loaning to each other, this is called a federal funds rate.  Banks actually prefer this over the Federal Discount Rate, which is when the Fed loans money to banks.\nThe Fed requires that banks keep a certain amount of money at all times.  This is called a Reserve Requirement.  This is checked periodically and is usually a percentage of total checking deposits.  To make this requirement, banks will loan to each other, thus satisfying the Fed and each bank.

Yes, you can request that a Credit Reporting Agency add a supplement to your credit.  This will not help your score, but it does allow those who run your credit see your explanation for the default.  I am not sure of exactly how each company handles these requests, but if you report it to only one agency, then only one agency is responsible for attaching it to your credit.  They do have to attach the supplement but you may incur a small fee, since it is not a part of your actual report.  When in doubt just give them a call.  Look below for the 3 major CRAs and contact info.

Slim Jim,\nYou can get 100% financing and typically have the seller contribute up to 3% of the selling price of the house to your closing costs.  The only requirement would be that you'd have to have $500 of your own money into the transaction.\n\nThe interest rates are very comparable to 80% or less financing; there is a .5% charge 97% & 100% financing (usually an 1/8 or 1/4 more in interest rate).\n\nThe tough part at the high LTV's can be mortgage insurance.\n\nThe ways around this is:\n1. VA programs and paying the funding fee (good deal)\n2. 80/20 loans, usually a savings in payments over MI\n3. Community Mortgage programs -- This is a great secret that most of us lenders have available.  If you take a home buying/home owning course I have programs that I can offer that have reduced MI.

The whole purpose of our creation was to come here and experience life and to learn.  Unfortunatley for many people it takes something tragic to make them realize how precious our time down here is, and how to make the most of it. All of our experiences make who we are and what we become down the road. There is a purpose for everything that we experience. It is what we do with it and how we handle it that matters. The best thing though is to learn how to love.

Yes, and it is doing so at the moment. In July 2005, the Chinese government relaxed trading controls on the Chinese yuan, prior to this US$1= Y8.25, now today US$1=Y8.04 (a net decrease of 2½%). \n\nAs a result of this the main Chinese stock exchange (The Shanghai Composite) has rallied from 1,060 to 1,250 (17.9%) compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which has increased from 10,390 to 11,021 in the same time frame (+6.1%)). So it would appear that the loosing of controls on the yuan has benefited Chinese stocks, but that those gains are tempered by the lack of performance in the US

"Obtaining someone elses credit report without permission is a federal offense.  That said, it used to be as easy as knowing your SSN and birth-date.\n\nNowadays, it is a little more tough.  Online Credit agencies will ask several security questions that are not easy to answer.\n\nFor example, they might say something like:\n ""Which of the following accounts did you close in 1999:""\n   ""a) Sears""\n   ""b) Home Depot""\n   ""c) Chase""\n   ""d) Citibank""\n\nThere are a series of these questions, whatever they know from your SSN, they can ask for, addresses, accounts, etc.\n\nNow, somebody like a spouse in an ongoing divorce can easily know all that information and obtain a credit report.  However, even this inquiry will show up on the credit report.  If you pull it yourself, you could see that someone else got it (not always easy to read).\n\nIn the case I mentioned of a spouse in a divorce  it is hard to tell what the authorities would do.  It would likely not be investigated, and it depends on the state and judge.  If there was an order to respect the others privacy, it would at least be contempt of court.\n\nBut again:\n  - every time your credit-file is pulled, there is a entry made (stays for 3 months)\n  - it is a federal offense, if you think someone got it against your will, call the agency you got your report from and ask for an investigation.\n  - Last but not least, all your creditors are allowed to pull your credit on a regular basis"

"Hitler and his henchmen decided to rid the ""Fatherland"" of Germany and its conquered neighbors of the disabled, disfigured, transient, gypsy and jewish populations.  The concentration camps were a place where people were efficiently shipped to take part in this ethnic cleansing or Xenocide campaign.  The basic idea was to remove them from the public eye, use them for labor where needed, and kill the less useful.    In other words, it was a coldly calculated means of mass murder and enslavement, and is one of the worst examples of human behavior in recorded history."

This is great for you! What is your passion? What is your favorite activity (keep it clean!)?  Think about why you like to do that. Think about the history of that activity, how it began, how you got to liking doing it, whether you think you always will enjoy it.  Then do some research so you have facts about the history and development of it (if, for instance, you like video games).  Then make an outline with an introduction, the history, how you began in it, what doing it means to you now, where you see yourself and the activity in the future and a conclusion.\nIf you are talking about something that really interests you, this will be a very easy presentation for you.\nRehearse it and give it to family and friends first so you can get some constructive criticism before you have to do it in front of the teacher (or whoever is requiring this of you).\n\nGood luck, and as hard as it seems--have some fun with it.

"Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of Islam. They are referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna (Arabic: أهل السنة), the folks of the tradition. The word Sunni comes from the word sunna (Arabic : سنة ) which means the tradition of the prophet of Islam Muhammad.\n\nShi'a Islam or Shi`ism (from the Arabic word شيعة, Persian: شیعه) is the second largest denomination of the religion of Islam. Shi'a Muslims adhere to the teachings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his Ahlul Bayt (family). Thus, Shi'as reject the rule of the initial three Sunni Caliphs as Sunnis reject the Imamate of the Shi'a Imams. The singular/adjective form is shi`i (Arabic: شيعي.) and refers to a supporter of the Ahlul Bayt and of Ali ibn Abi Talib (Imam Ali) in particular.\n\nSome thirty years after Muhammad's death, the Islamic community plunged into the First Islamic civil war. This civil war led to the emergence of three distinct Islamic groups:\n\nSunnis - Sunnis regard the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman, and Ali) as Rightly Guided Caliphs, that is, caliphs who ruled in accordance with the Qur'an and the sunnah, or way of Muhammad and Sunni reject the Shia Imams. Sunnis believe that most of the succeeding caliphs failed to live up to these standards. In spite of these failures on the part of the secular leadership, the Sunni clergy (the ulema) counseled believers to submit to the authorities; this was better than constant community strife. The full name of the Sunni branch is Ahl al-Sunna wa al-Jama'ah. \nShi'a - Shi'a regard Imam Ali as the first Imam and generally reject the first three sunni's caliphates, believing that his was the only ""Rightly Guided"" caliphate, and that only the Imams of the household and descendants of Muhammad have the right to rule. Shi'as and a handful of Sunni scholars accepted Hasan ibn Ali's claim as caliph, though historical consensus states that Hasan Have ruled for six months.The Salafis (or the Early Muslims), do not accept the Shi'a as Muslims. \n\nThis was the third group:\n\nKhwarij, or Kharijites - The Khwarij were initially loyal to Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph, but turned against him after he accepted arbitration during the First Islamic civil war. Because the Khwarij had a very narrow view of what constitutes kufr (acts that invalidate one's Islam), they quickly split up into sects within themselves, each accusing one another of having fallen into disbelief. Though one branch of the Khwarij survives in Yemen and Oman as the Ibadi denomination of Islam, Khwarij doctrine has been largely rejected and relegated to the history books. \nOther divisions have arisen since the civil war of the 7th century CE. Some groups are now extinct. Of the existing groups, Sunni Muslims do not accept members of the Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Zikri as fellow Muslims."
You should go see a doctor.  It could be many things, but there is a chance you have rheumatoid arthritis.  It is characterized by morning stiffnes in the joints, along with pain and inflammation.\n\nI am 23, and one year ago I started off with similar symptoms in one finger, then I started getting it in the others.  I went to the doctor, was diagnosed with RA, and started treatment.\n\nAlthough your problem may not be RA (I hope it's not... it's a serious, debilitating disease but their are some great treatments now), you should see a doctor ASAP.  Make sure you demand a blood test so they can check your inflammation levels etc.  If you do have RA, the sooner you start treatment the better.  It took me about 9 months to regain the use of my hands, and I'm lucky that I did.  It can cause permanent damage, but the newer meds can help slow down the damage.  Go ASAP, because I'm sure your hands are very valuable to you as a musician, and if there is something serious you need early treatment.\n\nAlso please visit wwww.arthritis.org for some backround on RA before your visit to the doctor so you can be more informed and ask the right questions so they can give you a proper diagnosis.\n\nIf it does turn out to be RA, push for early treatment, and visit the discussion boards at RA Connect on the arthritis.org site.  There you will find lots of people who are happy to give you support or info.\n\nPlease remember that there is no way to get a diagnosis except from your doctor, and there are many other, far less serious, things that could be causing your problem.  However, since it is similar to my situation I urge you to see a doctor in case it really is serious.

"Introduction to God:\nThere is only one God as the Holy Bible says. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! (Deuteronomy 6:4) We also know that the Bible gives attributes of deity to God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son of God, and the Holy Spirit of God. We also know that there are not three God’s, they are One.\n\nTrying to explain God with human understanding is very limited, because we are limited. We can only know about God by what He has revealed to us in His written Word, the Holy Bible. The Bible gives us enough information to know that we can trust God with our lives and believe that His word is truth. But we cannot understand all that there is to know about God from our human perspective.\n\nMan is created in the image of God so we can understand some things about God by looking at ourselves. There are three parts to humans we have a spirit, and a soul, and they are contained in a physical body, but they are one person. Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. (1STThessalonians 5:23) The following is a crude human analogy of God but it seems to fit with what we are taught in the Bible about God. The soul would relate to God the Father. The body would be Jesus the Christ, and the spirit of God would be the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe soul is a spiritual being, it is the mind, the heart, the control center of a person, the personality, it is the person. God the Father is Spirit. ""God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."" (John 4:24) \n\nJesus the Christ represents the body of God; He is God in physical form. For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, (Colossians 2:9). Just as the body receives and obeys commands from the soul, or mind, Jesus receives and obeyed commands from the Father. Jesus said that He only did what He saw the Father do and He only said what He heard the Father say. Then Jesus said to them, ""When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things. (John 8:28) Jesus was a sinless example of how we are supposed to be, in total obedience to the Father. The body is subject to the mind or soul.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the Spirit of love. I believe that the Holy Spirit unites the Father and Son as One; One in love, One in will, One in personality. The spirit that God has given man is what the world calls our conscience. Then the dust will return to the earth as it was, And the spirit will return to God who gave it. (Ecclesiastes 12:7) The spirit that God has given man is our source of life, (John 6:63). The moment that the spirit that God has given us departs from our body we are dead, (James 2:26).\n\nOur spirit gives us understanding of truth from God. But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding. (Job 32:8) Our spirit is always trying to unite us with God through Jesus Christ, who is the only way to God. ""Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him."" But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. (1 Corinthians 2:9-11) Our spirit is the only part of our being that we can trust. Our spirit reveals truth to us in the way that God sees truth. The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the innermost parts of his being. (Proverbs 20:27) \n\nHuman souls have inherited corruption from Adam’s sin, (Romans 5:12). Because a person is born a sinner he cannot trust his own soul, which is his heart. The natural tendency of our soul is to sin. Sin is disobedience to God a"
When HIV enters the bloodstream it infects cells that are crucial in the immune response to combat the virus. It takes about two weeks for the initial cells to become infected. The amazing thing is that the immune system rebounds and still works quite effectively although the virus exists in the body. Think of tracks in a recording studio or screens on a computer. The initial track or screen is the first cells responding. After they become infected they still work but at a very compromised rate. Then, a new track or screen starts working to replace the lost cells. After the new track is lowered another track or round of cells begin to respond. You get the idea.\n When all the tracks or screens are lowered to a certain point then HIV turns into what is diagnosed as AIDS. \n Applying this theory to any disease, it is then logical to say that if a certain track can overcome a microbe we have what is called spontaneous remission.

I would say that, this will vary greatly by the location or site that the security guard is at. If he has a patrolling type site he would be required to check the doors of each building throughout the night to insure they are secure as well as finding a B & E. He could be assigned to a car lot and then his job would be mainly to make sure no cars are stolen. He could be assigned to a construction site and his main duties would be to make sure no constructon equipment as well as building materials are not stolen. His duties may or should vary by job site.

Yes, i see him everyday in the faces of people, the people who suffer and the people who is happy, every of them are a little piece of God. If you understand, God is the power in your heart, is the power who makes you a better human being, if you can focus him on the feelings and the faces of the people around you..., if you can see feelings beyond your own feelings, then you have seen God. People frecuently ask why we had seen statues of God when we really dont know how he looks like, that is the answer, somebody had made this figure of him to make us know that he is one of us or every of us, is not a man or a woman, is not an adult or a child, is all of us and the power we have inside. The power to love and give, or the power to hate and destroy, the power we have to change things, that is God!.

Erythropoiesis is regulated by erythropoietin, which increases in the presence of hypoxia and regulates RBC production. In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production, so chronic renal failure is associated with anemia. Erythropoietin acts on the marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, to shorten maturation time, and to cause early release of reticulocytes. Other factors that affect erythropoiesis are the supply of nutrients (eg, iron, folate, or vitamin B12) and cell-cell interactions between erythroid precursors, lymphoid cells, and other components of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Factors that may suppress erythropoiesis include chronic debilitating diseases and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism or hyperestrogenism).

Closed 2wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nThis elegant bar directly opposite the Louvre has now become a bit of a Parisian institution: inside neo-colonial fans whirr lazily, oil paintings adorn the walls and even the bar staff seem to have been included in the interior decorator’s sketches. A sleek crowd sipping Martinis or browsing the papers at the long mahogany bar (originally from a Chicago speakeasy) gives way to young professionals in the restaurant and pretty young things in the library. It can feel a little try-hard and well-behaved, but some expertly mixed cocktails and a little friendly flirting with the PRs on the prowl are guaranteed to take the edge off the evening. \n\nHemingway Bar at the Ritz\nThe Ritz, 15 pl Vend? 1st (01.33.43.16.30.30). M? Madeleine or Concorde. \nOpen 6.30pm-2am Tue-Sat. Closed 3wks Aug. \nCredit AmEx, DC, MC, V. \n\nThis much lauded bar has become a cocktailers’ cliché, but that’s because it’s simply one of the loveliest places in Paris to do drinkies. The dark wood, muffled laughter, black-and-white photos of Papa H and the old-school charm of Colin the head barman and lovely Ludo his second, make the bar a cocoon from the horrors of the outside world. Leather seating and five-star service (a glass of berry-scented water appears within 30 seconds of arrival) preface cocktails are as near to alcoholic nirvana as possible - not least the divine raspberry Martini. Pulling in its fair share of characters, honeymooners and expense-account nerds, it’s also a wonderful place to see what the human race does in its spare time. Opened across the corridor is the Cambon Bar: the original Ritz bar, done up as it was back in its ’20s heyday.\n\nKong\n1 rue du Pont-Neuf, 1st (01.40.39.09.00). M° Pont Neuf. \nOpen noon-2am Mon-Sat. \nCredit AmEx, MC, V. \n\nPhilippe Starck’s latest addition to the Paris scene is, predictably, one of the city’s hottest places to do cocktails, ideally located on the top two floors of the Kenzo building overlooking the Pont Neuf. The bright mishmash interior is manga-inspired with lots of neon, Hello Kitty knick-knacks, comfy grey leather sofas and rocking chairs at the main dining tables, best avoided after a few too many coupes. The best bet is to perch at the long bar, flirt with the too-beautiful-to-bartend staff and order an excellent vodkatini or three. After dark you can make a music suggestion with each order - at weekends they somehow carve out a tiny dancing space for the trendy crowd to strut their stuff on. Wear lots of labels and try your best to look cool while half-cut. \n\n\nLe Couvent\n69 rue Broca, 13th (01.43.31.28.28). M° Les Gobelins. \nOpen 9am-2am Mon-Fri; 6pm-2am Sat. \nCredit MC, V. \n\nFor an address located in the middle of nowhere, this heavily beamed bar creates a delightful hideaway. It first appeared in Pierre Gripari’s two-part short-story collection Contes de la rue Broca, but it has come a long way since those dingy days. Nowadays it’s the chouchou of students and thirtysomething couples, especially at concert time when live chords get feet tapping. Always busy, always smoky. \n\nRhubarb\n18 rue Laplace, 5th (01.43.25.35.03). M° Maubert Mutualité. \nOpen

"It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

I think the main reason there is a war with Iraq is because Iraq has huge oil reserves. I do not see us stepping into the countries undergoing civil war in some parts of Africa or South America. \n\nWe did not even want to go into Serbia when the parties were conducting war crimes against humanity because the country had the 3rd largest army in Europe. \n\nI am sick of all this retoric about why we have to stand up for justice and bring democracy to the world....such BS...no wonder the world thinks that we are such pricks!
Becoming a tech is great career.\nBut you also need to realize that it is a very physically demanding job, there is a lot of lifting and moving patients around.\nAlso you want to make sure you have the stomach for the job as you will be working in many different areas of the hospital. To list a few: emergency room to do xray on trauma patients, intensive care unit, pediatric critical care unit, operating room as well you need to assist doctors to do gastic studies which include doing enemas.\nPersonally, I really enjoy my career choice but you do need to realize it is not jsut x-raying broken bones.\nAlso the schooling is quite intense, there is a lot of physics invovled in it.\nI attended school in Canada, which is suppose to provide you with a better educational base than the American program because it is more indepth.\nGood luck in the future if you have any more questions, let me know I am more than happy to help you out.\ntwitch1984@hotmail.com
You can join shadow shopper for a 5 buck trial for 30 days. IF you find lots of jobs, then u can sign on for the $60 membership. I tried it just because it was $5 and actually made $120.00 on my first job, which was at 6 or 7 different sites for the same company so it was all on one check and this place paid quickly. Well, i joined in feb so i missed canceling my membership by 1 day so had to pay the $60 but made about $500 last year mystery shopping, so i guess it was worth it. Plus you can write it off as a work expense on your taxes.

Satellite has broadband as its number one competition. Wireless internet services are growing faster than satellite radio can sign up customers. Therefore people with broadband will depend on online sources (radio, free sites, content providers) for their source of music etc. You can be sure that Disney (ABC, ESPN) GE (NBC) CBS CNN NEWSCORP (FOX) and others are all moving towards broadband broadcasting.\nSo far satellite radio has about 9-10 million paying listeners, there are over 100,000,000 cellphones in use around the world.
money market mutuals funds are invested in a variety of short term corporate & government notes. they fund takes a small percentage for managing the money. some money market funds are US Treasury only funds and invest in government obligations only. some invest only in municipal bonds to gain the tax free status.\n\nthe risk is that some of the investments default and the share price is not held at a constant $1.00.. you would lose money in that case. Most major fund companies would never let that happen to a money market fund as it would kill off most of their business. they have and would add the extra cash to keep the net asset value at $1.00.\n\nmoral of the story, buy money market funds from the best companies, vanguard.com, fidelity.com, troweprice.com, schwab.com ,etc.

There are many American citizens who live outside the country while retired. This is because the cost of living is usually much less than that in America. At this time, Vietnam's cost of living is approximately 1/8th that of living in America. You can live comfortable on about $300/month in Vietnam where you could barely live a week on that in America. That in mind, you can see why it is very attractive to live aborad while retired.\n\nHow most retired people are able to live in another country is rather simple. They maintain their U.S. citizenship, a U.S. address, pay their U.S. taxes and regularly travel back to the U.S. to pick up their mail and/or retirement checks. \n\nIf planning to live in Vietnam, you will need to make sure your visa will be valid long enough to stay as long as you are there. Vietnam had given the U.S. favored nation status a few years ago (although the favor has not been reciprocated as of yet), which will make it relatively easy to stay there as long as you want. \n\nHave a good retirement!

You will find the ¨Why¨ in Isaiah...14.12-14.17.\n\nSatan decided to go into heaven and to raise up his own throne above God´s.  He even thought he would be like God.\n\nBad career choice.  Isaiah 14.09 talks about the maggots and worms that now cover Satan.  \n\nAlso, Ezekiel 28.11 - 28.19.  His heart was lifted up by his own beauty.  God cast him to the ground.\n\nJesus saw him fall already.  Luke 10.18.  He said ¨I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven¨.\n\nThere is the Why and the verses.\n\nBut I also want to show you a different ending than some of the other answers.\n\nHere is another ¨why¨.  For this purpose, the Son of God came to the world, so that he might destroy the works of Satan.  1John 3.8\n\nAnd again...¨because He that is in you is greater than he who is in the world¨ 1John 4.4\n\nJust one more ¨WHY¨.  ¨And in the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed...it shall stand forever.¨ Daniel 2.44.\n\nHow is it that God plans to cast down Satan, set up a kingdom and destroy the works of Satan, if he really plans to send us all up in a rapture?\n\nFor those who care, I´m Jewish.\n\nThanks for the great question!

It is necessary to embrace your Karma.  To enhance life and your enjoyment of it, you should bring in positive vibes.  Look at the people with whom you surround yourself.  How do they effect your life?  Is there stress and anger in any of those relationship? One important factor is to free yourself from harmful and negative relationships and replace them with positive ones. Then you must look at your surroundings.. your home.. your job.. even your possessions.  All of this needs to bring a positive vibe to your life.  Surround yourself with items which please you and bring you peace.  Having a better life is all about attitude.  BELIEVE that you are able to improve your life and your attitudes and it will happen.

mutual funds are your best bet.  but you want to make sure that they are not actively managed, or you will end up paying for that management with you profits.  Also you need to remember to diversify your investments even more, so make sure your mutual funds hold investments in markets that are not highly correlated with one another.
"If you want a good sound when you are finished, I can think of only one way.  What you need is called a multi-track recorder.  You could search ebay for 4-track or 8-track recorders or ""studio recorders"".  What such a device will do is split the tape into 4 or 8 sections... each of which carries its own information.  For example, track-one might carry the drums recording, track-2 might have the bass-guitar recording, track-3 might include your media sample at the proper time...etc  (you get the idea).\n\n   When you have your tracks recorded, such a machine will output everything together to a line-out jack (usually a mini-plug like headphones, but sometimes a 1/4'' plug).  You can then record it all to one track of tape, cd, mp3, or whatever you can plug it into.\n\nNow, studio recorders used to be pretty expensive, but as computers have taken over their role in large part, you can often find used ones pretty cheap.  As I suggested, try ebay.  You may also find that a small local recording studio will do the mix for you for a small fee.\n\nI hope this helps you."

As what US is doing and many large corporates.\n\nSo within my fiedl I would like to be considered a thought leader and hence my investing too would be into areas that are strong on fundementals and be asset driven.\n\nIe - when you are younger - I would like to have failry less liquidity but more stock in risky but higher return sectors - like tech stocks and real estate and even commodities.\n\nBut as I age I would rebalance my portfolio to become less risky by moving more and more funds to fixed deposits and index related funds.\n\nSo I would go with my personal funding requirements and then match underlying assets that would provide return-risk profiles acceptable in each area.\n\nRight now I am building a part portfolio in euro to hedge a euro commitment at the latter part of the year.
Your best bet is to find a specialist recruitment company who deal with your area of expertise. Online job sites are now very popular and common in the UK and even big companies rely on them. Monster.co.uk is one of the biggest and many people use it.\n\nAlternatively try a specialist construction site:\nhttp://www.careersinconstruction.com/\n\nOr try searching the Yellow Pages business listings on yell.com for a specialist recruiter in the area you want to move to.

Mill Reef (1968-1986) was a champion thoroughbred racehorse.\n\nHe was owned and bred in America at the Rockey Stables by Paul Mellon. He was a son of Never Bend, out of the mare Milan Mill. Sent to England in December 1969 to be trained by Ian Balding, Mill Reef won the Epsom Derby in 1971, after having come second in the 2,000 Guineas to Brigadier Gerard. Mill Reef went on the win the Eclipse Stakes one month later, and in the same month, the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot. In October, he completed an extraordinary year by winning the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nKept in training as a four-year old, he did not have the same level of success, despite winning the Prix Ganay at Longchamp in April 1972, and, narrowly, the Coronation Cup at Epsom. He had the virus and in August broke a foreleg while training by stepping in a hole on the ground. He was saved, however, and went to the National Stud in 1973.\n\nMill Reef had a very successful career as a stallion, siring among others the winners in 1978 of both the Derby, Shirley Heights, and the French Derby (Prix du Jockey Club) Acamas.

The two on the back are the pictures of a sun and the moon clasing together in a new version that I kinda did with a little help from other tattoos. The one on my belly is a dragon around my belly button, and the one on my arm is a trival cross-they all represent strengh & spirituality because I believe is a sign of me and all the stuff I've gone through and I've been able to survive and fought for.

"I think you came to the right place for advice. Your friends gave you advice that will only get you in trouble. Thank them for their opinions, but try doing this instead:\n\n1. I'd sit down alone and write out some possible reasons my friend said that. Then I'd ask myself, ""Is this a normal way to behave for someone my age?"" I would be honest with myself. (my guess is that you are completely normal)\n\n2. Then, I'd stop and think about the day when my Mom would no longer be alive...(my mother is very ill right now, dying of a disease) And, I'd realize then:\n\n""My friends can just shove it! I love my mother and she loves me. I'm normal. Things will change when and if I want them to.""\n\nThen, if that girl teases you again, just ignore her and be glad you have a good mother."
Logarithmic charts are used for long-term charts.\n\nLet's take the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an example. It's currently trading around 11000 or so.\n\nIf we have a look at the Dow back to say 1940 (the dow was at 150), the start of the chart looks like almost a flat line from 1940 to 1955.  The Dow actually rows to almost 500 in 1955.\n\nThe problem with a linear scale is that takes the maximum levels into account.  So a rise from 150 to 500 (a three folder increase) looks insignificant compared to the period between 1990 (dow was around 2700) to 1998 (when the dow got to over 9000, yet they are both dramatic movements.\n\nSo by using a log/semilog scale we can compare the relative price movements rather than the physical point changes.\n\nSo, a 3 fold increase looks the same whether the it's from 150 to 450 or 2700 to 8100.\n\nSee the sources below for charts of the Dow showing the two different pricing scales.
The APR is the annual percentage rate.  When this number is divided by the number of legal banking days (used to be 360), you get the daily rate.  The balance due on your credit card on any given day is multiplied by the daily rate.  The product is then added to the original balance due and carried over to the next day, then multipled by the daily rate again, etc, etc, etc.  The finance charge per month is all the daily rates added together.

Friendship is a human relationship which involves mutual knowledge, esteem, and affection. Friends will welcome each other's company and exhibit loyalty towards each other, often to the point of putting the other's interests before one's own. Their tastes will be similar and may converge, and they will share enjoyable activities. They will also engage in mutually helping behavior, such as exchange of advice and the sharing of hardship. A friend is someone who may often demonstrate reciprocating and reflective behaviors. Yet for many, friendship is nothing more than the trust that someone or something will not harm them.
"*sighs* Real online jobs from home? This is a very good question, and the answer is real simple. The hard part is to find real opportunities. I did found some places that will help you find a for-real online job.\n\nFirst, search Craigslist and search for jobs under ""Telecommuting"". This way, only telecommuting jobs shows up. \n\nYou can also visit the other web sites I will list below. These websites will help you understand how to search for a job better.\n\nMy third suggestion? Be your own business! Market your skills for hire to companies. For example, if you are a writer, you can market your writings to magazines who are always looking for contributors. The best thing to do is to take a Learning Annex class that focus on marketing and developing yourself so you can work from home as a freelancer. If you don't live close to a Learning Annex, they have online classes that you can learn from. \n\nDon't be afraid to invest in yourself...\n\n... just make sure you don't invest money in looking for a connection. That's a waste of money and time.\n\nAnother bit of advice: check with the Better Business Beauru. But keep in mind: not all businesses registers with the BBB. I work with a client who have to pay a lot of money not only to get into the BBB, but it seems they want to make money from every angle, like if you have a website, you can't say you are a member of the BBB unless you register to be an online rep... even if you are not selling online.\n\nGood luck!"
1. People take advantage of everyone not just women.\n\n2. The truck salesman may have been dishonest, but it was your fault too. You should never buy a used auto without getting your own mechanic to check it out first. You should never sign a contract or loan agreement without understanding them. You should not buy from a dealer without checking with the BBB\n\n3. The bracelet charge was fixed I hope.\n\n4. Report the auto dealer to the BBB \n\nYou have to be a careful and educated consumer these days.

"Most people who work at home and are successful are doing one of two things - getting paid a commission on everyone they convince to join the program (also known as MLM or pyramid plans) OR they have their own business. Your own business is something you create yourself, not find on the internet. You create it based on your skills, your passions not on what someone else tells you is the GREATEST thing going.\n\nIf you are looking at one of the endless ""opportunities"" out there be careful - most are scams. Here are a few questions you should ask to help figure out if the one you are looking at is for real or not.\n\nLegitimate work-at-home program should tell you - in writing - what's involved in the program they are selling. Here are some questions you might ask:\n\n* What tasks will I have to perform? (Ask the program to list every step of the job.)\n* Will I be paid a salary or will my pay be based on commission?\n* Who will pay me?\n* When will I get my first paycheck?\n* What is the total cost of the work-at-home program, including supplies, equipment and membership fees?\n* What will I get for my money?\n\nIf you do not want to do the work from home deal - check out VocRehab - they are in business to help people with disabilities get employment."

"You need a lot of information.

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."""

"(m)\n\nVikramaditya\nAn ideal king who was as wise as he was brave and strong. He did not want kingship, but when the people needed him, became king. Matchless in war and matchless in forgiveness, an excellent ruler, he won the hearts of his people.\n\nVikramaditya - The Creator of an Era About 850 years ago the 'Chalukya- Vikrama Era' was in vogue in Karnataka. Vikramaditya the Sixth came to the throne on the 26th of February 1077A.D. The Chalukya-Vikrama Era commenced from that date. This shows his power and greatness. He defeated a number of kings and proved his valour. Can we respect a person as a great man, just because he is physically very strong or because he has an army and is powerful? Surely we cannot. The giants are said to have been very strong. All were afraid of them, but no one respected them. People hated them. One should have the wisdom to use one's strength for the benefit of others. A horse may be swift as the wind, but he needs reins to control him. In the same way power needs wisdom. Vikramaditya was both valiant and able. In spite of constant wars during his reign, the subjects lived without fear. His motto was to rule solely for the welfare of the people. In addition to this he was generous and noble. He treated a king, Jagaddeva by name, with such affection and grace that Jagaddeva gave up his kingdom andcame away to Vikramaditya's court. Vikramaditya the Sixth was second to none in valor. Many kingdoms were under his thumb but he used his might to help the good and punish the wicked. In every way he was worthy to give an era his name.  \nHarischandra\nWith his vow to remain truthful at all times, Harischandra successfully faced the rigorous challenge posed by Vishwamitra. Though a king. He sacrificed everything he had at the attar of truth, including his Kingdom, and even his life and son. He took so lowly a job as that of the guard at burning ground; even in the case of his own son he demanded the prescribed fee for cremation, which his wife had no means of paying. On an order from the king, Harischandra even prepared to behead his own wife. Harischandra's character is indelibly etched in the mind of Hindus.\n\nThe story of Harischandra is of perennial interest. The story will last for as long a time as the value of truth lasts. It illumines our life. It was this story which helped Yudhishtira to get over his adversities. Again, it was this story which showed the path of truth to Gandhiji. This story occurs in the Vedas and also in the Puranas, in poetry and in drama. It took its origin in the Vedas, flowed through the Puranas, ran into cascades of poetry, and has continued to enrich the life of our people. \n \nAshoka\nThe Wheel which adorns the flag of free India has kept his memory green. Lord of a vast empire, after a great victory sick of violence and took an oath never to fight again.He was an Ideal ruler.\n\n""All men are my children. I am like a father to them. As every father desires the good and the happiness of his children, I wish that all men should be happy always."" These are the words of an emperor who lived two thousand and three hundred years ago. We see in history how even mere chieftains grew arrogant and used their powers selfishly and unjustly. But the emperor who said the above words ruled over the greater part of India. He had the power of life and death over millions of his subjects. Is it surprising that free India remembers him with admiration? This emperor was Ashoka (also called ‘Devanampriya Priyadarshi’). The wheel in the abacus of the pillar which he erected as a memorial at Saranath now adorns the national flag of free India. --- Ashoka \nShivaji\nThe hero who escaped from the prison of the Mughal Emperor himself, to become the ruler of a kingdom devoted to Dharma and the service of the people. As a boy he dedicated himself to Hindu Dharma. He matched cunning against cunning, courage against courage; he was one of the wisest rulers as h"

So a store is always better plus you can goof off more in a store environment, easier to socialize as well, you can’t really do that while standing behind a counter while wearing a stupid hat and polyester pants.

lyric poem of 14 lines
I don't actually know you or your circumstances so it's impossible for me to answer with anything that would likely prove helpful to you. It sounds like a lot of this is self-perception. You seem really down on yourself, and that's never good. So the first thing you need to do is stop beating yourself up. Try being your best friend and promoter, for a start, ok?\n\nAre you shy around other people? You sound like you're probably an introvert and that's A-OK. But it does make it harder to open up with people and make friends. So you'll need to work on this too. Here's a tip: Confidence is very attractive to people. I'm not talking about arrogance or being aloof. I'm talking about projecting a positive self-image, which you do as much with your body language as spoken language. Look people in the eye and don't be afraid to express yourself. \n\nThere is no easy fix to what you're describing, though my sense is that you're feeling particularly down just now. Take it one step at a time and don't trip yourself up with negative thinking, ok? There is only one you on the planet. So treat yourself with more respect and others will too. Good luck...\n\nAnd hold your head high! :)

"In an argument, one arguer may twist and distort his opponent's position until his position is grossly misrepresented.  He may then attack the distorted position (the straw man) which will be easy to attack.  However, since he has attacked a straw man rather than the real position of his opponent, his argument is fallacious.\n\nAn example would be as follows:\n\n""The Senator wants to abandon the new submarine programme.  I don't understand why he wants to leave the nation defenceless.""\n\nHere, the Senator just wants to abandon one particular submarine programme.  Instead of exploring the Senator's reasons for being against this particular programme, the arguer pretends that he wants to ""leave the nation defenceless"".  This is a straw man which will be easy to attack but the argument is fallacious because the Senator never said that he wants to leave the nation defenceless.\n\nAnother example, from a domestic argument, would be:\n\nJill: ""We should clean out the closets. They are getting a bit messy."" \nBill: ""Why, we just went through those closets last year. Do we have to clean them out everyday?"" \nJill: ""I never said anything about cleaning them out every day. You just want too keep all your junk forever, which is just ridiculous.""\n\nThere are two straw men here.  Jill never said that the closets should be cleaned every day and Bill never said that he wants to keep all his junk forever!"

sounds about right, maybe just a LITTLE too harsh, but I think the punishment should be something like that.  the 10 PM curfew and any alcohol in the house and you go to jail parts are a little tough.  However if he does have a family to suport he needs to learn to NEVER drink and drive this punishment is better for his family then having him dead in a car crash because the punishment wasn't harsh enough. What about the other guy in the car crash?  He might have a family too.

The human mind is difficult to understand now, and even though you may improve, the effects are temporary.  If you get sick of pyschiatric treatment, just pretend you've gotten better, or actually get better through some soul-searching or daily excercise."

Title does not automatically qualify it as a motor vehicle.  Houses have title as well.  The title is tied to the property and the deed is the proof of ownership.  You can contact your local city/state agency or call a title company and they will be able to help you find what you need (for a fee of course!)  I don't think auntiegray really understands the question.  Do not go to Motor Vehicles if you do not have a motor home.  Manufactured housing does not necessarily mean motor home.  You do not have the DEED for your property.  You physically transfer the deed whan selling a home, the title stays with the house.  If you are going thru professional channels to sell this house i.e. a realtor, broker, or lender, they can refer you to a title company/attorney who will do that for you and you do not have to waste a lot of time trying to track the deed down.\n\nGOOD LUCK!
If you get a personal loan for the amount of your down-payment, many mortgage lenders will not like that. They want you to have good credit and some type of savings. even if you get a down payment from something like inheritance or as a gift, you may need to show where the money came from before you can get a mortgage. I know it sucks, but your best bet is to try to repair your credit, and save money, THEN buy a home.

There are different legal systems that govern nations.Therefore it is difficult to pin point the exact requirements that need to be met.I would think that the universally accepted reqirements are:\nthat there needs to be a lease agreement drawn up, which stipulates the terms and conditions of the agreement , like to period , payment etc.However i am unsure about the manner eviction should take because that's different arouond the world.Regardless, the most imporatant thing is the lease agreement. if you have any other legal problems you can e-mail me.
Elba: An island of Italy in the Tyrrhenian Sea between Corsica and the mainland. Napoleon Bonaparte spent his first period of exile here (May 1814-February 1815).\n\nSaint Helena: A volcanic island in the southern Atlaantic Ocean west of Angola. Together with Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, it forms the British dependency of Saint Helena, occupied by the British since the mid-1600s. Napoleon was in exile here after his defeat at Waterloo in 1815 until his death in 1821.

Also, try to deal with someone who has access to several insurance companies, not just one. Last bit of advice, try to find a Certified Financial Planner near you. CFP's have a higher level of responsibility to their clients than an insurance agent.

Unique in the way that it went on under the radar for so long by most people on the planet. Few knew of the gas chambers and what went on until the war ended, even most Germans didn't know. Unique in the scale of genocide. Have you ever counted just one million of anything? Unique in that it could never happen again in such secrecy. Everyone new the Jews were imprisoned, even the Catholic church. But the holocaust was a secret until the end of the war. And hopefully it will always stay unique forever until time ends! Amen

365 days in a year, divided by 12 equals 30.416.  So you make every other month 30 days and the rest 31.  Then you find that there is one left over with 28 days.  What do you do with that month?  You call it February and stick it in the middle of Winter.  :-)

Wow you sound a little conceited in your ideals for yourself. Whose judgments are using to gauge your results. I find it hard to believe that you never hurt anyone. How do you know you are a good wife, whose standards are you following. How do you know you are a good parent? \n I think I am a decent wife, though not perfect by any means. My children have grown into decent hardworking adults for the most part. I am disabled and totally housebound except for maybe once a month getting out to see my grandkids. I believe I am an open minded person who can see more than alot of people because of the hardships and life I have had to live. I don't mean to ever hurt anyone, but I know that I have when I have said things in anger, or said something without thinking. I am as good as I can be I guess. Far from perfect, perfectly human.
if you figure it out let me know. I have been trying to figure that out all my life.

I love being in nature and learning about how plants and animals live in an ecosystem- but I cannot read scientific abstracts even though I am a college graduate.\n\nWhen I want to learn something - I look for books on a third grade reading level.  Seriously, I was able to learn what I needed about viruses from a third grade level book written by Howard and Margery Facklam.\n\nYour other option is to find a tutor.  I am not ashamed that when I was losing my way in French - I got another student to tutor me.  \n\nIf you cannot work it out with a student - go to either your science teacher or another science teacher you feel comfortable with and ask for help.\n\nTeachers love to see students ""get it,"" so don't be afraid to share that you are confused by some of your assignments."
Hahaha! Right, you go for it man! No fear!\n\nFor real though, that is the stupidest idea ever.

Getting into the film industry is not an easy.  You will need to determine your own strategy.  Some people creat short films and enter them into competitions with the hope of some one seeing them.  Some write scripts and seek financing.\n\nMy strategy is to start with a Video podcast (www.danandstan.com).  It gives me exposure, lots of feedback, and a portfolio if you will.  It is my hope I can use this to get finance to make a larger budget film.\n\nJust make sure you like creating the films and can get off your butt to do it.

Well, besides looking in your local newspapers, you could begin by going to the area service station which have auto service facilities.  These establishments rent/lease out their service pits to people/mechanics for a fee.  Then, you are required to get your own business insurance along with whatever else is needed.\nKeep in mind, with gas/service stations, at least here in Michigan, the owners all know each other.  So once you begin your search, chances are you will be referred to the right location.\nHope this information proves to be useful.
First of all, not everyone was made to be manager nor to work in management. \nA good manager can handle situations without showing how they feel. They treat each employee as an individual; some are not able to think fast and some think too fast. What one can give, the othere may not. Just treat your employees with respect and do not ask more of them than what they can do. You do have to know who is worthy of the job and who is just lazy.

You need to see an attorney about this. There ARE cases where that is possible. Usually this is settled in probate.
You can buy stocks at any age as long as you have an adult to help you set up the account.  Just go to etrade.com or something and set up an account.  It's not hard, but you need a checking account I think.  Then transfer money from your checking account into your e-trade account.  Then go online and you can use that money to buy stocks.  \n\nUsing the web site, just decide which stock you want to buy (they all have a letter abbreviation), see how much it costs, and then figure out how many you can buy with the money in your account.  (they charge you about 20 dollars each time you make a purchase).   Then click the BUY button and you've bought it!  Once you buy the stock online, then you own it.  You don't actually get it, instead shows up in your e-trade account so you can sell it whenver you want.  \n\nThe price will move up and down over the hours/days/months as people buy and sell the stock.  The price is always the price of the last transaction and will go up when the stock gets more popular and down when it gets less popular.  \n\nThings that make it popular (go up) is that the company makes more money or makes a good deal, or hires a good executive, or buys another company which is very good, or something like that.\n\nThings that make it less popular (go down) is when the company loses money, or gets sued, or something happens where it might lose money in the future, like it's customers plan on spending less, or the price of something it needs to run (like gasoline) becomes more expensive.\n\nWhen you are ready, just go back to the web site and click the button to sell the stock.  The money will appear in your account (minus anohter 20 bucks) and if you did well, you will end up with more money than you started with, and you can transfer it back into your bank account, etc.....\n\nIf you have a job, put a little bit each paycheck into your stock account, and then when it hits about 500 dollars buy some stock.  You pay 20 dollars no matter how much you buy so it's better to buy every once in a while instead of once a week!\n\nIt's not so much buying a good stock as it is buying a stock that you think is cheaper than it should be and will become more popular later.\n\nFor exmaple If you notice that the stock for some clothing store has been sitting around $30 for the last year (the e-trade web site has all this information), but you recently noticed that everyone is starting to shop there and it's getting really popular, then buy the stock at $30.  Pretty soon other people will realize that hte store is making money and the stock will get popular, and the price will go up, maybe to $50 for example etc....  then when you sell it, you'll get back $50 for every $30 you bought!  (minus the $20 sell fee).  You can transfer it back to your checking account and spend it or use it to buy more stock!  (it can get addictive).\n\n\nGood luck!
I doubt it but you could be the first to offer him an olive branch.  Just because your relatives can't seem to get along doesn't mean the both of you can't.  However, be prepared for the eventuality that he may not want to resume ties with you.  There is a reason why the past is past. But you can try. Usually though, they don't like hearing about your present love interests.  If you haven't been in touch in a couple of years, that means he's moved on and so should you.  Why don't you just get perspective on your love life now with your other girl-friends instead of your ex?
no. you would never get away with anything. everyone lies at some point in their life... it wouldnt be half as much fun if people knew you were lieing
That depends what your degree is in and what field you're planning on getting into. I'll be going to grad school, but that's because my field pretty much requires it... \n\nEdit: Well, for careers in physics, you'd probably want a graduate degree. Try to get a part-time assistant position (in a University or a lab, etc.) while you earn your masters.

I don't know how old you are, but try to hangout with the guy: maybe work on homework together or invite him and his friends to hang out with you and your friends. Pay attention to him but be cool about it-NO tripping, getting over-excited or stalking or acting obsessed. If he gets the clue and tells you he likes you-mission accomplished! If he seems interested but you get the feeling he is too shy to admit he likes you then just casually ask him to hangout, just the two of you this time. If he doesn't seem interested play it cool and let it slide, you don't want to lose a friend and besides there are plenty of guys out there who would like a thoughtful girl like you. Good luck!!!

Suprise, suprise!  Bacteria grows better in acidic environments.  Remember, if you eat something with bacteria on it, it goes into your stomach where it's very acidic, and you still get sick.  The reason the water broke your hypothes is as follows...\n\nThe orange juice, just like other food, is treated with extreme ultraviolet light at the factory.  The ultraviolet light kills the bacteria.  The water that you used may not have been treated with ultraviolet light.  This means that the water actually had bacteria in it, whereas the orange juice did not.\n\nI hope this helps.

They take an awful lot of energy to smelt them, either one. Generally, the melting point of alloys is lower than the melting point of the individual ingredients, so perhaps an alloying material could be discovered/ developed, which would reduce the temperature at which the steel or glass had to be melted. If you can do that, you'll be rich. Good Luck!

"Usually, you feel this familiar sensation after you've been putting pressure on part of our body -- sitting on a foot, sleeping on an arm, etc. When you apply this pressure for a prolonged period of time, you actually cut off communication from your brain to parts of your body. The pressure squeezes nerve pathways so that the nerves can't transmit electrochemical impulses properly. Nerve impulses carry sensation information from nerve endings in the body to the brain, as well as instructions from the brain to the parts of the body. When you interfere with this transfer by squeezing the nerve pathways, you don't have full feeling in that body part, and your brain has trouble telling the body part what to do.\n\nThis pressure can also squeeze arteries, stopping them from carrying nutrients to body cells. Without these nutrients, the nerve cells may behave abnormally, which can further interfere with communicating bodily sensations.\n\nDue to both these factors, the information transmitted from the body part becomes somewhat jumbled, and the brain receives strange messages. Some nerve cells don't transmit any information and others start sending impulses erratically. This causes you to feel a strange tingling sensation, which actually serves an important function. Your foot falling asleep for 10 minutes doesn't pose any health threat, but if you were to cut off circulation for an extended period of time -- several hours -- you could suffer serious nerve damage. The initial tingling sensation tells you that you might want to readjust your position.\n\nOnce you do move your foot, stretch your legs, or roll over off your arm, the nerve impulses begin to flow properly again. You don't regain feeling right away, however. There is a certain amount of re-adjustment time before the nerves transmit impulses correctly again. This increases the intensity of the tingling, causing the familiar ""pins and needles"" sensation."

idontknow has a pretty low opinion of people who sign up for military service, seems that idontknow thinks you may not have figured out that our military is deployable by now.  Your recruiter (if he did his job) answered all of your questions, told you about programs that you may be qualified for and helped you make an informed decision.  \n\nWhat he didn't tell you is what you didn't ask about or told him you weren't interested in.  Why would he go on about how great the GI Bill is when you already told him you weren't really interested in college.  If you told your recruiter that you wanted to be play with explosives, why would he tell you about all the great opportunities in administrative fields.  \n\nLook, there aren't any real secrets out there.  You have a brother, cousin or friend in the NG ask them or ask your recruiter.  Your NG recruiter has to do something you average AD recruiter doesn't... he has to see you every drill weekend.  It's not in his interest to fill you up with too much BS.\n\nYes, we ALL know that you may fall into a rotation in Afghanistan or here in Iraq with me... don't sweat it.  It's a post 9/11 world and military service is never going to be the same again.

Talk to your friends/relatives in the NG or on regular AD they're not gonna BS you.

I switched my college major from Fine Art to Accounting after I saw that there was not going to be an occupation for me from the BFA.  I changed my major to accounting because I was told that was where reliable jobs could be found.\n\nI hated my classes.  I was FORCED by scheduling problems to take an elective in Computer Sciences.  \nI sat in that class and worried for two days because I couldn't for the life of me see what was hard, and figured I must be COMPLETELY MISSING IT to not know.\nBy the end of the week, I changed my major again.\n\nHad I been given a personality test, all of that could have been avoided:\nHere is a link to a Kiersey temperament sorter.  The basic test is free, and it will sort you into a type, such as INTJ, that can be associated with occupations.  They give an overview of the qualities of each type.  \n\nThis will either tell you WHY you are in accounting or tell you where you ought to go to get out.\nhttp://www.personalitytype.com/quiz.asp\nEdit: Changed link, old link no longer giving free results.

For each survey, you earn points (the points differ from survey to survey).

I actually have been following and buying this stock for quite some time... i have over 5 thousand shares, and i am very happy with it. they are an up and coming company that deals withwireless donloading, and deal primarily in europe, although i believe they are poised to explode to a global business. what they do is use cellular transmission to download music to a cell phone or wireless computer very fast. if you were to request a song, all the towers in the area would bombard you with data for a very short period of time, like poissibly 10 seconds. you would get parts of the song (or file) from many towers,at one time, and it would build on your phone or device. you can d/l a song in just a few seconds. of course they charge per song... currently, they only work with one music company (BMG recording i think) so there is a somewhat limited catalog of songs to choose. but as they become more broad, and move into more ares, i think they could easily associate with many more music companies. this is a company with the possibility to explode especially in urban areas where cell phone towers are every couple blocks. At 48 cents a share, i believe you cant go wrong. but expect to hold for up to 3 years or so, depending on the growth, it may take a while, you never know. i have bought at as low a i think 41 cents, and i sell if it surges to 75 cents or more. but i never suggest day trading. i think it would be a wise buy and hold stock. My honest expectations for this stock are upwards of 9-10 dollars over the coming years.\n\nhope this helped

Well, people who are doped up generally are not very responsible or productive workers, so if a company hired those types of people productivity would decrease. Also a doped up employee is a bad representation of the company image, and can be a liability to the company if they do something stupid to hurt themselves or their coworkers.  \n\nHiring druggies can lower productivity, loose customers, and pose a thretening envirnment for coworkers, all of these will cost the ompany money and productivity.
You have to call each of the credit card companies you have an account with and negotiate to lower your rate. Tell them that you're not doing so good and outline your income situation. Tell them that you're considering filing for bankruptcy but really don't want to if they lower your interest or reduce the amount. \n\nOr, if you can find a credit card that has very low interest rates that can accomodate all your other credit cards, then consolidate.

Bipolar disorder, often referred to colloquially as manic depression, is a diagnosis describing low (clinically depressed) and high (manic or hypomanic) mood swings significantly broad enough to interfere with an individual's ability to function on a daily basis. Such mood disorders are thought to affect millions of people.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder, specifically, an anxiety disorder. OCD is manifested in a variety of forms, but is most commonly characterized by a subject's obsessive drive to perform a particular task or set of tasks, compulsions commonly termed rituals.\n\nOCD should also not be confused with OCPD, the similarly named but notably different obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which psychiatric guidelines define as a personality characteristic rather than an anxiety disorder.

Yea...that belongs in jokes and riddles.
This is a fact of life in a free market economy where a company is traded on an exchange.  To prevent the possibility of hostile takeovers would have the effect of undermining the possiblity for many companies to raise capital by going public.  \n\nJust because it is called a hostile takeover doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad.  It simply means that a majority share of a target publicly-traded company is being acquired by another entity against the wishes of the board, stock holders and even the employees.  One doesn't do this with the hope of maintaining morale and good will, as everyone in the target firm resent it and fear losing their jobs.  It is usually done by the taking company to gain a competitive advantage of some type, like market share, technology, properties, assets, etc.  \n\nHowever, if stock is traded freely on the exchange, it has to be the same for everyone, regardless of intention.  How the takeover is conducted is subject to certain regulations, though.  A merger that would create an unfair competitive advantage, hostile or not, has to be approved by the SEC.

The first part I not sure about. But in the US you have to be 18 years old before you are legally an adult. But somethings are still resisted till you are 21. Like alcohol, some clubs, gambling (in some states) Basically at 18 you can sign your 'own name' on documents, open accounts. You don't need your parents to sign your documents (contracts). Unless it is a cosigning like a house or car, then you need an adult to sign with you. Cosigning is when an adult says they are responsible for you paying. IF YOU MISS UP IT HURTS THEIR CREDIT TOO

Risk might be equated to uncertainty: uncertainty about achieving your investing goals. Usually, proffesional aproximmate uncertainty with standard deviation.\nbasically that's all behind risk perception.\nNow, covariance is a measure about how returns on one assets might be relate to ohters'. In order to calculate the standard deviation of a portolio , you need a covariance matrix:\nse = sqrt( X'CX) where se is standard deviation of the return, sqrt stands for square root, X is a vector of portfolio holdings and C is a covariance matrix.\nBeta is the regression coefficient of one asset's returns with respect to the market returns. It an easy and dirty way to approximate the std deviation of given asset. However, its not much more difficult to express assets returns as a linear function of several factors. That is called multivariate analysis or, in financial jargon, APT (arbitrage pricing theory). \nIf the returns are expressed as linear combinations of factors and F is factor weighting matrix (entries being securities and factors), C can be calculated as \nC=F'M f where M is the factor covariance matrix.\n\nnow, we have been talking about absolute risk. What is relevant, however is risk relative to goal (benchmark) for doing that you have to measure tracking error, which is de std dev of the differences in return between the benchmark and the portfolio.\nSystematic risk is the risk that can be avoided by diversifiing de portfolio. Unsystematic risk is the risk that is inherent to the underlying market

"Despite the resistance, insurance companies are finding they must turn to new, unexplored avenues for cost reduction. \n\nThe industry has not made an underwriting profit in almost a decade. Up until recently, insurers were able to survive -- and in many cases do quite well -- because they made up losses through investment and asset management income. But 2001 proved to be a turning point. \n\nLast year was one of the most dismal underwriting years ever, and the asset management side of the insurance business began to falter due to the sinking stock market and volatility in the credit markets. \n\nMoreover, there was increased competitive pressure on insurance firms from financial services companies. \n\nInsurers are, of course, embracing all the prescribed measures for tough times, such as tighter underwriting requirements and participation in industry e-commerce endeavors. \n\nNevertheless, industry watchers and participants are witnessing a distinct movement toward CRM in the insurance sector as a novel way to beat the odds. \n\n""An insurance company is always interested in avoiding loss, whether that loss is paid out through settlements or through excessive administrative overhead,"" Aberdeen Group research director Denis Pombriant told CRMDaily."
"Really bad info posted here.\n\nLets start with the basics.\n\nBy law you can get all 3 of your credit reports free at www.annualcreditreport.com once per year.\n\nNow for credit scoring, the ONLY credit score that lenders look at is a FICO credit score. Unfortunately it is not free. You can get your FICO credit score from Equifax for $7.95 but that is only one credit bureau. \n\nWhen you apply for a mortgage the lender will pull all 3 credit bureaus and ""price"" your loan from the middle score, so you really need to know all 3 of your FICO scores.\n\nOnce you have reviewed your credit reports for accuracy and disputed any items that you believe to be inaccurate you can go to www.myfico.com/12 and get all 3 of your FICO scores for $45.00. This will also give you the top 4 reasons as to why your credit scores aren't higher.\n\nWhen you have all 3 of your FICO credit scores you can do some rate shopping before you apply. www.bankrate.com has calculators to determine what you can afford and in the mortgage section you can see a table of potential lenders with accurate rates in your local area.\n\nAlso go to www.myfico.com and look in the Credit Education section to see how credit scores work.\n\nGood Luck"

Yes, your broker is right.  However, if you will pay just an extra 50 bucks a month, you will DRASTICALLY lower your principal balance, saving literally thousands of dollars over the life of the loan if you keep it more than a couple of years.  Another great way to lower your principal is to split your monthly mortgage payment into 4 WEEKLY payments, this will attack your principal balance quickly.  You will want to make sure your lender will accept this type of payment (although they sure won't LIKE it, due to loss of interest on their part).\n\nIt is up to you what type of loan you get.  Ask questions to prospective lenders.  You shouldn't have to pay interest that hasn't accrued (what you would pay if you went through the entire life of the loan). If that is what they are proposing...LOOK INTO OTHER LENDERS..this is not standard practice.  \n\nHomes will normally gain value over time, if kept well.  You may not come out ahead a lot over just a few years, but you should have some equity (value) built up.\n\nGood luck....ask questions...no question is dumb.

"The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone"" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content.

I made tons of money when your age by getting stencil numbers and neatly painting address on curbs. I would first paint a square of white using spray can and cardboard do 3 houses then go back and spray black numbers using stencil when the white was dry.  Next week I would go around at dinnertime and say I was working my way through school and I was the one who painted their curb. If they could donate something fine, if not, enjoy the numbers and they are free.   I made lots of friends and made lots of money not to mention all the dinner invitations.   Selling stuff on ebay for yourself or others and making a percentage of the sale is another good way.  contact me if you want more details on either projects.

Depends on you proof of claim. If you are unsecured you go to bottom of the list and you will get little or no money. If you have a lien on property you go to the top of the list as a secured creditor and can get almost full value. If you are a contractor and filed a mech lien or whatever they have in your state against the property that you did work on you should get paid. It also depends on the sitiuation if you are commercial or residental contractor. Lots of factors to take into account.

"It depends on the status of the tax sheltered annuity(TSA).  If the TSA is an IRA, 403(b), 401(k) or some sort of account that you took a tax deduction on your tax return the year(s) you made contributions, then you can roll it to an IRA CD at the bank. Look carefully at your statement from the TSA and see if it says IRA or 401(K) or 403(b) or ""qualified account"" close to where your name or account number is located.  If you added money to this account thru a payroll deduction plan, it probably is an account that can be rolled to the IRA CD.\nA TSA can also be what is called a non-qualified account, meaning that you put after-tax dollars into the account. These TSA accounts cannot be rolled over to a CD.\nIt is often times hard to get the TSA company or their representative to help you with you questions about moving money OUT of their company. However, the bank where you want to move the money to should have a representative that is more than willing to help you figure out how to move money TO their bank.  Take your TSA statement to the bank and ask for their help.  I disagree with the previous answer about getting help from the TSA company."

Sure it is a marketing ploy. It is used to communicate to users that the website they are using is hacker safe, thus instilling trust in customers. The leading reason why some people still don't shop on the web is fear of getting their information hacked and out to criminal elements.\n\nMany websites who use certifications from Hacker Safe, for example has shown increase in conversions. And if you are a retailer, a 2% or 10% increase in conversion is a BIG THING. It's one thing to get traffic, but another to convert that traffic into sale. And if getting hacker-safe certifications would do it, etailers will do it.\n\nThe leading outdoor lifestyle company Woolrich, according to a June 30 press release issued, tested this premise and used ScanAlert’s Hacker Safe certification on the site. ScanAlert is a company that “conducts comprehensive daily security audits of ecommerce infrastructure and then certifies the security of it in real-time by allowing the HACKER SAFE certification mark to appear only when a site`s current status meets the highest published government industry standards.” \n\nThe company used two control groups of shoppers to test the impact of the Hacker Safe certification. During the three-week test displaying the certification, Woolrich shoppers who saw ScanAlert’s HACKER SAFE certification mark while visiting woolrich.com produced significantly more orders compared to the control group. Woolrich attributes the certification to improving their website’s already high conversion rate by 3 percent.

Consider this:\nMake a list separately of what you both want, enjoy, need - pay no attention to order or anything esle. Then get together and compare, here you can eliminate or even add to a single list you agree on. Then place them in order of importance, please no arguing - if it is important to you (or him) then it is - no matter what you (or he) thinks. Now we have a list, next place a time next to them. House - 3 years, vacation - 1 year etc. Then put dollar amounts next to them - house deposit needed $10,000 divide that by 36 (3 years x 12) you now have a monthly value. Once you have done this you will see that you have monthly values for the things you are trying to do. Then add up everything and get a monthly total. You'll either have enough to do it all or not enough to do it all. Then sit down again and work out what you can eliminate or reduce - 'stuff' once every two months is cheaper than 'stuff' every week. House deposit in 4 years instead of three etc - Once you can see what you can achieve, and you are both on board, then it is easy to do. This may take a few talks, so get coffee and cookies and sit in a nice and comfortable room.\n\nAt some point you may want to show him what you do to pay the bills etc. Alternatively you can have a lot of the bills paid automatically (I do not like this) where you give the utility company your credit card (or checking account)# and they deduct it automatically, every month. Pay everything with a credit card and have the bank deduct the payment from your checking account every month. All bills then get paid automatically - you just need to then monitor that there is enough money in your account, AND that the statements you get are accurate.\n\nGood Luck!

Get out the yellow pages and call companies in your field and ask if you can fax over your resume and to who's attention. You can follow up in a week with a call to that person. Take a look at your resume. Is it full of gobbledegook about you are looking for a meaningful job or discusses your character instead of what work you can do? Employers want to see a specific job objective like to find a sales trainee position where I can use my strong interpersonal skills. Stuff about finding a meaningful job goes in the garbage esp if you can't say what kind of job you are looking for. You should also be telling everyone you knows including relatives that you are looking for a job. Also apply for civil service jobs and look on the websites of the school systems

if your employer is unwilling to send you copys (and they're required by law to have at least 5 years on file) the I.R.S. can help. - I know - I had to amend my 03 return and didn't have it - they printed it right up in their office for me
Of course they take a SMALL commissioned rate if you sell something that's well a grand or something.  But the listing fees are small, and if you own a ebay Store on the site it costs you 10 bucks a month for it.  But they do not take your profits.  That only occurs when you sell something that gets in the very high price ranges, like 500 to 1,000 dollars or more.  I've sold and brought items from eBay for over five years, and I've never had eBay make  profit from it.  Go to the site and check out their rules and regulations.  Good luck.
That's fine IMHO, but be aware that many people, even those with kids, still don't have Internet access at home.\n\nIf you're not allowed to use the home phone for this, or aren't allowed to have a regular cell phone, I suggest getting a prepaid cell phone like Tracfone or Virgin Mobile for yourself.  That way you can show responsibility by keeping up the number, and they don't cost all that much if you keep the number of calls down (like just mostly using it for getting requests for babysitting).\n\nIn any case having a cell phone is a definite safety thing with the apparent increasing number of creeps out there.
The Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\n\nFor me, advertising is the best way to make money online because you do not carry any inventory or be hassled with delivery and fulfillment unlike when you're selling through your own ecommerce store or ebay.\n\nBut here are the main business models you can adopt:\n\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \n\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\n\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or PowerHomeBiz.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\n\na. Advertising - whether by joining banner ad networks such as Tribal Fusion, BurstMedia or Fastclick and display the banners on their site; or through contextual advertising such as Google Adsense or Intellxt\n\nBanner ad networks:\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \n\nContextual Advertising Networks:\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/... \nYahoo!

Paid online content. Hoovers.com or WebmasterWorld.com Supporters forum all require paid subscription before accessing the information\n\nd. Content licensing and syndication. Some publishers such as the Associated Press get paid every time their content is published elsewhere\n\n3.

I think the best answer would be false.  The cost of common stock is the current fair market value of the stock as determined by the company's worth when taken into consideration along with the number of shares of common stock being traded.  What shareholders want the cost to be has nothing to do with the price of the stock.

"i think we, the US, are coming to the market standard, and it might just be possilbe the price of oil is high as well.\nthere is alot of talk these days of peak oil and such, but there has been sort of recently research and a growing theory that oil is perhaps a renewable resource (a google search for ""oil renewable resource"" will turn up some articles on this if you are interested.  i'm not sure what to make of it and if i've just been so beaten with the idea that one day it will out that i'm overly resistant to this idea or what....but if this does turn out to be true, then there seems to be no reason from a scarity angle that the price should keep climbing...but then would oil companies really promote the fact that oil might not run out?\n\nbut yeah, given the price in the rest of the world, i think we are hitting the standard price now."

Seriously dude, you will get kicked out as an audit. You MUST have a qualifying child to qualify for head of household. They changed the rules this year. You have to provide more than 50% of the household maintenance and income for a qualifying CHILD to get head of household. Before your audit comes, I would call the IRS and explain to them. The IRS won't accept it and if you end up refiling late, you'll pay penalties. You are not a qualifying dependant of yourself. Qualifying dependant is what the answer before me stated.

it sounds like it is time for you to document EVERYTHING you do every day for a week and make up a spreadsheet of tasks for each day and then what gets accomplished and what doesn't.\n\ntake this to him and explain that you feel a little overwhelmed by you duties and you would appreciate some help in identifying the A items (priorities) and C items (things that can wait until the next day). ask your boss what his expectations are for your accomplishments each day. if he says you are doing great, then stop sweating the lists and get them done when you can and make sure you're getting the priorities completed each day.  i'm sure there's bound to be days where there aren't lists, or theya re short enough that you get a sense of completion.  if not then bring this to his attention also.  if you are stressing about work in your personal life, then you are overwhelmed and he needs to know how it is affecting you.  perhaps some of your tasks could be given to someone who doesn't have as much to do as yourself.\n\nmany people feel that they can't get their job done each day, but that's why you keep going back...b/c it's work adn it's your job.  think of those lists as your job security. get done what you can and get to the rest the next day.\n\ngood luck and be sure to have evidentiary proof when dealing with your boss.  portray yourself professionally and not whiny and complaining.

"The best way is to rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you're only going to read one how-to guide to get to the top of Google, the BEST and most comprehensive resource I found is WebmasterWorld.com's Brett Tabke's advice ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone"" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm\n\nOther ideas:\n\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \n\n3. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. PRWeb and my website accepts free press release submissions, among others.\n\n4. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Here is a VERY COMPREHENSIVE list of sites that accept article submissions  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AqmzHU_wN2q8JvMJ6ttE0ewjzKIX?qid=1006022407481 \n\n5. Syndicate your content. Use blog or RSS feeds to distribute your content. Everytime you update your content, those who are receiving your RSS feeds will get the latest info from you as well.

"The only way the stock market would crash again is if everyone borrows money from banks to invest in stocks and never pay the money back. For example buyer A borrows money from the bank and buys stock. buyer A then sells his stock, that he has earned profit off of, to buyer B. buyer B has borrowed money from the bank to purchase from buyer A. buyer b then takes that stock and sells back to buyer A. Buyer A then has borrowed money from the bank to afford the price of the stock buyer B has asked for. this goes on and on, borrowing money from the banks and niether of the buyers has payed the banks back which makes the banks go into default and this results in a stock market crash. so as long as people do not borrow too much money and pay back their loans, we should not have to worry about a depression. Although someone once said.....""HISTORY DOES REPEAT ITSELF"""

"There are two differences between being laid off and being terminated, is how you are treated for the purposes of unemployment insurance. \n\n1. A person who is laid off is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits, while a person who is terminated for a justifiable reason, (i.e., ""for cause"") is not entitled, because that person brought the loss of employment on him/herself.\n\n2. A person who is laid off in a ""cause"" jurisdiction, i.e., a State in which an employee cannot be terminated for a reason unrelated to their employment, is entitled to sue for ""wrongful termination,"" if the employee can show that the employer used the layoff as a means of avoiding the cause requirement associated with a termination.\n\nHowever in an ""at-will"" jurisdiction, an employer needs no reason to terminate an employee, and the only time that an employee can sue for wrongful termination is where there is a strong public interest in ensuring that employees are not terminated for unjust reasons, such as where an employee is terminated for revealing an employer's discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nOther than the above, being laid off and being terminated are exactly the same. There is no implied warranty that you will be rehired for the same job.\n\nSo, in order to answer your question, you would need to know if you are employed in a ""cause"" jurisdiction. If you are, you may have a case for wrongful termination. Otherwise, you probably don't.\n\nBut, if you're concerned, see an employment lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction."

"You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes. \n\nIn the instructions at Grants.gov, you have to first go to CFDA to find out the grant number that you qualify. You can search CFDA various ways (by grant number, by keyword, etc.). You can find grant programs by category -- here are the lists of grants under Home Buying/Homeownership http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.FIND_GRANT_PROGRAM_TXT.SHOW?p_arg_names=func_cat_cd&p_arg_values=ML  Check if any applies to you\n\nTo make searching easier, Housing and Urban Development HUD has a list of housing grants http://www.hud.gov/offices/adm/grants/fundsavail.cfm - though I have NOT seen any grants available for first time homeowners.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\n\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"
Businesses must register with the Secretary of State in your state.  At that time you will have a legally registered company (LLC or Corp, etc).  You can do this yourself, or use an attorney.  In this case you might call the entity ABC Enterprises, LLC.  If you want to conduct business using other names, you must file an assumed name (or D.B.A. doing Business as).  This is sometimes regulated by the state, but usually the county you live in.  Call you county clerks office to check on this.\n\nYou could then have several assumed names doing different things, all under the umberall of ABC Enterprises, LLC\n\nABC Shipping\nABC Shopping\nABC Whatever\n\nThis would save you money, as DBA filings are cheap vs LLC filings expensive.

Who are we that we can toss pennies away- giive to someone who needs it!\n\nanother tidbit of info for you:\n\nFrom the following website: WWW.TREASURY.GOV--\n\nAre there any plans to remove the one-cent coin (more popularly known as the ""penny”) from circulation?\n\n You may be interested to know that the penny is the most widely used denomination currently in circulation and it remains profitable to make. Significantly, it is Congress that determines the denominations of coins that the Mint must produce and put into circulation. Each penny costs .81 of a cent to make, but the United States Mint collects one cent for it. The profit goes to help fund the operation of the United States Mint and to help pay the public debt. In 2000, this profit added up to about $24 million. As the United States Mint produces the coins that Congress mandates, it does not have the authority to abolish a unit of currency. If directed to do so by legislation enacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the Treasury Department would again study phasing out the penny. Because the demand exists and the Federal Reserve Banks require inventories to meet the demand, the United States Mint is committed to producing the penny."

This site has the answer.
Bonus shares are shares given to existing shareholders usually based on a particular ratio. The shareholders need not pay for such shares. The company will decrease their distributable reserves and increase their paid up capital.\nTo the shareholders, receiving bonus shares represents a return on their investment. But unlike dividends, bonus shares are usually tax-free. The end result is that the shareholder will now own more shares in the company.
I'm glad you asked that question. Many jobs that pay 15+ would have some level of skill. What are you good at? What do you like to do? Can you do landscaping on the weekends? How about building things, carpentry?\nI suspect you already have a job that may not pay quite enough.

sorry to say Cutegal, some people you can talk to and others you can't.\n\nfor some reason this person feels she need confirmation from others; than herself, there is a lack of something, she is not content with herself; if she is going to trade her personal information for friendship that is a red flag, not only that if she trade her own info, she will trade yours!!! so stay away.\n\nIf she can't take your advice and realize that she have more enemies than friends and that you are actually taking a chance for her, by doing a good deed at work by warning her than she has a problem. she is setting her self up for maddness. I learned you can't talk to certain people about certain things. You have to be aware of the person minds state and be able to perdict, how they would handle it or take it. this person did not find herself yet; she is not comfortable in her skin (not good) obvisiously she didn't learn he lesson, yet. she will get a wake up call , I just hope it doesn't cost anything.\n\nbut this was a lesson for you also, look at it in a positive way, you have just collected another piece of knowlage to add to the wisdom of life.
I think your question answers itself. People no longer list that information as a rule because of the high mobility rates of our current workforce. Further, in most companies, even if a supervisor is listed, you're never going to get past the HR department when you call.

FHA stands for Federal Housing Administration. If you are talking about an FHA loan it is a mortgage that has a guarantee by the government that if you default the bank will still get it's money from the governmenr. this allows a person to put down less of a downpayment (3% compared to 20% normal) with little to no credit. this also has provisions that allow the seller to pay all closing costs and using a gift program even pay the Downpayment for the buyer. if you need more info, Email me.

Yes, but I would suggest using the same bank. The reason: Let's say you want to transfer some money from one account to another, if your money is in two different banks, you either have to write a check from one to the other, or take out cash. Both can be a pain if it is a large amount. With both accounts in the same bank, you can easily transfer your money online, and usually without a fee. Hope this helps your friend.

A round robin letter is one where nobody is on the top or the bottom (the names usually form a circle) meaning the letter came from a group with noone organizing it.  Subsequently, a meeting would be one called by a round robin letter with noone being the Chair and Management could not blame any one individual for calling it.
It means that you have enough financial reserves to cover even the largest financial catastrophe, so you continue to put money into your own savings instead of make payments to an insurance company, that you never get back.
"Actually, you can create a pro-forma ""budget"" or ""cashflow"". A budget simply means a schedule of costs, it does not necessarily mean ""cash"". Cashflow is specific - it only deals with cash expenses, for example you would have a depreciation schedule (non-cash) on budget, but not on cashflow. You might have pre-paid expenses on your budget but not on your cashflow. A budget tells you when things happen, either cash or accrual. Cashflow is only about cash, literally."

Lower costs due at closing - that's about it.\n\nIf you have any money to put down, even as little as 2.25%, you can probably find a better deal.\n\nAsk lenders about first time home buyer programs if this is your first home.  Feel free to call as many lenders as you can to ask questions.  Do not release your social security number until you feel comfortable.  It is not necessary for a lender to pull your credit to give you information.
It depends on what the circumstances are.  If the person has a long term illness and this is documented, than no autopsy is performed.  If they find someone dead in their home and there is no history of illness, they will generally do one to rule out foul play.
Depends where you are.  IE an electrician in Atlanta, GA will make a much better living than in Bismarck, AR.  If an electrician has the proper trade certificates then they can make more money, especially if they are the proprietor of their company.

Law degrees in the U.S. are offered as a graduate program and known as Juris Doctorate (J.D.)

"Service excellence is providing your customers or clients with that ""wow"" experience instead of just giving them what you can.  Mediocrity is not a way to grow or maintain a business.  Have raving fans instead of just customers."
"""If you build it, they will come"" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.\n\nI am not sure where you got the ""$22,000"" A DAY figure for Google Adwords. I only spend $20 a day on Adwords, and it is just fine with them. I suggest you read the mechanics of Adwords -- or try it out yourself -- so you can see that you can advertise with Adwords even for just $10/day. \n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\n6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article ""10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm for tips on how to improve your conversion rates.\n\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/guide/cases/ii-lexi.htm"
The most important meaning of costing a project is to specify the value of the following factors involved with that project;\n1- Time spent to finish it = money \n2- Material used for the project = money\n3- Price of the idea if new = money\n4- Labour, if workmanship is needed = money\n5- Marketing Campaign to sell that project = money\n6- Profits to be added to all above = money\n\nThe sum of all is the Project Cost. Knowing all those factors means you are on top of your project armed with knowledge.

There are 2 types of title reports. First there is the preliminary title report which gives you general info regarding title and property type.

"I just did this in Oregon and California.  First you have to prepare your Federal return.  You can file for free at TurboTax if you earned less than $50K.

Some states will let you file for free, but TurboTax charges $19.95 to prepare each return.  You can also visit each states website by doing a google search for ""california taxes"", etc..."

"Do you mean that people that scan through your purchases at the cash register?  If so then the term is cashier and you definately won't make enough money to support you and your three kids as the job usually only pays minimum wage.  If you want to become one then bring your resume to the store and ask to speak to the manager.\n\nOr do you mean the people that appear to be counting the items then scanning them etc?  If that is it then the term would probably be ""inventory specialist"" or ""auditor"", although the term may vary from company to company.  You may want to check into the business below to see if they are hiring in your area.  I'm pretty sure the auditors only work part-time though, just so as you know."

no, not in Canada... as long as you do not owe.  However if you do end up owing they charge you interest on the amount you owe.  The interest rate was increased this year as well.  I suggest doing them as soon as possible.
"First I will address the last section of your question ""Is it with payment terms?"". A ""Loan"" is a sum of money which somebody provides with the understanding it will be paid back. That is what ""Loan"" means. If it were a ""gift"" then it is not expected to be returned or payed back. \n\nAny loan you receice is going to have payment terms. I think you actually meant repayment terms. First off it needs to be a legal document. If you sign for a loan, which is a signature, then you are agreeing to pay it back. The loan could be written on a napkin and it would be legal if you signed it. Anybody who is in the business of giving loans to people is expecting to make money on that loan. Otherwise why would they loan money to people they do not know or be in business to do so? So, expect to not only pay the amount back you actually received which is called the ""Principle amount"", expect to pay back an additional amount above what you actually received. This is called ""Interest amount"", or the amount the lender charges you for them lending it to you. This is the income they receive on the loan. This is where they make their money.\n\nNow, there are vastly differant interest ""rates"" which is the percentage of the amount you borrowed you will agree to pay in interest for the loan. If you have excellent credit the interest rate could be very low, but don't expect one much lower than 12% on a pesonal loan which does not have collateral. Collateral is something of value you own that you use as a method of the lender getting their money back if you do not pay off the loan. If you stop making payments or never make a payment, they will take the item you placed for collateral for the loan. \n\nHowever, you are not seeking a loan which requires collateral. Which by the way is how the vast majority of loans are. This ""signature loan"" you are asking about is most commomly referred as a ""personal loan"" without collateral. That pushes up the interest rate as well. When you don't have collateral, that makes it a higher risk loan and therfor is assessed a higher interest rate. \n\nThere are lenders who are not much higher than loan sharks. Loan sharks are those who give loans to those who despertly need money yet are inelligable for a bank loan or from a lending institution. They charge very high interest rates and can become very ugly if you are late on a payment even once. Be really carefull who you accept a loan from. This really can be very dangerous. Yes there are laws, but you watch the news, there are many violent criminals out in society.\n\nI hope this helps in some way. I really suggest having a wedding within whatever means you currently have and not taking a loan. Especially if you have to resort to a ""signature loan"" as these are the most likely to be provided by some less than steller members of society. I reassure you there is nothing wrong having a small and inexpensive wedding. I have the means to go with a more lavish wedding but am choosing a much less expensive one. I would rather put that money towards something else than waste it on a one day event, no matter how special. I am not cheap, just practical. \n\nI really do encourage you not to take out a loan in order to have a more expensive wedding than is affordable for you and your fiancee, and/or family budgets. While I most certainly agree a wedding is a special even which should happen once a lifetime, it is silly and irresponsible to go into debt to marry. You are beginning a life with this person and probably plan on starting a family. Why would you want to burden the start of your marriage with debt?\n\nGood luck and much happiness alway in life and your marriage."

I'm not a senior, but I helped my mother find a place. We went looking because we wanted a place where they would check on my mother every day to make sure she is okay. One thing she wanted is a nice entrance with the feel of a nice hotel. She rejected any place that was small and crowded when you walked in. She liked the places with a concierge desk and marble floors when you came in. She wanted a decent size 2 bedroom 2 bath apt so she could have family sleep over. The food was very important. We rejected a place that only had hot breakfast three days a week and tested the food every place we went. She wanted a selection of food at every meal. She wanted lots of staff to help her by parking her car and bringing in her groceries. I wanted a place with a van service for when she had to stop driving and a pool and exercise facilities, although she has not used them. We also looked at the activities. She liked bingo and movies-they have something every night. A lot of her friends liked the bridge and poker games. She liked that they have a nursing facility on the grounds so she can stay there. She liked the attractive dining room like a nice restaurant with a view of the intercoastal. I suggest that you look at where she ended up which is Harbour's Edge in Delray. It has no trouble filling up although it is very high end. I am almost 58 years old and I would like a place like Harbour's Edge in 20 years. By the way, her friends have come to dinner there and have been so impressed that some of them have also purchased units there.

"You can start by reading the article ""Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business"" at http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm . The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4. Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\nFor detailed information I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business"

No you don't have to pay through out the year.  You can pay when you file by 2007, but be aware if you don't have all the money to pay by April 15, penalty and fines will still accumulate even if you file an extension. So be ready to PAY! And yes it will hurt. So don't be surprised. That's why a lot of people have the maximum taken out so they don't owe.

It's similar to all normal commerce, but the reason nobody makes any money is that after a few levels, there are so many middlemen marking it up that there is no more room to price it much higher and actually sell it.  That's why they tell you to sell to friends and family, because they are more sympathetic and are willing to pay more to be nice.\n\nPonzi as I understand it just involves sending money to people, and then getting other people to send money to you AND the people above you for a few levels, and then those people get even more people to send money to them and you, etc.  There is no actual commerce involved, and it is mathematically guaranteed to fail after some number of levels.\n\n""Pyramid scheme"" is usually used synonymously with the Ponzi scheme, and they are all illegal except for the Federal Reserve and Social Security systems."

i'm not exactly sure what your question is, but i think it means if you're new to 3d how do you get a job when companies only ask for people with experience. well the best way is to just get your demo reel looking awesome. put heaps of errort into it. then i would honestly just approach companies. most companies do not advertise for Junior positions. just knock on their door, get them to look at your demo reel. even if they are not hiring right there and then they will keep your demo reel on file if its good. if they dont have any work they may tell you how you can improve your demo reel, they may also know of another place that is hiring juniors.\n\nso by best piece of advise is work on ya demo reel and then just show up on the door step of the companies you want to work for. BE PREPAIRED do some research on the company before you go there. like what they recenetly finished, what they are working on right now. these can be found on the company's website\n\nhope this helps\n\neagle4

Yes, a prepayment penalty is deductible.  It's essentially a payment in lieu of the interest the lender would have earned had you not prepaid.  It's deductible as interest.\n\nFrom the IRS website (pub. 936):\n\nMortgage prepayment penalty.   If you pay off your home mortgage early, you may have to pay a penalty. You can deduct that penalty as home mortgage interest provided the penalty is not for a specific service performed or cost incurred in connection with your mortgage loan.

Illinois has a state bond program that will allow a first time home buyer finance the closing costs and allow 100% financing. Their interest rates are normally below market allowing more favorable payments. However since this program is state sponsored, you would be required to provide a lot of documentation to determine your eligibility. Look on the state website and find information about it under the housing section. Hope this helps, contact me directly if you have any questions.

I am a recent graduate/ accountant. I love the work, my firm, and the industry in general. If you love what you do in the classroom, you will most likely love the work outside of the classroom. Generally, in your first few years, you will not be responsible for dealing with and solving problems. The partners of your firm will deal with those. In private accounting, your supervisors will deal with problems, etc. Once you've been working for a couple years, then you will be faced with situations that you will be making decisions on. Good luck!!!

Yes. However, the amount of tax depends on which country that you comes from (some countries may have tax treaty), the purpose of the financial aid (e.g., the tuitions is tax deductible, living expense is not tax deductible). You should check with school’s international student office. They should offer help. H&R is not going to help much.
"Not only can they sue -- they will sue. And when (not if) they win, they will garnish your wages for the original bill plus hefty late fees and interest (usually done by the collection agency they turn your bill over to). I have several people working for me who are having their wages garnished now for medical bills. Best get on, and stick to, a payment plan now. These bill do not just go away. \n\nDon't be fooled into thinking that a ""non-profit"" hospital is a ""charity."" The two words are not synonyms. This mentality is just one of the many causes of the rise in healthcare costs. Hospitals spend millions trying to collect unpaid bills.

As a spouse, child or other relative of a deceased person you have a choice of whether to inherit or decline to inherit the estate of the person. This applies to the sum total of their assets and liabilities. Therefore you are not liable for any unpaid bills as long as you're not trying to inherit any possessions either. You do become liable for any left over debts if you also seek to inherit the assets.

As long as there is no stipulation that the card is non-transferrable, you can try to sell it on ebay.  My guess is that you won't get anywhere near the cash value of it because it's insanely rare that anyone gets gift certificates for that large an amount especially on groceries. You will then be further limited to hoping to find a buyer among the people who have access to that particular grocery store or chain.\n\nThere are also a few websites where you can sell gift cards or exchange them for gift cards to other stores and although they were discussed in the news for a while, a great number of people still don't know they exist so again, you'd be hoping for a buyer from a small scross section of people.\n\nWith a certificate that large, in my opinion, the only way you can get the best value out of it is to just use it yourself over time until it runs out.
Are you looking to read PARAGRAPHS or are you really naive enough to believe this could be answered in a couple of short sentences?
The fourth answer is the correct answer. A company can not declare profit on their own stocks, even if they buy back at 5 and sell it at $50, not $1 of it will be in income, just additional capital and higher owner's equity. The company itself has no good reason to declare a dividend or a buyback, it helps the share holders only. With less shares outstanding Earnings per share goes up, and that way the company price goes up. It's a way to increase the share price of the company despite no growth, or little growth. Most big companies who have slow growth, but high cash flow make up their slow growth by dividends and buy backs.

"It is hard to find grants to start a business or for home repairs for a for-profit business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

i wonder why you chose himachal pradesh or utranchal. I think a more better option would be in states like Maharastra or Gujrat. If you take my suggestion, I think the area around Vishakapatnam would be great. It is close to Orissa where you can find the steel. The people of Vizag are industrious and the govt is eager to promote industry which is great advantage. If you are looking for a safe option, then Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu is the spot to put up yoour company for obvious reasons.\n\nIn my book, bihar or WB are much better options when compared to your mentioned states.

She'd spill her food on purpose and spit at me sometimes.\n\nI could read while she slept, but after a while that gets boring also and your eyes start to get sore. \n\nShe was really wealthy and lived in a nursing home, so I didn't have to change her diapers- but I was so bored that I would offer to take out the trash and do little things- just for something to do!\n\nFor $6.50 an hour, it was hell.

It helps if you understand people and work well with  them. You need to be knowledgeable of the business in which you're leading. You need skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, delegation, planning, coaching, communication, time management, discipline. You need character strength, because leadership is one of the hardest things you'll have to do. You need to be good at directing, motivating, developing and empowering people. \n\nA lot of stuff, huh? Hey, that's why they pay 'em the big bucks.
First off, your brother will have to pre-qualify for the refinance without you. \nSecondly, there are no proceeds unless you do a cash-out and a cash-out is equity. \nIf equity is cashed out it is added to the org loan amt + refi fees. \nWhich in turn, would leave your brother with a higher loan amt and a slightly higher pmt but would allow you to walk with your money to invest.
Without prenups in place, yes, it is.
This question can't be answered without knowing what you'll need the money for, and your time horizon for needing it. If it's for retirement, or college education, or that second home, and we have a time horizon of 10 years or more, then ABSOLUTELY is MSFT a good buy right now.  It's a great company that's an industry leader, operates globally, and keeps increasing its dividend.  It's EXACTLY the sort of company you'd want to own. True, it's not as low as it's ever been, but timing the market is proven to not be anywhere near as important as TIME IN the market in the vast majority of cases.  \n\nIf, however, this is more of a short-term investment, then of course price becomes much more important.  Other tech plays that are more attractively valued at the current exact time are INTC and DELL.  Both are way off their 52-week highs.  \n\nEither way, keep in mind, lots of huge Value funds hold Microsoft right now, so the big money people think it's a good buy.  We can learn a lesson from that.\n\nAlso please keep in mind, that MSFT Being down over 3 points just TODAY(4/28/06) creats an incredible buying opportunity, especially if you're going to keep owning it for a while.\n\nGood luck, and try to avoid short term trading.  In enarly every case, it leads to ruin!\n\n--J

It depends on a lot of factors, most important of which is the establishment. In more expensive restaurants, where the prices of food are higher, tips will be greater although there may be lower turnover of tables. And good servers make more money that poor servers.

NO.  You need to realize when you finance a car, the finance company in essence owns the car.  That is why they have the title to it and you don't.  What you need to do is as soon as possible call them and explain the situation.  Most companies will work out something with you to help out for a few months while you look for new income.\nThe only other options you have is to sell the car, or allow the bank to repossess it.  Repossession is the last resort because it destroys your credit and the bank doesn't want the hassle of auctioning the car at a loss.

To do this, you can take their market cap and divide by the price.\n\nFor WMT, this is 191.61B / 45.98 = 4.17 billion shares.\nSE/shares = 53.171 / 4.17 = 12.76 book value per share.\n\nPrice to book will be price divided by book value per share.\n45.98 / 12.76 = 3.60, which is close enough.\n\nP/E is just the price divided by the earnings per share (EPS).\n\nTheir EPS was 2.68.\n45.98 / 2.68 = 17.2 P/E\n\nSome of that info is on the main quote page: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=WMT

Hello gleason1010,\n\nI have tested the Life Empowered System along with some other similar ebook guides.  Yes, I can recommend purchasing the Life Empowered System.  It's 100% legitimate and gives extremely high quality step-by-step on making money online, how to promote an existing online business, and tons more.  Out of all the How-To ebooks on making money or marketing that I've tested, and that's alot!, this is by far the best you'll ever find.  And heck, the price is so reasonable!

Perhaps you need to have a few people take a look at your resume to give you some feedback. I would also do some mock interviews and see what professionals think about your interviews skills. The best place to find these resources are at a college, specifically technical colleges want you to succeed so they offer these services to you. Another way to practice is go to job fairs, and have different employers take a look at your resume. Hopefully you will be able to figure out if there is something that might be turning employers away so that you can correct it.
Sure if you're good at checking out people and business in other countries and good at writing contracts, and know what you're doing.\n\nOtherwise you have a lot of money to pay attorney's to be responsible for all of that and check references and make sure everything is legitimate, legal, and up front.\n\nSurely you're not talking about blindly handing over some money are you? Or doing business with someone you haven't checked out first? Do you know what the laws are of that country, or how they are different from ours, or if our laws apply there? What is your recourse if they skip?
"Thanks for asking! I am a business librarian, so I will consult Hoovers Business Database to find your answer:\n\nPan American Airways represents the latest effort to keep the storied ""Pan Am"" name aloft. The company was formed in 1998 when New England railroad operator Guilford Transportation Industries bought bankrupt Pan American World Airways. That air carrier had acquired the rights to the name of the original Pan Am, which folded in 1991.\n\nThese days Pan American Airways offers service under the Pan Am Clipper Connection brand in the eastern US and Puerto Rico. The carrier's flights have been operated by affiliate Boston-Maine Airways since Pan American Airways fired its unionized pilots and shut down its own flight operations in 2004."
I live in the New Orleans area.  Housing is SCARCE right now.  Many people are looking to rent, possibly short-term (12 mos. or so).  Property taxes are not that high, at least they weren't before Katrina, but then again, our streets, public service, and schools suck.\n\nIF you find any units, chances are you'll have to do some fixing up.  Need a contractor?  Get on a list and wait 3 or 4 months before they come out.  Doing it yourself?  Stand in line at Home Depot or Lowe's for an hour or so for each trip - IF they have what you want.\n\nI am not trying to discourage you - contrary to what you may think - I just want to paint a realistic picture for you.  My children's school just had their roof replaced from hurricane Katrina - in MARCH.  Times are tough... but we need people to help rebuild with us... and have lots of patience.  Good luck.

Contact your local board of relators.  They should be in the phone book or online somewhere.  They can hook you up with a relator that could talk to you about the career.

I have about $10,000 but it's in a no-interest credit card, at least for 12 months.  I'm using it to balance out an investment that will pay 15% after a year, so in the end I'll make about $1500 on the deal.\n\nWish I could do that with a million dollars -- wouldn't have to work at all.  :)\n\nAnyway I have equity in my house to cover the loan if anything should go wrong, so it's not exactly the same as what you mean.

But things were pretty scary there for a bit.
"No one can say whether you will do good on eBay until you try.\n\nAn important part of the equation for success on eBay is having products that buyers actually want.

"Yes. \n\nIf you know you have pending taxes, the best way is to contact the IRS and make the arrangements to file. You must file first.  It is required.  That way you will know better where you stand and you are beginning to be in compliance. Then you can talk about how to pay the amounts indicated by your returns.\n\nThe payback scheme is based upon the income you need to live.  This may mean such things as changing the kids to public school, one telephone in the house, eating in, etc.  In the old days this was called ""tightening your belt"".  By the way, the IRS has charts that give working numbers for living expenses according to family size and other criteria. You must document your necessary expenses.  \n\nIf you let the default go, interest will accrue and worst things begin to happen, such as a lien being filed against you(which then becomes a public record), your employer could be contacted and your paycheck could be affected.\n\nDon't give excuses unless they are legal.  “I was irresponsible and I want to rectify my mistake”, is probably more palatable. Work with the tax man and he will work with you.\n\nNo, I don't work for the IRS."

"A lapse is generated by the policy holder. A policy on vehicles, health, home, and/or insurable personal property will lapse if you do not continue to pay the bill or pay it on time. There is usually a provision for reinstatement without lapse if you pay your back and present bill. In situtations where an Underwriter has flagged your account as ""do not reinstate"" your policy will lapse unless you pay the bill on time.\n\nIf it is a life insurance policy, there are provisions generally for the policy to pay itself. It will deduct the premium from your policy until the cash value is exhausted. It will then lapse."
No.
I recommend that you check out temporary agencies, such as Manpower (www.manpower.com) to find short-term assignments in your area.  You may also be able to find temporary assignments through the major job boards, such as monster.com, dice.com and careerbuilder.com.\n\nThe advantages to taking temporary work are twofold:  Temporary assignment(s) give you the opportunity as an entry-level accountant to explore different types of jobs within your field of specialization that interest you.  \n\nAlso, temporary assignments frequently lead to permanent assignments, especially if you do a good job.\n\nGood luck.

These days, there are lots of third party recruiters who work independently on behalf of companies. There are also lots of scam artists.  Before you meet him or even send him your resume, ask him to give you a letter from the company stating that he is working on their behalf.\n\nBy the way, sometimes companies hire third party recruiters so they don't have to list the opening on their website. They may not want the world to know about the search, or even their own employees. \n\nA good third party recruiter will have their own company email address and a good phone number to their business, but many are out their on their own. Some list their phone as private so that when they call into businesses to poach, their calls can't be traced.

well i dont actually own a piggery, my stepfather does.  It operates on our farm here.  We lease it out to people who supple the pigs.  We feed them and maintain the piggery and they pay us to do so.  On some occasions the piggery does smell pretty bad due to all the waste.  However we have an anearobic dam that breaks down the waste once it leaves the piggerey.  We then pump the waste out onto the grass helps it to grow.  The only problem I have with the piggery is the smell, especially when its going to rain.
I try to go to the small mom and pop shops where available. Walmart seems to be getting crappier stuff all the time.

Thinking big numbers like 1 million in 5 years is a good start. If my math is correct it is only $200,000 thousand per year. Not bad, some people even earn that amount.\nMy goal is $125,000 in 5 years. That is $25,000 per year\nat $2,000 per month. I am a small thinker. The route to my small goal is small business ownership #1. Keep your cost of living low, #2, Stay out of debt #3. Dont waste your time working for others, or sitting wasting your life away on a meaningless job.  Plus be willing to work 7 days a week to make ends meet. If you are working, get a second job of personal business interest. Its hard work but happy work. Or ask a millionaire how to. Good Luck!

Bad items fall off after 7 years, except bankruptcies, which fall off after 10.  It is supposed to be automatic but the credit reporting agencies (CRAs) aren't as vigilant about doing this as they should be, so check your credit report and if there's something on there that shouldn't be, write a letter demanding it be removed to all 3 of the CRAs and follow that up with phone calls to each one to make sure it gets done.
1/  Traditional lenders such as banks etc. Most will have programs for small business loans.\n\n2/  Through the Small Business Administration. Find a bank that is also an SBA lender (many are so no problem with thsi) and see if you qualify under any of the SBA loan programs. \n\n3/  Equity Investors - you can get private parties to invest in your business in return for stock. This is what Venture capitalists do. Success in this type of financing depends on the industry, type of business etc. \n\n4/  Borrow money from family and friends. This is how many people start their businesses. Again, this depends on type of business. If you need to manufacture a product for sale, this may not be a good option since funds needed may be greater than is available to you.
Is this a sub-prime lender?  Sounds like it is to me.\n\nNo one is that swamped, this is a relatively simple thing to do.  Sounds to me like your current lender is Ameriquest (which recently agreed to a 200M settlement for predatory lending and CAN'T do business in the entire state of CA anymore).\n\nSub-prime lenders can be notorious about getting a payoff out, because, once they loose the loan, they aren't getting paid anymore.  Just realize, that they have nothing to benefit by releasing your mortgage; they loose.\n\nWith that in mind.  You have to stay on them and threated legal action as well as reporting them to your state's department of licensing and finance.
This is one of those things that works for some women, and some not, depending on who you are.\n\nYou could always try selling makeup (Mary Kay, Avon), Home-Interior, or Pampered Chef. I know a lot of housewives who do this and make good money off of it. Most of them you succeed in based on how much work you put into it, so its all up to you on how successful you want to be. I would suggest you check out some of their websites. These people are always looking for new faces to sell their products (its helps their company grow!).

I have recently heard about savings secured loans, which use your savings account as collateral.  It is one of the best deals around, because at the end of the loan period, you still have savings.  It works like this:  you pay a particular amount to the bank (usually a credit union), say 5% for the loan; in the meantime, you earn interest on your savings account, say 2.5%.  When you pay off the bank, your savings is freed up, and you have really only paid 2.5% interest for the loan.  The only drawback I can foresee is if you don't have any savings to begin with.

"When you buy mutual funds, you are not buying stock in just one company. A Mutual Fund takes your money and combines it with other investors money to buy bulk lots of stock. Usually the funds are divided into low risk, moderate risk and aggresive funds. The lower the risk fund the more they diversify into safer bonds and large companies. The more aggresive the fund means that you are investing in smaller companies, but the chance for greater fund growth comes with these smaller companies, as well as more risk. Look in a newspaper and find the name of some mutual funds that have the letters nl. These are ""no load"" funds, which means you don't have to pay a broker fee to invest in them. Request an information package from the fund. It is much safer than buying individual stock."

"Here are some basics:\n\nS-Corp: limits personal liability of owners to investment in the business; LLC: ditto\n\nS-Corp: avoids ""double taxation"" of ordinary corporations.  (Standard corporations pay income tax, then distribute profits to owners, who pay tax again on the income.)  S-Corps pass profits to owners, who pay tax on the income, but the corporation itself only files a return and doesn't pay income tax.  LLC: can basically decide whether to be taxed like a corporation, like a simple partnership, or like a sole proprietorship.  The default rule depends on how many owners the LLC has, but you can file a form with the IRS to tell it you want a different option.\n\nS-Corp: ownership limited in number and restricted to natural persons (not other corporations) and legal residents; LLC: ownership not limited by number or citizenship/residency status\n\nYou might find it easier to complete the paperwork for an LLC, though both are well-designed for small businesses.\n\nIf you go with an S-Corp, be sure to check with your state to see whether they require you to file for S-Corp status with them, too.  I've had clients who filed S-Corp status with the IRS but not the state, then the state turns up in a few years wanting corporate income tax because the company was not an S-Corp in the state's eyes, just a regular, income-tax owing corporation.  It is a very good idea to consult with a locally licensed attorney on this decision, though you may be able to handle the actual set-up yourself.\n\nI hope that helps.  Good luck."

If you are going to invest only 500 then definetely Scotttrade as they are the cheapest at 7 dollars a trade. They are efficient and much better than the other brokers. If you're looking for investment advice along with a broker than maybe TD Waterhouse or Schwab but if you don't need advice and will do your homework then Scottrade is the best option.
You won't be able to exchange foreign property for US property.  \n\nYou must report any gain/loss from the sale of the foreign condo.\n\nForeign real property exchanges.   Real property located in the United States and real property located outside the United States are not considered like-kind property under the like-kind exchange rules. If you exchange foreign real property for property located in the United States, your gain or loss on the exchange is recognized. Foreign real property is real property not located in a state or the District of Columbia.\n\n  This foreign real property exchange rule does not apply to the replacement of condemned real property. Foreign and U.S. real property can still be considered like-kind property under the rules for replacing condemned property to postpone reporting gain on the condemnation. See Postponement of Gain under Involuntary Conversions, earlier.

The choice to trademark is not related to a company name or DBA (Doing Business As). Trademarking is done to protect your interests and rights in a name or phrase.  If your primary brand in the market is your company name (or DBA), trademarking is a good idea.  If your main brand in the market is a product, I recommend trademarking that.\n\nYou can go on the US PTO web site and submit trademarks yourself.  There is alot of information on the USPTO website on the rules and guidelines.  It takes about 1 year or so for an application for go through (or be denied).  Once you have applied for trademark (or service mark), make sure you label all of your sales, marketing and corporate materials with SM or TM.\n\nRelated to your question might also be whether you own the Internet URL for the company or DBA.  You can have a trademark on something, but not have rights to the URL.
marketing firms think they know more than us, and so they behave accordingly.  In addition, they want to educate us (they call it informing us), but it has a negative consequence when their ego gets in the way.  That's my take. Please don't get insulted by my answers -- just another point of view.

"There is no guarantee that you can completely fix your credit report.  You can get some negative items removed.\n\nFor those items that can't be removed, you will have to try and negotiate a payment plan with the credit..but be sure to get IN WRITING an agreement that they will remove the listing from your credit report.  Once they have your money you lose all leverage with them.\n\nThe links below go into the general process of what you have to do.  Here is a quick outline of the process.\n\n-Don't even start until you understand the laws.  Read the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Reporting Act, and the Fair Debt Collections act. The link to this inforamtion is in the links below.  \n\n-Get a copy of your credit reports from http://www.annualcreditreport.com.  Go over it very carefully.  You are looking for inaccurate information such as balance, reporting dates, or what status is being reported.  You are looking for any error that will justify an investigation.  \n\nFor example, one of the favorite tricks of collection agencies is to ""bump"" up the reporting date to extend the time it stays on your report.  By law, the reporting time begins on the day you defaulted on the loan.  Sometimes a collector gets the account and does not know the default date, so he will use the date he received it, or the last transaction date.  If you can prove this date is wrong, you can get the entry removed from your credit report.\n\n-Send a letter to each of the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA) and protest the entries you believe are not accurate.  By law the CRA must ""VERIFY"" the report.  All this means is he will contact the creditor and ask if the report is correct.  There is no real ""investigation"".  If the creditor responds back that it's legit, the listing will say on your report, but you are allowed to place a comment to say you are protesting the entry.  They have 30 days to respond back to you on this.\n\n-If the CRA says it's been ""verified"", your next step is to ""VALIDATE"" the debt.  That means the creditor must prove you have a legitimate debt, and you have a legal obligation to pay it.  He MUST supply you with copies of all contracts, bills, receipts, and everything they used to calculate what they claim you owe them. \n\nTo get this, send them a letter (I have a sample letter in the links below), demanding that they VALIDATE the debt.  If they don't respond back with this information within 30 days, send a copy of the validation request, plus another letter to the CRA demanding they remove the entry due to ""lack of validation"".  The CRA will have to again investigate this report, and if the entry is still not removed you have grounds to sue both the CRA and Creditor for violation of the FCRA.  That is a simple small claims process, and you can get $1000 from each of them.  \n\n-If the credit does send you a copy of the validation information, study it carefully.  This is the information they will use in court if you bring a suit against them.  If it's pretty cut and dry, you will not be able to remove the entry.\n\nIf you have any questions contact me.\nI've helped many people do this, and I'm currently suing a creditor in small claims right now.  It can be done, it's not hard.  \n\nYou just have to understand the law!"

International financial organizations such as World Bank or UNDP do not provide technical assistance or grants to private businesses. They only provide grants to public sector and non-governmental organizations for development projects. \n\nHere's an example of the types of grants World Bank gives in the Philippines\nhttp://www.worldbank.org.ph/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/PHILIPPINESEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20209656~menuPK:333014~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:332982,00.html\n\nYour best bet is to go to a bank and ask for a loan.
You do not need to be purchasing anything unless you are able to pay for it.  Buying on credit delays the payment.  It does not eliminate it.  Save your money, a little at a time, instead.  Believe me, I've been in credit card debt before and I won't ever go there again.  It's too expensive.
"It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

That would be very tough to do indeed. If you want to do a little risk taking then you could go to a casino. One that has single zero roulette. Pick black or red, the previous number hits don't matter. Pick a color and then when the dealer has spun the ball, slap that cash on your color. The risk is that you may lose it all. If you win then you have made  your cash and walk away. You almost have a 50/50 chance of winning. The odds are slightly in the Houses favor with use of the zero. 100% risk and 100% reward.

"Actually, the $11,000 limit is the amount above which you have to report the gift to the IRS. If you give below $11,000, you don't even have to tell the IRS you did it. You can do that once each year.\n\nIf you give someone more than $11,000 in any one year, you have to report the amount to the IRS. However, the giver doesn't have to pay taxes on that amount automatically. Instead, the amount is documented and added to any future gifts reported to the IRS. Once that amount hits $1 Million, then the IRS begins taxing it. Before then, nobody gets taxed on the gifts.\n\nThat's why the hubbub over the Estate Tax is such a joke (also called by some politicians the ""Death Tax.""). How many people do you know that will have $1 Million dollars to give to their heirs when they die (including any value of a home, for example)? I don't know too many. The Estate Tax as it is now written only affects a small percentage of the richest people in the country.\n\nI hope that helps."

I have health insurance, but it costs me 50 bucks a week. Where as my boyfriend does not. He can't afford it at the job we are at, but the state says he makes to much to get free health. And to get partical, you have to pay a $1700 dectable...his bills aren't even that much. So i guess you have to be completely poor to get any health help. We had to take him to the ER and now he owes $1200. Health in this country is so unbelievable. I can't believe that they will give an immagrant free health and not help out a citizen that has been here all his life working his ass off. Friggen messed up. You can go to any other country and the health is sooo much cheaper..gah...sorry, I could go on all night :P
Don't go there.  Call your credit card company and negotiate the interest rate.  They will usually work with you and drop it way down as low as 6 percent if you are tough about it.  Then pay off as soon as possible.  Other wise you got a snow ball that will roll up bigger and bigger.  Just use the rule of 72, what you do is divide the interest rate by 72.  If it is 12 percent then 72/12 equals 6 and your debt doubles in six years.  That means you got to get the interest rate down and pay it off with a dead line.  Good luck!

Unlike the USPS, UPS actually tracks your packages- the result is that if the USPS loses a package all they can tell you is ""better luck next time"" while UPS can see where the package was before it was lost and usually the package is located.\n\nYou can also ship packages using bus lines like Greyhound, this can be pretty economical but not as convenient.  All you need to do is get your boxes to the bus station and then pick them up at the station of their destination.

Enhanced policies are usually not worth it but it depends on the property you are buying.  The older a property is and the more times it has changed hands, the greater the chance of there being a problem with the title.  The title compnay will be more than happy to explain why their enhanced policy is better than a standard policy.  If they won't then find a new title company.
I agree with swim girl. I live in Illinois, and worked in Indiana, and I was laid off. I collected from Illinois.
"A whole life insurance policy is actually two pieces in one.\nOne piece buys just the life insurance.\nBut the other piece is an investment much like any other cash investment you make.\nThis ""other piece"" is the cash value of the policy.\nOver the years the cash value will build up and can become substantial.\nSometimes it builds up so much that it can be used to pay the premiums on the policy.\n\nThe other kind of life insurance called 'term' insurance is just the first part of the policy....the pure life part.\n\nYou can probably guess which one is more expensive.\n\nWhole life costs a lot more than term life and some people prefer to just buy term and save the cash to invest themselves.  The key is how diligent you would be in actually following through on investing the savings.  If you don't want to bother with the investing part of it, buy whole life.\nIf you want more options and control then buy term and use what you would have paid above that as investment."

Every state seems to be different.. I would strongly suggest that you visit your local social security office and ask them directly. I do know that, in general, when you make so much (extra income), there is a limit at which time they start REDUCING your social sescurity disability check..... actually, not only the social security disability but just regular social security check.

Absolutely and if the bylaws allow it and the investors and board approve it, it is not a bad idea to diversify into other investments like equities or shorter term investment grade bonds. Rather than taking cash positions when a property is sold, or with profits, because the market is indeed tightening it is wise to hold on to some appreciation, even if it is under 10% than to 1031 or hold cash.\n\nRight now the strength in the housing market is in the Midwest, west and scattered in pockets across the country. Condos are weakening faster then single families and larger commerical projects are losing appeal faster than middle market ones. So yes, shake up your portfolio.
"You know as little as 80 years ago there we very few cars, no one had hydro or gas bills to pay, we burned wood to keep warm, or stuffed hay into the attic or walls. Maybe the Amish and Mennonites are right? Do we really ""need"" these things? I'd say we go back to the pioneer days, only for the fact that most of us would die trying, which may be one way to lower the population problem as well? Hmm, kill two birds with one stone as it were. Its all a scam, the U.S. owns Kuwait and Iraq, takes almost 90% of Canadas oil and natural gas, then there's Alaska and it looks like Iran is going to be next. Why was gas like only $1.20 a gallon before all this then is what I would like to know."

Your site does have pretty good info.\nFor starters:\n1]If the basic design for your page is attractive and meaningful, visitors will likely stay. this does not mean you have to use flash etc.\nYou can find various design samples on net which are simple yet attractive.\n\n2]Advertise. how??\nUse your website as email signature / when you sign in forums/ tell everyone what you do on the website...\n\n3]Search engines\nSubmit it to google/yahoo with proper keywords which make your site climb the steps of ranking. This is slow and steady but it works.\n\n4]Newsletters\nPublish newsletter and change the content every once a while. this also a reason search engine spiders are attracted as the new info has to be ranked.

"The only thing that will stop him may be his inability to get a loan.   If you are financing the loan for him, then it shouldn't be any problem at all.   \n\nFiling bankruptcy doesn't preclude you from developing credit again, but it does basically put you at the bottom of the scale when it comes to getting good interest rates and ""instant approval"" type stuff.   \n\nIn your position, if you are making the sale to him as just a normal person to person sale, and he gets the loan....the burden of the mortgage will go to him.

Truthfully, I'd hold onto it. I would then read the papers in the lost and found section every day for a week or two. If someone was looking for it, I'd contact them. IF they could tell me how much was missing and in what denominations Like four hundred in twenties, and the rest in fifties and hundreds. And this is what I found then I'd most likely return it. If no one ran an ad for it after like a month or so, I think I'd claim it as mine.
Did you search the county assessor or tax records?  You can also ask the neighbors or tenants of the other units.  This is what I do when I see a property that I want to list.  It takes some digging, but you'll find him.  Don't be shy.

In Florida, you really do not need an attorney.\n\nMost of the contracts are form contracts that are filled out by realtors then the closing is handled by the title company.  Use the FARBAR contract... it's very straight forward.  Additionally, just keep your eyes open for any addendums or additions.\n\nWith title companies handling the closings, there really isn't as much of a need for real estate attorneys.\n\nReal estate attorneys would be able to handle more sophisticated real estate issues and negotiations.  For the most part, sales are very basic.  I believe that the real estate market is better off in general without requiring attorneys for a real estate transaction.\n\nI did my fair share of sales in NYC(in which attorneys are required to create contracts and close sales), and for the most part on complicated transactions real estate attorneys are good to have.  When the attorney involved was just an 'attorney' they usually created awful messes.  Some of which cost my clients hundreds of thousands of dollars because of their incompetence with real estate law.\n\nTransactions here in FL overall are smoother without need for attorneys.  And since you are permitted by law to have direct contact with the title company and other participants in the transaction 99% of the attorney's job you can do yourself.  Basically, making sure that everyone else is doing their thing.\n\nThe last 1% that a real estate attorney might be helpful with is for document reveiw.  If you are unable to 'cough' read or unable to sign the documents yourself... then they can be useful for FL transactions.\n\nAgain, I say this because the paperwork is standardized in a very high percentage of the transactions.  If you saw something that was really out of place... then I'd seek their advice.

The offical coins... the Perth Mint\n\nhttp://www.prospectstampsandcoins.com.au/web/perth_mint/2006_coins/\n\nBut. nearly every mint around the world has produced a commemorative coin for sale in their own country.
Now now now ....No need to make a list of what she's got and doesn't and what she should not have or what she shouldn't be on.\n1) Her computer might have been a gift, or she got it dirt cheap, or her credit is good enough to finance a great PC for pennies a month.\n2) She has to be under a certain income bracket for section 8 to accept her, otherwise she wouldn't have it.She's got three children and sometimes even a working married couple may not be able to afford it all.\n3) It's not a sin to have children, and who is anyone to tell anyone to have their tubes tied, You never know, maybe one of her children might be the future President of the USA and change everything for the better.\n\n4) I have a $12,000 wedding set and if I ever went on welfare, They cannot deny me or make me sell it, simply because of the value of the rings.\n\n5)Her internet connection? C'mon, I have super fast DSL and all I pay is $14 per month.Internet isn't expensive.\n\nNow my opinion on the matter;\nHow awful that this happened to you\n\nFirstly. I feel very sorry for you.If they were just the managers, why couldn't you speak to the owner before the eviction was final?\nAlso, you could have spoken up in court and let the judge know about the situation that got you there in the first place?\nI know it's too little and too late, but what you can do is let this neighbors apartment manager know what she did to you. And you can take this neighbor to court. Show the judge her police records of theft and show the judge the debt she caused you to have with the bank etc. You can take her to small claims court and possibly recover what she stole and damages as well (like costs for looking for a new apartment+ security first and last month, utility deposits etc.\nYou can also sue the management that evicted you as well, for allowing this neighbor with her priors on the premises, which caused all of this.\n\nFind the strength to look for a place to live. Look towards apartment agencies which will look for a place for you even the section 8 office should have a list.\n\nLearn by your mistakes, never expect a debt, or even a bill to supercede your rent responsibilty.Because your gas can get cut off, your electric, your internet..and you will still have a roof over your head. Don't allow anything to come before your rent, at least you shouldn't do that.Renting is a buisiness, and managers/landlords got property mortgage and bills to pay themselves.\nYour bank should have forgiven all the loses when they were notified,all you had to do was tell them which debits you didn't authorize.\n\nTake what you will from my advice and good luck to you.
The thing is, when a stock goes ex-dividend, the share price gets adjusted by the amount of money taken out by the dividend...  The other problem is that the Dolan family is just plain scary...  Just look at the Knicks!
They are o.k. to shop in.  Don't ever work there though as you will be a slave.  If you do find yourself working there remember anything you do on your free time can get you fired. I'm talking about before and after work and on your days off.   No matter how good and loyal you are.  IF you want a job where they run your personal life, get a public job that at least pays well.
No direct on the share price, but they will have to show up on an income statement as diluted EPS, which takes into account the effect of all rights and option conversion into common stock.  Usually the rights will trade seperately, just like options.
It depends on if you want high risk with you owning everything, if this is the case go after bank loans. If you want to have little risk to yourself, then go with investors, you won't own everything, but if you put up enough capitol to own 51% of oyur company then you can make all the decisions for yourself. regardless you should incorporate, this prevents you from having to pay everything back if you're clothing line goes belly up.

depends. fixed rates often come with a prepayment penalty. would you ever reduce  your mtg by a large sum.\nbut your interest rate will never change no matter how high or low they go unless you refi. but you will still have to pay the penalty if one is with the loan\narm will have a ceiling and a floor that it cannot exceed there is a lot of uncertainty with interest rates right now,they are more user friendly if you need to refi are can sometimes be adjusted to lower payment,\nthe best one would be whay will suit you

WOW I get to be creative WOO HOO! I would have all the toys closer to the front for both cats and dogs and of course have the toys clearly marked and divided. THEN I would have an aisle with nothing but fish aquariums and fishy stuff like the tunnels and the rocks and the food. Then on the other side of the fishy shelves I would have the stuff for the reptiles the aquariums the toys and food that you would have for the reptiles. The next aisle I would have birdy cages and birdy toys and on the other side of the shelf stock the birdy food and birdy treats. OF course have your departments clearly marked with a brightly colored sign with the name of the animal that the department is for and have a nice picture of that kind of animal on the sign all different breeds. Okay now next to the birdy stuff, you have stuff for the rodents, the bunnies and the mice and gerbils and one side you have the cages and accessories and the next side you have their food. \n\nNow for the kittycats.  One side you have their pillows and beds and their accessories such as collars and the next side, you will have the food and their litterboxes and the same with the doggies and on each endcap, you should have magazines and books about each animal. NOW if you want to have stuff for barnyard animals that should be a whole separate department. You should have that in the back of the store, it should be designed like the gardening dept at places like walmart target and so on. The reason I say that is I automatically associate that with outdoors and barnyard animals as a rule are outdoor pets. There you would have the feeding tubs and so on and so forth, their food their hay. \n\nOh Yes and the inside of the store. Divide your store in two by putting a kitty and doggy treat thing in the middle where you can sell kitty and doggy cookies bulk. It looks just like our bulk food. \n\nMost pet stores consist of happy colors. Red and blue are good colors. THe blue will mellow out the red and yellow adds a happy tone to it, but you don't want to use too much red or too much yellow. You want to even everything out. \n\nThe name of your store should be: Paws and Claws Pet Supply.  IT should be called Happy Tails Pet Supply\n\nYou can advertise with those lil mail flyers to start with and offer various promos such as buy any bag of cat/dog food and get any size free or something like that. \nOffer free pet toys on the first visit\nOf course if it is not too expensive, get your own little newspaper going and put it in the Sunday papers you know liek petsmart has their own. \n\nOh Yes and the thing that people eat up is when they are allowed to take their pets shopping with them and around Christmas time Santa gets to come into the store so the pets can visit him. \n\nGunther helped me out with this.
Usually nothing happens if you are a day late on a car payment.  Most companies give you a grace period before they add a late fee or give you a 30 day blemish on your credit report.  If you go one day over the grace period both of the things I listed above will probably happen.  To be on the safe side and to get specifics call your financing company.
why do stocks drop after the x-dividend date?\n\nBecause it is money that the company is giving away so the companies value is being decrease by that much. \n\nIf a company is worth $1000 and has 10 shares of stock trading at $100/share.  If the company has a $1 divend the company will then be worth $990 and the 10 shares are now at $99/share.

I have worked for a franchisee and also a franchisor.  I now own my own company and we franchise our operation very successfully - so I'm fairly qualified to answer this one.  First you have to know that buying a franchise is not a guarantee of success.  However there are many aspects of franchised operations that will help you.  You want to ask at least the following:\n1. How long have they been franchising?\n2. What is the success rate of franchisees?\n3. Can you talk to a couple of differrent franchise owners to learn their experience and get some tips on setting up (this is not something they should have ANY problems with at all).\n4. In the case of faile d franchisees, what were the causes of failure? (Keep in mind that many businesses do ofail in start up - it's not necessarily a comment on the competence of the franchisee or franchisor).\n5. In the specific market you're in, are there any tips other franchisees would share with you.\n\nYou want to get to a position where you are talking to other franchisees as soon as you can - to see how well or otherwise they are doing.  \n\nYou don't want to be too suprised at the fees.  You have to be sure that your business can support those fees.  That comes down to accurately asssessing the business in your feasability study.  You'll also find that the franchisor can probably supply you with a business plan - as others will have needed one.  I've provided one to help each franchisee since I started.  They will put their own spin on some elements, but the basis largely the same.  Ask if he has a copy of a successful business plan.\n\nA franchise is really a type of business partnership. In fact, for me, past franchisees have subsequently become partners in the franchise companies - because they become so knowledgable baout what the business is trying to do.\n\nIt will fail, franchise or otherwise, if the market is not there - for whatever service you offer.  Do your research thouroughly.  Then startr putting numbers together to see how viable it really is.  Talk to other people in the same business in other areas and ask if they feel it might work.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.\n\nGood luck,\n\nJFS
Contact a reputable valuation company in your area and have your motel valued.\n\nThis will give you a 'current valuation' of you property, meaning that if you were to put it on the market today, it should sell for the amount stated in the valuation.
Both you and me are trying to find the answer to that one.  All I can tell you is that IRS.gov is no help either.  They have plenty of information about refunds, but only info about how to inquire about payment if it has taken an inordinate amount of time to process.  From the site:\n\nI'm concerned because my check payment to the IRS has not been cashed yet. What should I do?\n\nYou can call (800) 829-1040 and ask an IRS representative if the payment has been credited to your account. If it has not and the check has not cleared your financial institution, you may choose to place a stop-payment on the original check and send another payment.
You can definitely make more money waiting tables. I waited tables for years and its a great way to make money--but more exhausting and stressful than most people realize. Look for a casual restaurant to get a start. \n\nYou may need to start out by bussing tables but you'll be able to learn the ropes and get great experience. \nOnce you have experience waiting tables, you'll be able to get a job at a better restaurant and make more money. \n\nIts not necessarily something you want to do for life (all that time on your feet is tough), but it was incredibly helpful for me when I was in college, can be really flexible, and makes a fantastic temporary/part-time job when you need it.
Yes the government should, but if they wanted to they would have done so already. The fact of the matter is that American politicians are for sale and unless you have white envelopes stuffed with cash you problems don't really matter much. The oil companies have plenty so get ready for more to come. But dont blame people buying gas guzzling vehicles. These prices rise completely independent of American demand even though its used as a primary excuse.
The most convincing part of infomercials are all of the people who get so excited about the over exaggerated features of the product in question. Also because it looks more like a talk show than a commercial it gets us to let down our guard.
"Net worth\n\nThe Forbes 400 list of 2005 estimates that Donald Trump's net worth at $2.7 billion. This places him in 83rd place. Trump himself claims to be worth over $5 billion. However, on October 26, 2005, The New York Times published an investigation into the history of Trump's net worth which suggested that the figures stated by Forbes have regularly been several times greater than his actual worth, even though they have been much lower than Trump's own estimates. Additionally, in Wayne Barret's book, ""Trump: The Deals and the Downfalls,"" it is reported that an outside auditor reported that Trump ""seriously over-valued"" his assets. Further, in the recent book ""Trump Nation,"" author Tim O'Brien makes a convincing case that not only is Trump not worth between $2 and 5 billion, but that Donald Trump is not a billionaire at all."
Assuming you are referring to residential properties - almost any where in the suburban areas. Area real estate is a little flat but not a flat as in most parts of the country which makes this a good time to buy. I just sold some investment property in No. VA - if I were to reinvest it would be in high rise condo apartments. Hi rises give you the least maintenance/abuse exposure and have a good set of enforceable rules.

It depends on where you are If you are in an unincorporated area likely not, otherwise most likely you do., Contact the SBA (small business administration) in your area and they can walk you through the steps and give you useful tips and advice for free.
It depends on the wording of the contract submitted when you gave the deposit.  A good real estate agent would cover the basics to protect your money.
International strategy is referring to the way companies make choices about how to develop and use the resources they have available to them - internationally. They want to use all the resources they can...at the lowest cost to them, to achieve their international objective.  In short...I think international strategy is having the company 'adapt' to its surroundings to achieve its goal.

"Big Oil is rapidly coming up to speed, Jeremy.  From Treehugger.com, on April 6th:\n\n""The burgeoning biodiesel industry got a friendly boost from a somewhat unlikely source: big oil. Motiva Enterprises, a large oil company headquartered in Houston, recently announced that the Motiva Enterprises terminal in Dallas will now offer biodiesel at any blend level. Petroleum distributors who deliver biodiesel to retail outlets and other customers in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area can now load pre-blended biodiesel on their tanker trucks. This allows distributors to get more biodiesel distributed, as the deal eliminates the additional cost and inconvenience of making two stops to obtain the biodiesel and petroleum diesel, and purchasing blending equipment. Motiva, a partnership between Shell Oil Co. and Saudi Refining Inc., is among the first major oil companies to provide a blending and loading terminal for the alternative fuel; other refiners who already blend biodiesel at the terminal level include Valero Energy Corp. and Tesoro Corp. Biodiesel kingpin Willie Nelson was joined by fellow booster Morgan Freeman to announce the installation of a 30,000-gallon heated tank that will allow biodiesel to be loaded onto tanker trucks already fully blended with petroleum diesel."""

"Steve JOBS\n\nJobs worked at Apple for several years with an annual salary of $1, and this earned him a listing in Guinness World Records as the ""Lowest Paid Chief Executive Officer"". At the 2000 keynote speech of Macworld Expo in San Francisco, the company dropped the ""interim"" from his title. His current salary at Apple officially remains $1 per year, although he has traditionally been the recipient of a number of lucrative ""executive gifts"" from the board, including a $90 million jet in 1999, and just under 30 million shares of restricted stock in 2000-2002. As such, Jobs is well compensated for his efforts at Apple despite the nominal one-dollar salary."

"Behavioural based questions are a good indicator of their relevant experience, as it focuses on actual situations versus academic theoretical situations.  For example, you could ask a question like ""Tell me about a time when you did something extra to improve a patron's experience.""  or ""Tell me about a time when you did more that was required of you.""  Those who can't answer these well suggests to you that they don't have the experience or understanding to do the job well.  With such questions, you'll find the people with the right attitude as well as the people who actually know about what you are asking."

Most banking jobs are awarded internally. In fact, almost everyone that works in a bank started out as a teller, and moved their way up. I would suggest applying to banks in your area for the posisiton of a teller. \n\nMost banks do require a Bachelor's degree for a teller position, so as long as your degree is recognized in Canada, that shouldn't be a problem. Just don't expect to be shoe horned into a higher position in the bank right away. The Canadian finanacial system is quite different than that of Pakistan, so you'll basically need to relearn the game all over again. :)
You dont need a business license for an online store. However if you run a an formal store in the place you live or elsewhere you need to obtain a business license from the local govt of the area but in both cases you have to contact the IRS for tax information. The IRS have a website which you could consult for tax structure.
When you filled out the fasta form , the school gets the information for example if you are staying in the dorms etc.... What happens is that the school will send you out a letter with all the  grants/ loans/ work study etc on it. You have to send it back to the University on whether you accept  the package or accept the package with these changes  or deny it completely.  Along with this is a promissory note saying that if you take out the loans that you will pay them back. ( my daughter calls this signing your life away)  Books, living expenses, tuition fees are all part of the package. And the University gets the check first , takes out the tuition and fees and dorm fees if you are staying on campus and it sends you the rest usually right before the start of classes So you can buy books etc. Books will give you a minor stroke when you see how expensive they are. And if you get work study try to get in your department in which your major is..  My daughter learned allot of things seeing profs outside of class and it helped her network within the school of engineering. Best of luck to you.
Grocery stores. Go for grocery stores. You can get good work experience and have room to move up in places. Good luck.
The best and most overlooked way to improve classroom education of any kind is to introduce the use of boardgames. I have taught for over ten years all over the world, and only when I use boardgames do students voluntarily insist on extending their classes for two, three, even four hours.

Only banks chartered before 1932 are not required to be FDIC insured.  There are less than a dozen of them.  FDIC insuranc guarantees that you will get back up to $100,000 worth of principal in the event of bank failure and that is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  On the other hand, I cannot imagine the circumstance where Chase would fail in the next five years, so it probably does not matter.\n\nAs a note, Chase is FDIC insured for deposits and I am sure CapitalOne is too.

The purpose of the stock exchange is simple to facilitate trading of shares from sellers to buyers.  The process of putting a company stock on the stock exchange (through an IPO), that's the company raising capital by offering shares to the public.  The theory of course is that the company can then use the capital to further grow the business and become even more profitable in the future.  \n\nAs for mergers.  The idea is that two like minded companies join forces to be bigger and better at what they do.  This will generage more income.  At the same time, combining forces can save money on duplicated work.  \n\nHope this helps.
"Read the links below, these are some of my favorite sites.  \n\nTo fix your credit, you must first educate yourself on the law, so read the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nThen:\n\nGo to http://annualcreditreport.com and get your free credit report.\n\nExamine it for errors, then send a letter to the credit bureau disputing any innaccurate information.  \n\nSend a letter to each of your creditors demanding that they validate the debt.  \n\nIf you do not get a responce to the validation letter, send a copy of this letter along with another dispute letter to the credit burear demanding that the debt be removed due to ""lack of validation""."

The Authority pays the rest of the rent to the landlord for you.\n\n\nAlso, I did a search:  fresno ca rent 400  \n\nOne of the sites was craigslist.

It seems that you have found your passions in life, Most people never discover their true gifts. Now all you have to do is act on it and make a commitment and put the fear aside.

"The original purpose of an investment bank was to raise capital and advise on mergers and acquisitions and other corporate financial strategies. As banking firms have diversified, investment banks have come to fill a variety of roles (list taken from the Swiss Banking Institute):\n\n    * Underwriting and distributing new security issues\n    * Offering brokerage services to public & institutional investors\n    * Providing financial advice to corporate clients, especially on security issues, M&A deals\n    * Providing financial security research to investors and corporate customers\n    * Market-Making, in particular securities.\n\nInvestment banks have also moved into foreign exchange markets, private banking, asset management and bridge financing.\n[edit]\n\nRaising capital in the capital markets\n[edit]\n\nThe main activities and units\n\nLarge, global investment banks typically have several business units, including Investment Banking, concerned with advising public and private corporations; Research, concerned with producing reports on valuations of financial products; and Sales and Trading, concerned with buying and selling products both on behalf of the bank's clients and also for the bank itself. Banks undertake risk through Proprietary Trading, done by a special set of traders who do not interface with clients and through Principal Risk, risk undertaken by a trader after he buys or sells a product to a client and does not hedge his total exposure. Banks seek to maximize profitability for a given amount of risk on their balance sheet.\n\nAn investment bank is split into the so-called Front Office, Middle Office and Back Office. The individual activities are described below:\n\nFRONT OFFICE\n\n    * Investment Banking, is the traditional aspect of investment banks which involves helping customers raise funds in the Capital Markets and advising on mergers and acquisitions. Investment bankers prepare idea pitches that they bring to meetings with their clients, with the expectation that their effort will be rewarded with a mandate when the client is ready to undertake a transaction. Once mandated, an investment bank is responsible for preparing all materials necessary for the transaction as well as the execution of the deal, which may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger target. Other terms for the Investment Banking Division include Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) and Corporate Finance.\n\n    * Financial Markets is split into four key divisions: Sales, Trading, Research and Structuring.\n          o Sales and Trading, is often the most profitable area of an investment bank, responsible for the majority of revenue of most investment banks. In the process of market making, traders will buy and sell financial products with the goal of making an incremental amount of money on each trade. Sales is the term for the investment banks sales force, whose primary job is to call on institutional and high-net-worth investors to suggest trading ideas (on caveat emptor basis) and take orders. Sales desks then communicate their clients' orders to the appropriate trading desks, who can price and execute trades, or structure new products that fit a specific need.\n          o Research, is the division which reviews companies and writes reports about their prospects, often with ""buy"" or ""sell"" ratings. While the research division generates no revenue, its resources are used to assist traders in trading, the sales force in suggesting ideas to customers, and investment bankers by covering their clients. In recent years the relationship between investment banking and research has become highly regulated, reducing its importance to the investment bank.\n          o Structuring has been a relatively recent division as Derivatives have come into play, with highly technical and numerate employees working on creating complex structured products which"

Is a spoon better than a fork? If it is, should we do away with forks? Consequently, by doing this would we be improving the eating experience? Holy cow, consider what we're putting at 'steak' here ;)\n\nThe moral of the story is logos and slogans serve individual purposes as well as a complementary one. A logo places an image (worth a thousand words yes, but your thousand words may be quite different from mine) of what the brand stands for in our minds. And a slogan puts those thousand words into one memorable line. Together they help you understand the brand promise and reserve a place for the brand identity in your mind. \n\nSo the next time you see the Nike swoosh, consider how conveniently 'just do it' sums up everyone's unspoken 'thousand word' interpretation of it. \n\nThe comparative longevity of either entity is an issue for watercooler debates and advertising research to figure.

Here is a recent news article that explains why:\n\nThe Toledo OH-based company, which makes brakes, axles and other parts, has been in a downward spiral since it announced in autumn 2005 that it was restating earnings and lowering its profit forecast for the year because of accounting errors. In January, Dana said it lost nearly $1.3 billion in third quarter 2005 while realigning its business. \n\nThe company, which has 46,000 employees worldwide, said it filed for Chapter 11 protection so it could fix financial and operational problems. The filing, which was entered in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, does not affect its businesses in Europe, South America, Asia, Mexico, or Canada. \n\nDana supplies parts to General Motors Corp and other automakers. \n\nMichael Burns, Dana chairman and chief executive officer, said the company will move forward with its restructuring plans. \n\nThe firm that began as Spicer Mfg Co took on its current name in 1946. Dana in 1998 bought axle and brake maker Echlin Inc in what was one of the biggest mergers in the vehicle parts industry. The move increased its overall employment to 79,000 workers.

"Well, not sure if this can be applied in all situations but your question reminded me of this response I got from an email that still cracks me up:\n\nWhat to say to a telemarketer! One of the things that has always bugged me (and I'm sure it has most of you, too) is to sit down to dinner only to be interrupted by a phone call from a telemarketer. I decided, on one such occasion, to try to be as irritating to them as they were to me. The call was from AT&T, and it went something like this: \n\nMe: Hello\n\nAT&T: Hello, this is AT&T.... \n\nMe: Is this AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \n\nMe: This is AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Yes. This is AT&T.... \n\nMe: Is this AT&T?\n\nAT&T: YES! This is AT&T. May I speak to Mr. Salem please? \n\nMe: May I ask who is calling?\n\nAT&T: This is AT&T. \n\nMe: OK, hold on. \n\nAt this point, I put the phone down for a solid 5 minutes thinking that, surely, this person would have hung up the phone. I ate my salad. Much to my surprise, when I picked up the receiver, she was still waiting. \n\nMe: Hello?\n\nAT&T: Is this Mr. Salem? \n\nMe: May I ask who is calling please?\n\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \n\nMe: Is this AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Yes, this is AT&T.... \n\nMe: This is AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Yes, is this Mr. Salem? \n\nMe: Yes, is this AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \n\nMe: The phone company?\n\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \n\nMe: I thought you said this was AT&T.\n\nAT&T: Yes, sir, we are a phone company. \n\nMe: I already have a phone.\n\nAT&T: We aren't selling phones today, Mr. Salem. \n\nMe: Well, whatever it is, I'm really not interested, but thanks for calling. \n\nWhen you are not interested in something, I don't think you can express yourself any plainer than by saying ""I'm really not interested"", but this lady was persistent. \n\nAT&T: Mr. Salem, we would like to offer you 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. \n\nNow, I am sure she meant she was offering a ""rate"" of 10 cents a minute, but she at no time used the word ""rate"". I could clearly see that it was time to whip out the trusty old calculator and do a little ciphering. \n\nMe: Now, that's 10 cents a minute 24 hours a day? AT&T: (getting a little excited at this point by my interest) Yes, sir, that's right! 24 hours a day! \n\nMe: 7 days a week?\n\nAT&T: That's right. \n\nMe: 365 days a year?\n\nAT&T: Yes, sir. \n\nMe: I am definitely interested in that! Wow!! That's amazing!! AT&T: We think so! \n\nMe: That's quite a sum of money!\n\nAT&T: Yes, sir, it's amazing how it adds up. \n\nMe: OK, so will you send me checks weekly, monthly or just one big one at the end of the year for the full $52,560? If you send an annual heck, can I get a\n\ncash advance?\n\nAT&T: Excuse me? \n\nMe: You know, the 10 cents a minute.\n\nAT&T: What are you talking about? \n\nMe: You said you'd give me 10 cents a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. That comes to $144 per day, $1,008 per week and $52,560 per year. I'm just interested in knowing how you will be making payment.\n\nAT&T: Oh no, sir, I didn't mean we'd be paying you. You pay us 10 cents a minute. \n\nMe: Wait a minute here! Didn't you say you'd give me 10 cents a minute? Are you sure this is AT&T?\n\nAT&T: Well, yes, this is AT&T, sir, but.... \n\nMe: But nothing! How do you figure that by saying that you'll give me 10 cents a minute that I'll give you 10 cents a minute? Is this some kind of suliminal telemarketing scheme? I've read about things like this in the Enquirer, you know. Don't use your alien brainwashing techniques on me.\n\nAT&T: No, sir, we are offering 10 cents a minute for.... \n\nMe: THERE YOU GO AGAIN! Can I speak to a supervisor please?!? AT&T: Sir, I don't think that is necessary. \n\nMe: Sure! You say that now! What happens later? AT&T: What? \n\nMe: I insist on speaking to a supervisor!

A correction is when there is a price drop in response to a long uptrend in an asset's appreciation.

Prices in OC are increasing, but the volume of home sales is down.  In November I bought a condo that was listed for 2 days, now 3 in my complex have been on the market for over 45 days.  \n\nHowever the place I bought was listed $50,000 less then the same model listed by another agent.  By the time the bidding war was over I paid $10K more then the asking price, the other unit for sale was thrashed and sold a month after mine for $5000 less then I paid.  Best way to sell quick is to price VERY LOW, it will get the attention of all buyers looking in your area.  You dont have to accept full price offers.  If you have a good agent they will bluff any single offers.  I have no way of verifying there was ever a bidding war on my condo, just that the sellers agent says he had 3 full price offers.  My mom was my realtor, I had 20% down payment, no home to sell, no contingencies, and I worked for a loan company.  I also put a $20,000 deposit.  In all actuality I doubt a better buyer was making an offer. \n\nRates are going up and people will spend more to borrow the same amount, lowering the amount they can afford.  If a lot of renters occupy your condo complex it may prove a good time to sell.  The owners of rental properties will let investment properties go into foreclosure before they let a primary residence default.  \nAre you moving up, or relocating?  Do you owe alot or have equity in your home?  The market is stable, but I know alot of people in over thier heads.  I also know a lot of investors with huge amounts of money to snatch up any real deals.

You want to work in america and against Illegal Immigrants? Are you stupid? What do you think that the Illegal Immigrants after just to sit on their ass all day?

Does he have an interest, or a hobby?\n\nOften times, these tough questions are right under our noses?\n\nCan he teach in a college? I assume he has some degree in counseling.\n\nHas he thought of volunteering for some charity that inspires him? Many people make the switch that way.\n\nIs he not considering the good relations he has with people in and outside of his job? Has he asked people he knows about their jobs, any openings, and how he might make a change?\n\nHowever, if the salary thing is an issue, then maybe he isn't ready yet. It's just that a career change also has to involve a change of spirit and attitude. If you are going to a career you've never done before, then you will definitely be eating some humble pie.\n\nTake it from me.

Possibly yes, there are two scenarios:\n\n1) depreciation deductions are based on when the property is 'placed in service' i.e. in use in the income-producing activity. If the property isn't being used in the business until 2007, then you would start depreciating at that point.\n\n2) even if it was 'placed in service' in 2006, you would still be getting depreciation deductions in 2007

You need to be licensed in most states to be a mortgage broker.  This sounds like a scam.  Sorry, but I'd stay away from it if I were you.  Unlicensed activity can also get you heavy penalties from the state bureau of licensing if your state requires mortgage brokers to be licensed.

Boy is that a wide range you are contemplating! In the spirit of your happiness in mind, which one do you think would give you the most fulfilling life? \nIf you are wanting to stay in your hometown and make your life there then I would say cosmetology would be a good way to remain in touch with your hometown and make a decent living, but if you crave the big city and new people and new scenery, then go for the digital animation career. It would take you to a school that is big and full of new people with new ideas and lifestyes different from yours, it will open up job opportunities in cities across the nation and maybe even overseas. This is what I would think about when i made my choices and then there is the consideration of the cost of the edudcation you would need for either career. Be happy

"You do have to wait.  It is called ""wash"" rule.  Lets say you bought stock at $100 and now sell it at $50.  You just got out with $50 loss.  Because it was a two way transaction (buy/sell) you can take that loss and use it to push down your income for the year thus avoid paying more taxes.  However if you buy the stock back within 30 days, you are no longer allowed to take that loss and use it to offset your income.  REason?  Many investors have paper losses but you can't use them to offset income.  Real losses you can.  This rule was designed so the traders/investors don't ""fake"" losses by basically resetting the cost basis of the stock.\n\nRival\n\nPS.  You can buy stock within 30 days after you sell it but you waive your right to use the loss (if you selling at loss not at gain :)  ) against your ordinary income."
2 Choices:\n\n1) Open an Account with Sharebuilder.com and invest the money on Shares in either Anheuser-Busch(BUD), Walmart (WMT), Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific (CP.) or Toyota (TM) - Sharebuilder are alot cheaper than other traders because they buy the stocks for their clients in one bulk block every week and split them between the clients (instead of lots of individual $1,000+ trades with a $10 commission fee)...... because of this it also allows you to buy fractions of stocks in a company e.g. you stick $100 on stocks in a company with valued at $200/share you still get 0.5 shares in that company.\nBefore investing in stocks..... learn everything you can about them.\n\n2) Invest in some gold bullion - either in bar or coin form.

Do what you need to but honestly the amount you will spend trying to get it back could be more than the actual amount owed to you. You could have a lawyer speak with him but if you never signed a contract or anything of that nature he could say it was a gift. Just let it go. I know its alot of money but even if you win a court case, he may never pay a dime and you will be out even more money.

I would recommend speaking to the bank that carries your mortgage. They should have someone you can talk to about the options you have regarding your mortgage. What you can do with the mortgage often depends on your financial status, the amount of the loan, the term, and the rate.\n\nGood luck!
"If you have a strong stomach for $100 price fluctuations in a day (that's $10,000 on 100 shares), you can buy something like Google.\n\nBut first, what is your definition of Long-Term? If you had bought anywhere around the 2000 high in the stock market, you would still be waiting to get even after six years, and wouldn't mind waiting another seven years to make a profit if you are truly a ""long-term"" investor.\n\nThe ""Buy-and-Hold"" strategy really doesn't hold water if you consider it depends on when you ""buy."" You might go 25 years without a profit, if history is any guide. But if that is your deal, then go for it.\n\nOtherwise, you have to consider that the Dow is again approaching that all-time historical high set in Jan 2000 at 11,721. Looks like a Double Top to me, but some people say we could double that again. Logically, this is one of the scariest markets I've ever seen in two decades of watching it; just pick something that is stable, anything. Doesn't exist, does it. Anything could send this market over the edge to the great void. But hey, it might double too, who knows. \n\nFor most people, the name of the game is capital preservation. You don't invest when the market gets too risky or too frothy or is nearing a market top or an old market top, or when the market is overpriced, or unstable, and all of these things are true today. There really is a time when cash is King. That 1.5% CD is going to look pretty good when everyone else is cryin' in their beer about losses. Or the market could just go sideways to work off the excesses, but either way, you're safe if you're out. Wanna throw the dice, go to Vegas.\n\nIf you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called ""Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?"" The other is ""Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?"" They will give you plenty to think about."

according to the 2000 U S census 2.4 % of households had income of greater than $200,000. 2.2% had incomes from $150,000 to $200,000. That data is 7 years old and with inflation and the fact that the rich are always getting richer, we can probably extrapolate that it is 3.5% to 4.0%

Stock : An instrument that signifies an ownership position (called equity) in a corporation, and represents a claim on its proportional share in the corporation's assets and profits. Ownership in the company is determined by the number of shares a person owns divided by the total number of shares outstanding. For example, if a company has 1000 shares of stock outstanding and a person owns 50 of them, then he/she owns 5% of the company. Most stock also provides voting rights, which give shareholders a proportional vote in certain corporate decisions. Only a certain type of company called a corporation has stock; other types of companies such as sole proprietorships and limited partnerships do not issue stock. also called equity or equity securities or corporate stock.
Sure they're worth something - to the right person. The fact that they are 100 years old makes them worth more, but even then - generally speaking, they aren't worth a lot unless there is something unusual about them (double die).

"Valuation is done using 3 primary methods:\n\n1. Discounted Cash Flows:  The DCF method projects the future expected cash the business is expected to generate and converts those future cash flows to the present value (because cash in the future is worth less than cash in the present).  The DCF valuation in theory should represent the intrinsic value of the company.  In practice it is not always the case.\n\n2. Comparable Company Analysis: The compco looks at the price that other companies in in the industry are trading at and determines the appropriate multiple that the industry should value the target company. (P/E, EV/EBITDA) Once the appropriate multiple has been identified the targets EBITDA or Net Income are multiplied by the multiple to get the implied valuation.\n\n3. Comparable Acquisition Analysis.  The compacq looks at the price that similar acquirers paid in similar transactions to identify the proper implied trading multiple.  The multiple is then used the same as a compco multiple for valuation.\n\nThe place where the above three valuation overlap should be the valuation for the deal.  However, in real life the actual value is the price at which the buyer is willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, regardless of what the analysis says should be the ""right"" price."

Don't take it personally.  The national average is 8 months between jobs, whether a person was terminated, laid off, or left on their own.  Some things to take inventory of are:  How many resumes have you sent out or job applications that you have filled out?  And of those, how many resulted in an interview?  That is a good indicator of how effective you are.  If the ratio is 5 - 8 interviews to 20 resumes/apps. filled out, then that is good.  Just keep plugging along.  If it is lower than that, then you need to look at what you are doing.  Another thing is to exhaust all your resources.  Network with friends and family.  That is the number one way to find a job.

"Operating Margin\nA ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.\n\nCalculated by:\n\nOperating income /(divided by) netsales\n\nOperating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages, raw materials, etc. A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs, such as interest on debt.\n\nAlso known as ""operating profit margin"" or ""net profit margin"".\n \nInvestopedia Says... Operating margin gives analysts an idea of how much a company makes (before interest and taxes) on each dollar of sales. When looking at operating margin to determine the quality of a company, it is best to look at the change in operating margin over time and to compare the company's yearly or quarterly figures to those of its competitors. If a company's margin is increasing, it is earning more per dollar of sales. The higher the margin, the better.\n\nFor example, if a company has an operating margin of 12%, this means that it makes $0.12 (before interest and taxes) for every dollar of sales. Often, nonrecurring cash flows, such as cash paid out in a lawsuit settlement, are excluded from the operating margin calculation because they don't represent a company's true operating performance.\n\nOperating Margin [or Operating Profit Margin]\nThe operating margin is another measurement of management’s efficiency. It compares the quality of a company’s operations to its competitors. A business that has a higher operating margin than its industry’s average tends to have lower fixed costs and a better gross margin, which gives management more flexibility in determining prices. This pricing flexibility provides an added measure of safety during tough economic times.\n\nTo calculate the operating margin, divide operating income by the total revenue.\n\nOperating income\n----------(divided by)----------\nTotal revenue"

On the positive side, the terms can be quite attractive.  In most situations however, the average person is better off obtaining a regular old ""conforming"" mortgage loan.

One thing which may help would be to learn the difference between advise and advice. You are looking for advice. It wouldn't hurt to check your printed materials for typos and grammatical errors. Especially, if you are seeking work as a commercial writer. The first things I notice, when trying to find writers for some of my projects, is spelling and grammar. If it is not up to snuff, I look elsewhere.\n\nNow for some advice. I hire writers on-line. To gain some experience while making a little money, try bidding for some of the jobs listed . You are able to then add the work you do to your portfolio.

I can answer this from the point of view of a hiring (recruitment) manager.\n\nIf I don't get back to a candidate ASAP, it either means:\n\n1. I'm extremely busy and there are too many work-related emergencies to deal with at the moment. A manager who uses this as an excuse generally is a new or poorly trained manager. Such a manager can easily become overwhelmed with a large number of tasks and can accidentally let important but not critically urgent tasks slip.\n\n2. There is another candidate that I'm interested in, and you're my back-up choice. I'm stalling for time so I can interview & get my first choice to accept the position. A manager who does this generally lacks integrity and probably won't treat his/her employees with much respect.\n\n3. There's a personal emergency that I suddenly had to deal with and had to leave the office. In this case, hopefully the manager has alerted his/her supervisor about his/her remaining open items and has made plans to get them covered. That doesn't always happen though, depending on the severity of the emergency.\n\n4. There's some kind of red tape that's delaying this process. Perhaps another department that is taking care of the logistics of your employment. In some large companies, HR takes care of start dates and other related issues (though that's rare). Or perhaps HR still needs to complete some tasks (like a background check, compensation issues, etc). Or perhaps the hiring manager needs his/her direct supervisor's approval before moving forward, and the bottleneck is with the supervisor. Delays due to red tape in large companies are unfortunately common.\n\nHere's what you can do in each of these situations:\n\n1. Call the hiring manager and if he/she's not there, leave a voice mail saying that you'll call back again. Make the effort yourself to keep calling until you reach him/her on the phone. You don't have to leave a message each time, but some managers dont/aren't able to respond to voice mails immediately, so getting the person on the phone directly is the best way. Also send the hiring manager a follow-up email.\n\n2. Do the same as #1. Chances are, the hiring manager will avoid returning your calls because he/she wants to keep you around as a back-up choice, and if he/she tells you about another candidate, you'll go away. But you should still get in touch with the hiring manager on the phone anyways.\n\n3. If you've been in contact with an HR representative or the hiring manager's direct supervisor, call that contact as well. Sometimes a third party can help get things going again.\n\n4. Do the same as #1. Ask the hiring manager if there's anything you can do to help the process. Perhaps he/she will tell you about the red tape and apologize for it; that would be good because you'd know the reason for the delay.\n\n\nI assume you've already received a written offer letter - if not, and the good news came verbally, than you really need to get this offer in writing. Without that, then there's a good chance the delay could be due to #4 and the hiring manager simply is trying to get that offer letter out to you.\n\nThere was once an actual case where it took me, my HR department, and my finance department nearly 2 weeks to get an offer letter out, due to various logistical issues & general red tape. However, in that situation, I was in constant contact with the candidate to let him know the reason for the delay.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck!

Getting an interview is one thing, getting a job offer is another. You won't impress the company if you are unwilling or unable to do your homework on them. Start by googling the company name. Read all you can about them. Then go to the interview prepared to ask intelligent questions. If everything else about you checks out - education, experience, appearance, communication skills - there's an excellent chance you will be offered the job.\n\nBest of success.

"Buying a sportscar with daddy's money has got to be every young man's dream. But Nikolay Smolensky, 23, has gone a one step further. \nThe young Russian has bought the entire iconic sportscar maker TVR from motoring legend Peter Wheeler. \n\nMr Smolensky, who is Russia's youngest millionaire, is believed to be a friend of Russian billionaire and Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich - although by comparison he is hardly well off. \n\nHis personal wealth is estimated at just $100m (£55m), just a fraction of Mr Abramovich's $14bn fortune. \n\nStill, for a businessman in his early 20s, Mr Smolensky's financial achievement is impressive - even if it does not offer a guarantee of future acumen or success. \n\nDaddy's boy \n\nSo far, Mr Smolensky does not seem to be a self-made millionaire. Rather, much of his money is reported to have come from the businesses created by his father: Russia's first private banker, the oligarch Alexander Smolensky. \n\n \nBank customers, desperate to withdraw their cash from SBS-Agro in 1998. \n\nThe elder Smolensky's first bank, Stolichny, appeared on the market in February 1991, ten months before the final collapse of the USSR. \n\nA year later, Stolichny and two other Russian banks set up the country's first debit card processing system, and started opening offices in some of Russia's most remote locations. \n\nBy 1998, Alexander Smolensky owned the country's largest private network of banking offices and a large stake in the debit card scheme, which had 1.2 million subscribers. \n\nHe had also merged his operations Agroprombank, which served the country's huge agricultural sector. Following the merger, Mr Smolensky's group - renamed SBS-Agro - gained considerable lobbying power. \n\nMany analysts say that Mr Smolensky, even though disliked by the Kremlin, was in a perfect position to influence some of the government's key ministers. \n\nUnpopularity \n\nBut then came August 1998: ""Black August"", as Russians dub it, when the banking system collapsed amid the country's worst financial meltdown. \n\nMany Russian analysts accuse Mr Smolensky of trying to cash in on a bear market for the rouble shortly before and during the 1998 crisis. Many see him as one of the behind-the-scenes actors in that year's Russian economic drama. \n\nShortly after the Kremlin announced that Russia would default on its national debt, the national currency plunged and dozens of small and medium-sized financial institutions shut their doors. \n\nMr Smolensky's banking group was among those that had collapsed. Along with other banks, it said there was no money left to return the deposits held in SBS-Agro, and no money available to save private investors from their plight. \n\nThe news bewildered many Russians, who had desperately wanted to believe that bankers were at least trying to help them. \n\nThousands of Russians have spent years trying to reclaim the money which they had deposited in SBS-Agro. \n\nIn 2002, most of these debts were repaid by other banks. Even so, if you ask an average Russian to give the name of the country's most unpopular oligarch, many would mention Alexander Smolensky. \n\nRevival \n\nMr Smolensky's banking business - now renamed OVK - has since been resuscitated and, even though he has moved to Austria, he retains some control of the company through his son Nikolay, who was until recently chairman of the OVK board. \n\nBut in July 2003 the long story of the Smolenskys' banking involvement seemed to have come to an end. \n\nOVK was sold to Vladimir Potanin, an oligarch rumoured to be very close to the Kremlin, and both Nikolay and Alexander joined the unofficial club of wealthy unemployed Russians. \n\nBy purchasing TVR, Nikolay Smolensky has now put the family back into the spotlight. \n\nSo far, the new owner of the legendary British car manufacturer has only promised to keep the company's wheels rolling. \n"
"I am a Powerseller on eBay, earning several thousands per month.\n\nBuying from garage sales and selling on eBay is fun, and good getting a few dollars here and there from ebay. Sometimes, you luck out on an item and hit big, but many times it will just be so-so (assuming you can even get the price you paid for it). In terms of fun factor, it is great. But from a business stand-point, it is not. Not sustainable.\n\nIf you want to earn serious money from eBay, you need to have a well-thought out business model. Selling on ebay is getting tougher -- just look at the number of auctions that closes without a bid. Go to the boards on ebay and you will hear even oldtimers complaining about how stiffer competition plus higher fees make it so much harder to sell on ebay.\n\nThe key success factor is: Sell products that people actually want. \n\nSelling on eBay is not as easy as some portray. In fact, go to eBay and check out the number of auctions that end without a single bid. Competition is getting tough, as more sellers go to eBay; even the big boys are joining in the eBay marketplace. Add to that the increasing listing and final value fees.\n\neBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace: \n\nItems In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sellbycategory.html  \n\nHot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/whatshot.html and select ""Hot Items by Category"" from the menu on the left. \n\neBay Pulse = ""a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay"". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. \n\nMerchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/calendar.html  to view the current Merchandising Calendar.\n\nAs for items to sell, you can:\n\n1. Buy bulk liquidation items such as those at Liquidation.com. The capitalization may be big, but the idea is to sell the items individually and profit from it.\n\n2. Find manufacturers of items you want to sell and buy discounted items from them\n\n3. Make deals with retailers in your area, and offer to buy their unwanted items for deep discounts. jayandmarie - the most successful ebay sellers - made deals with music stores where they will buy the entire inventory in the discounted bins, and then sold the items on ebay for 1-cent starting bid.\n\n4. Look for possible partners on the Web, preferably outside of the US. Import items from them and sell them on ebay. There's huge profits to gain from this approach.\n\nI suggest you read the articles on Success with Auctions http://www.powerhomebiz.com/internet/auctions.htm"
You are talking about selling an idea.  You need to convince people that you have a product or idea that they need.  There are several books geared to fine tuning sales skills. No specialized education is necessary to become a salesperson, you just have to believe in what your selling.  Communications courses may be helpful.

"The Roth 401K is a new retirement savings plan. It is authorized by Congress under the Internal Revenue Code, section 402A [[1]]. It represents a unique combination of the Roth IRA and a traditional 401K plan. As of January 1, 2006 US employers have been free to establish Roth 401k accounts for their employees.\n\nIn a traditional 401K plan, employees make ""elective deferrals"" and contribute earnings to their retirement plan, pre-tax. That is, an employee's elective deferral funds are set aside by the employer in a special account and the funds are invested. Typically, employers also add funds to the account by contributing matching funds on a fractional formula basis. E.g., matching funds might be added at the rate of 50% of employees' elective deferrals. Both the elective deferrals and the matching funds are invested and grow on a tax deferred basis. The invested funds are taxable at ordinary income tax rates when an account owner takes ""qualified distributions"", typically after having reached the age of 59.5.\n\nUnder a traditional Roth plan, first enacted in 1996, individuals, whether employees or self-employed, may contribute post-tax funds to an individual retirement account (IRA). The Roth IRA effectively reverses the order of the 401k and allows for post-tax contributions, but tax free growth and qualified distributions, if the contributions have been invested for at least 5 years. Contributions to a Roth IRA are significantly more limiited than those to a 401k. For 2006, individuals are limited to contributing no more than $4,000 if under age 50 and $5,000 if age 50 or older. Additionally, when taxpayers earn a Modified Adjusted Gross Income of more than $110,000, ($160,000 for married filing jointly) Roth IRA contributions are prohibited.\n\nThe Roth 401k combines some of the best aspects of both the 401k and the Roth IRA. Under the Roth 401k, employees can now decide to contribute funds on a post-tax elective deferral basis, in addition to or instead of pre-tax elective deferrals under their traditional 401K plans. An employee's combined elective deferrals, whether a mixture of traditional 401k and Roth 401k deferrals, or simply one or the other-- cannot exceed $15,000 for tax year 2006 if a participant is under 50, if they are over 50, they may do an additional $5,000 catch up contribution in 2006. Employer's matching funds are counted separately from the total $15,000 elective deferral cap.\n\nThe basic difference between a Roth 401(k) and a traditional 401(k) is that the Roth version is funded with after-tax dollars while the traditional 401(k) is funded with pre-tax dollars. In general, the earnings on your Roth contributions will be tax free as long as the distribution is made 5 years after the first Roth contribution.\n\n\nThe best advantages of the Roth 401k will be realized by those who otherwise might choose a Roth IRA. The Roth 401k offers the tax free distribution advantage of the Roth IRA, but does not have any income limits for the account holder. Additionally, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $4,000; whereas, up to $15,000 could be contributed to a Roth 401k account, provided no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year (no traditional 401k deferrals taken).\n\n\n\n\nThere are additional caveats to consider:\n\nContributions are irrevocable. Once the money goes into a Roth 401K account, it can't be switched over to a regular 401K. \nEmployees can roll over their Roth 401K contributions to a Roth IRA when they retire or if terminated. \nIt is up to the employers to provide the Roth 401K in addition to the regular 401K and many may decide not to do so because of the added administrative burden."

First of all get a copy of the return, you can do this by filing a form with the IRS? Next write them a letter and camly explain the situation. They are human and make mistakes also find out if they entered a number wrong.

If one party on a joint loan or credit card files for bankruptcy, they can be released from the debt, but any others on the loan will still be liable for repayment. Your credit rating is based on your repayment history. If an account it not included in a bankruptcy, all parties are still liable. A joint credit account may be closed to new purchases, but as long as the payments are made in a timely fashion, it will not effect your credit!

The production of gelatin starts with the boiling of bones, skins, and hides of cows and pigs, a process that releases the protein-rich collagen from animal tissues. The collagen is boiled and filtered numerous times, dried, and ground to a powder. Because the collagen is processed extensively, the final product is not categorized as a meat or animal product by the federal government. Very strict vegetarians avoid gelatin entirely, but more permissive vegetarians have no problem including JELL-O in their diets.\n\nJELL-O products account for about 80 percent of the gelatin market.\n\nPopular belief has it that gelatin comes from horses' and cows' hooves. Kraft, the maker of JELL-O, asserts that hooves do not contain the necessary collagen and therefore are not used in the production of their JELL-O brand gelatin product.

There are several things you can do. Call each credit card company (the # is found on the back of the card).  Tell them your problem and let them know you want to pay them back, that you want to continue to have good credit with them. They may give you a break but will charge your account more Finance Charges to get you through this hard time.  As for your other expenses, such as your electric bill or your phone bill, call and see what arrangements you can make with them (they may let you pay in installments).  I hope these suggestions are helpful.\n\nFor the long term, if you can't pay for something right now with cash, then you can't afford to buy it. Credit Cards are a convenience and should be used that way.  That's how you got into big debt, by buying things you can't afford.  I know, it's a bitter pill to swallow but learning these things will help you along the way.\n\nMore suggestions: Get a second job to tide you over this rough spell. On repaying your credit card debt, always pay more than minimum. On paying your regular bills, pay them when you get the bill (do not save it until it's due) because it is due now.  You can wait and forget about it until it's late and then you will be charged a Late Charge.  \n\nNormally, you don't solve money problems with more money.  You learn how to set up a budget for yourself.  You can do it simply.  Income VS Expenses.  You will see just how much you need to bring home to cover these expenses.  It's that easy.
My best advice on this one would be to start with the phone book - check to see who is handling buildings in the area.

Yes they can BUT only if it is considered suitable for the age of the students, not offensive to ethnic/religious/ gender (ect.) issues as approved by the school, and safe.  If you have questions about something - like how will other react to it...it's best to consult another teacher or administrator at your school...since they would know the regs and general attitudes of the community.  IF you are using something to demonstrate that may be offensive - inform the parents before hand, and the school admin so that anyone who doesn't wish to participate can be excused; also apologize to the class at the start of the demonstration and explain why you are using this and that you aware that it might be offensive.\n\n~What I'd like to know is what you want to put up...generally for run of the mill decorations there is no set limits that say you can or can't put something up unless it's dangerous to student.

The best advice is to pay off as many debtors away as possible and deal with as few of the remaining ones as possible.  So if you own 100$ to 10 people, and 400$ to 2 people, pay off the smaller 100$ loans.  Then negotiate with the big lenders and give them a stake in your business and try to see who can be your partner.  Try to expand your business partners to people who you trust, and don't go to the bank as they will eat you alive with the interest rates that are common place in Africa 20-30%.  Seek out venture capital, make a business plan to investors and see if they can take 20% minority stake in your company.  Keep good accounts to show that you are serious with your business transparency to outside investors... \n\nThese are just some tips, again the litte information you give it's hard to help.

"I don't think Oregon Real Estate laes cover prepayment penalties on mortgages. The investor that make the morgage determines the penalty.\n\nWhy do you have a pre-payment penalty on your mortgage? Normally prepayments are for 2 or 3 years and prehaps 5 years in some instances.\n\nBefore the loan closes some lenders offer to allow you to buy the prepay out or take a yearor two off it.\n\nNow let's answer your question, most lenders have no way of you getting out of the prepay,because you signed a contract with this in the contract.\n\nOne way to get out of most prepays is to sell the property the prepay is waived if you have what is normally called a soft prepay. \n\nIf you refinance you are accessed a hard prepay and you must come to grips with the fact that this must and will be paid.  There is no hardship waiver in any mortgage contract that I know of.\n\nYour best bet if here is any action to be taken on your behalf is to call you lender and see if there is anything they can do.

"I am a Florida landlord-tenant attorney.  The disposition of your security deposit will be determined according to the terms of your original written lease.  The Landlord-tenant statute, F.S. 83 does not provide for late fees and does not grant a ""grace period.""\n\nThe good news is that the statute is very specific on how a claim against a security deposit must be made (section 83.49(3)).  In order to impose a claim against your security deposit the landlord must send you a written claim by certified mail within 30 days of the end of the lease,  or the right to make any claim at all is forfeited.  \n\nIf the claim is property made be certified mail,  you must object within 15 days.  Then you can sue the landlord in small claims court.  The party that looses the case has to pay for both side's attorney fees.\n\nNow that your lease is up, you are a ""tenant at sufferance"" and technically liable for double rent until you sign a new lease or the landlord accepts a rental payment.\n\nSigning the new lease without a security deposit on it does not affect your rights to your old deposit.  Since you are not under a lease at the moment you may move with no penalty.  Just be sure to give the landlord your forwarding address, because if she doesn't know where you moved, she can send her claim against your deposit to your old rental unit.\n\nFeel free to contact me through my website for more information."

Companies dont offer retirement packages much anymore but employers are willing to match your contributions to 401k up to a dollar for every dollar you put in. However, rememeber if you dont get a retirement pkg. with benefits you will have purchase them yourself..... thats REALLY expensive. \nGood money from home.........do contract work, start a business, try to spin something off of what you already know. You will be more successful if you are doing something you love and are good at... so whats that?!?\nGood luck

Even if the business owner has a license to operate, that does not mean that the owner has gotten a zoning approval to run his business from home and park his limos on the street.\n\nZoning board typically takes a blind eye on home businesses -- UNTIL a neighbor complains. When a resident in the neighborhood complains of the traffic, inconveniences, too much comings-and-goings of vehicle  in a RESIDENTIAL neighborhood, the business owner will be asked (and in many cases, sued) by the county to stop operating the business in the community.\n\nI suggest you go to your county office zoning board. Check how your area is zoned, and if it is residential, then ask the procedure for filing a complaint. If the City/county officials find the business owner to be in violation of subdivision ordinances covering the amount of space required, and neighbors have complained about parking and traffic problems - they can close the business.\n\nNeighbors' complaints are always the litmus test in zoning. You can make it really difficult for them to operate their business, and I think you've got a good basis with their type of business.  \n\nHence, it is strongly recommended that home business entrepeneurs first check the zoning laws in the area to determine if the business is compliant. And be very nice to the neighbors! Otherwise, you can see your entire business hampered, if not closed, if zoning regulators get to you.

"Ameriprise financial is primarily a fee-based brokerage (""financial planning"") firm that provides investment services for individuals through agents.  Working for Ameriprise as an agent is similar in many repects to being an insurance agent.  You are given a number of products to sell and some sales training.  You are expected to generate a list of clients and sell them your services.  Your pay is primarily commission based, although they charge their clients flat fees.  You are also expected to attend regular training meetings with other agents.\n\nTheir preferred products (and thus the ones you make the most commission on) include American Express mutual funds and Variable Universal Life Insurance.\n\nIf you are good at convincing people to buy, you can make a good living.  However, during the first one to two years of practice, you will be working an enormous amount of hours while making relatively little since you have not yet established a client base.  At that stage you will be working mostly from home with little to no guarantee of success.\n\nThe difficulty of getting established directly correlates to how many other agents there are in your area.  Ameriprise places no restrictions on how close together or far apart even their own agents are - you may end up competing with another, potentially more established agent for business if you're not careful.  \n\nOther employers that use a similar structure include Edward Jones, Northwest Mutual, AG Edwards, Fidelity Investments, and Waddell & Reed, among many others.\n\nMost insurance companies operate using an EXTREMELY similar method."

yes. there are many home based businesses out there. me and my business partner specialise in this area to earn money part time in order to create passive income. \n\nthe king of passive income is of course real estate. it will always be like that. however you need the money first to invest in real estate. this is why you are looking for other programs is that correct? the end goal is to ultimately make money from real estate. \n\nplease contact me if you want a list of programs we are actively pursuing at the moment\n\nedit: in the end though it is upto you what you want to do. you cannot sit on your arse and expect money to come through. there is always an element of work to be done. work that nobody else is willing to do. if you do the things that others wont do, you will achieve what others can't have.
2 words...prepaid interest. it is best to close your loan at the end of the month. you will pay less interest and you will still get a month or so off from your next mortgage payment. If your original loan payment is around the first of the month try to close your loan by the 25th or so that way you wont have to pay your next month's payment, and by the time the new lender mails you a statement, it wont be scheduled to pay until the next month.

There are a couple things that you can do\n\n- look for for sell signs in the neighborhood that you're interested.  you can get a sense of how much you need for the house that you like\n\n- get a pre-approval from a bank, this way you know how much a bank is willing to lend you\n\n- ask friends/relatives for referrals of real estate agents.\n\nOnce you contacted the agent, he/she will show you houses that match the critiria you mentioned.  So it's better to know what you want first.
"Document your work.  If she verbally assigns work to you, type out a memo that states your understanding of the assignment.  Put a date and time on the memo and have her sign it.  If she refuses to sign it, start the memo with ""This is my understanding of the assigned work you wish for me to complete.  If there are any discrepancies, please let me know ASAP.""\n\nIf the issue is more of an attitude (hers), then ask her ""why do you treat me like a child?""   Be sure to have your resume in order and all your work in order.\n\nBest thing to do is become proficient in your work - become valuable and let HER superiors know what you accomplish.  If she fires you or you leave, they will know that it is her fault and that you were a loss to the company.\n\nLong term, buy a book on dealing with office personalities and talk this over with close friends or a mentor outside of work.\n\nGood Luck."
"If the market expects interest rates to continue to rise, the value of bonds will continue to decline. If you don't understand why, you should not invest in them. (It is because the bond price reflects the 'discount' from final bond payment based on the prevailing interest rates.)\n\nShares, in general, perform worse in periods of high interest rates.\n\nBut this is where your skill as an investor comes in. Research for companies who you expect to perform regardless of the the state of the economy.

"Increasing the Minimum Wage will force employers to pay more for labor.  In response, companies find ways to reduce labor cost, usually by making more capital investment.  With new efficient machinery and equipment, companies no longer need all those employees and they start laying people off.  Unemployment rises and the economy slows down.  This has been a consistent and recuuring theme with unions and automakers.  The result is 90% of the ""minimum wage"" workers get raises and the other 10% get laid off.  Those 10% find it increasingly difficult to find work because all employers have found ways to produce more with fewer employees through automation.  The companies that are unable to automate (lack of funds or lack of technology) are forced out of business, creating even more employment.  The cycle repeats itself over time and the workforce gets smaller and smaller, gradually getting replaced with automation.  That is one of the reasons why the manufacturing employment in the United States has been dropping over the last 30 years while manufacting output has been rising over the same period.  If you are the one getting the raise, you are better off.  If you are the one getting laid off, you get hurt."

"I agree with you that he is a great photographer. Here is what I found out about him:\n\nMONTE ZUCKER - Transcending Time\nFew people know who Monte Zucker is today. He keeps reinventing himself. Photographs that he continually creates ...some within just the past few weeks ... carry his unmistakable signature only if you know his signature style.\nMonte's images are simple, direct, and emotional. Each of them makes a simple statement. There is nothing in his photographs, except what should be there. All distractions were removed before he snapped the shutter. What you see is what he wants you to see. It's usually a face or a collection of faces. When It's a photograph of an individual, you will immediately know that person. When It's a photograph of a group you'll feel and experience their involvement with each other.\nBased on classical tradition, Monte's portraiture has never strayed far from his original intent - to capture a moment in people's lives and memorialize it for posterity, In his own words, ""I don't photograph the world as it is. I photograph the world as I would like it to be.""\nTo accomplish this goal, Monte seems to always capture the moment with little or no direction. Although he basically controls all of his subjects when they're being photographed, they appear to be completely natural. \nHe's always at the right place at the right time to do that. It's because of his steadfast determination to photograph people at their best angles and in their best light that he's able to continually come up with photographs that the subjects feel are the best picture that they've ever had taken of themselves. Of course, the fact that he's spent over 50 years as a professional photographer/teacher studying and perfecting his photographic technique may have something to do with his success.\nMonte has achieved just about every photographic degree that exists. The United Nations recently honored him as Portrait Photographer of the Year 2002. He feels that his most special honor, however, is the fact that his popularity with photographers of all ages is continually growing."

If this company is public and its stock is traded on a stock exchange, you can find its beta (vs. S&P500) on Yahoo! finance or other financial web sites.\n\nIf you are interested in its beta compared to some other indices, you will need to compare the stock's price movement over a long period of time to the specific index concerned.  Most finance/investment text book will teach that calculation.  \n\nIf this stock is not public, I don't think you can find a beta as it has no price history for the analysis.  Or you can pick another software company of similar size that is public and use its beta as a comparable.\n\nHope this helps.  Good luck.
Canara bank is also an option other than SBI. Vijaya Banks also extend vidyarthi loans. Be sure to take the loan only from a public sector bank and not a private one. While applying for a loan, students can include hostel expenses, the cost of books, equipment, and examination fees in the loan amount. Students going abroad can also include airfare. Loan limit. Nationalised banks sanction student loans up to Rs 3-5 lakh. This is higher for studies abroad-for instance, Canara Bank offers loans of up to Rs 10 lakh. \n\n\n* Banks only disburse loans to account holders in the same bank. \n* Loans have to be backed with 100 per cent collateral in the form of immovable property or a mix of securities. \n* Banks may ask for more than 100 per cent collateral, but students are not obliged to give more. \n* The chances of getting a student loan are lower if the parent/guardian is retired and does not have a steady source of income. This is because the bank has to be paid interest during the period of study. The bank could ask for a personal guarantee from a third party. \n* The bank disburses the loan amount directly to the institute a student is admitted in. \n* Students have to provide the bank with mark sheets every semester/ year to show their progress through the course. \n\nMost nationalised banks sanction loans at the branch level, which means that the loan is usually disbursed in about 3-4 weeks. But if there is even a slight deviation from the norm-as defined by the bank -- in the course applied for and the mix of collateral, the loan may have to be cleared at a higher level.\n\nall the best

The basic difference between the mortgage as a security instrument and a Deed of Trust is that in a Deed of Trust there are three parties involved, the borrower, the lender, and a trustee, whereas in a mortgage document there are only two parties involved, the borrower and the lender. In a Deed of Trust, the borrower conveys title to a trustee who will hold title to the property for the benefit of the lender. The title remains in trust until the loan is paid. \n\nOften a title company, escrow company or bank, is listed as the trustee on the Deed of Trust. When the loan has been paid, the trustee will issue a release deed or trustee's reconveyance deed. This deed of reconveyance should be recorded at the county recorder's office, to make public notice that the loan has been paid and that the lender's interest in the property has ended. \n\nAnother difference between a mortgage and a deed of trust is the manner in which foreclosure proceedings take place. State law will determine the method of foreclosure which must be used. Generally, the rules when using a Deed of Trust allow for a faster foreclosure time than with a judicial foreclosure required with a mortgage. Under a Deed of Trust, when the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender delivers the Deed of Trust to the trustee, who then is instructed to sell the property. \n\nAfter proper notices have been posted and rules are followed, the property is sold at a trustee's sale and the loan is paid. Be careful not to confuse a deed, which conveys title and is evidence of ownership to property, with a Deed of Trust, which is a means of securing a note and providing for foreclosure proceedings.
File a motion for modification.  I don't know how it is in California, but in Colorado, the forms are readily availible online.  Note in your petition how many overnights you have, and document the money that you are already paying her.  Get receipts, bank statements, etc.  Probably like most human beings who don't live with a lawyer by their side doing running commentary, you didn't get receipts from her, but gather up all the witnesses you can.  Note: I don't blame you for that, but the lack of evidence might hurt you.  \nThe courts usually don't care about your expenses (sad, but true), but on the whole, they can't take what isn't there.
Depends on one of two things....price, or priority. Meaning, do you want it there fast or do you want it there cheap? If you want fast, FedEx, UPS, DHL, and etc. can do things within a 24 hr. period if you're willing to spend the extra money. If you're shipping multiple items, these services will sometimes offer a discount. If you want cheap, go with the Postal service. Their rates are based primarily on weight of the package and where it's going. But most 1st class mail takes 2-5 business days to arrive at it's destination in the continental U.S. One exception to this rule pertains to the overnight services I mentioned. If you use their ground services, it can sometimes be cheaper than the Post Office if they're not travelling too far. Most items sent via UPS Ground for example reach their destination within 1-5 business days in the continental US. Hope this helps!

I think that the housing market across the USA is overpriced and that prices will have to go down soon.  I think that the prime rate is going to go up to try to stem inflation  and that will decrease the demand on housing.  You also have the high fuel costs and people may not want to be buying new houses because of the costs of transportation.  On the other side, if the panhandle is anything like here, in Texas, there are fewer housing starts taking place here because most of the contractors are in New Orleans to help reconstruct the city there.  That causes there to be higher demand and fewer new homes being produced.

The tax rate for your home depends on what city, county and state your home is located in.  The value of your home is what is important, not the mortgage amount.  At closing, your Realtor or closing attorney should have provided you with an amount of estimated taxes, and you probably paid a good portion of it at closing.\n\nCheck with your mortgage co to see if they have a tax escrow set up for you (in that your annual taxes are collected as part of your mortgage payment and are piad on your behalf)\n\nIf this house is your primary residence, you should get a homestaed exemption, which reduces your property tax amount, and must be applied for.  (Check your county's website)\n\nRemember, interest paid on your loan is tax deductable, so itemize your expenses next tax period.

"First off, you should word it as ""partner WITH a law firm"" and not ""partner IN"" because partners IN the firm are lawyers who work for the firm and who have achieved some status. You may confuse folks if you do not word it properly.\n\nBefore you get too far into your venture, you should check with your local Bar Association and CPA licensing body to ensure you are not violating any ethical standards by the partnership. In some areas it is illegal for attorneys to partner with other types of professional firms--- especially doctors and lawyers!  This is because the attorney-client relationship is very special and can easily be abused by unethical people. If it is permitted in your city and state, there is probably a clause that no money can change hands between the partner companies-- you can't get a ""finder's fee"" from the attorney who refers you a new client."

Market capitalization, often abbreviated to market cap, is a business term that refers to the aggregate value of a firm's outstanding common shares. In essence, market capitalization reflects the total value of a firm's equity currently available on the market. This measure differs from equity value to the extent that a firm has outstanding stock options or other securities convertible to common shares. The size and growth of a firm's market capitalization is often one of the critical measurements of a public company's success or failure. However, market capitalization may increase or decrease for reasons unrelated to performance such as acquisitions, divestitures and stock repurchases.\n\nMarket capitalization is the number of common shares multiplied by the current price of those shares. The term capitalization is sometimes used as a synonym of market capitalization; more often, it denotes the total amount of funds used to finance a firm's balance sheet and is calculated as market capitalization plus debt (book or market value) plus preferred stock.\n\nThe total  market capitalization of all the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange is greater than the amount of money in the United States [1]. The global market capitalization for all stock markets was $43.6 trillion in March 2006 [2

Hi, Did you get her license plate number off of her vehicle?  If so, you should be able to track down the vehicle through the department of motor vehicles, if your state allows it.  If you have no luck there, it sounds like you have a situation where you may need to file a small claim suit against her which should cost you around $100 and you can ask the judge for reimbursement for this amount (providing you can at least get her mailing address to file with).  If not, sounds like you are stuck with paying for your own repair.  It might be a good idea to shop around and get more than one estimate for repair...good luck

I definitely feel your pain, and you have my very best wishes, not only for finding a job, but for finding the patience to wait out the interminable hunt.\n\nI'm not a resident of South Australia, but I did a quick search and discovered that the current jobless rate is somewhere near 5%. Apparently that's somewhat of an improvement over previous periods, but the only people happy with a 5% unemployment rate are the people that don't have to look for a job.\n\nThere are ways to improve your chances of being hired, but no guarantees. Here's some general advice - do with it what you will:\n\nFirst of all, it's not clear to me that your spotty academic record is keeping you from getting considered for jobs. It sounds like you're not even being offered interviews for many of the positions you're applying for - and at that point, unless things work differently in South Australia, the person evaluating your resume isn't even aware of what your grades were like. I think the first thing you need to worry about is figuring out why you're not getting your foot in the door.\n\nWhen hiring officers receive a stack of applications, you have to realize that most of them look very much alike. A quick scan of all the resumes confirms that the candidates have the minimally required education for the position - and then the officer needs to winnow down a very similar stack.\n\nOne strong weapon in your arsenal is the cover letter. Put together a letter that highlights your strengths, using powerful words that make you sound enthusiastic, dedicated, determined, a quick learner, etc. One often overlooked step is to do some background research about the company that you're applying to - know what it is that this company does - and incorporate that knowledge into your correspondence. If the company does accounting for the medical industry, speak specifically of your interest (and knowledge?) about medical billing - if the company does accounting for corporations, write about your interest in corporate ethics and securities regulation.\n\nKeep the letter short and to the point. Tell your reader that you are highly motivated to succeed and that you're the kind of person who works extra hours until the work is done, rather than a clock watcher. But definitely demonstrate that you've done your homework, and that you know something about the business - hiring managers LOVE that.\n\nOnce you've got your foot in the door for an interview, arrive early - dress better than the people you hope to be working with - look the interviewer in the eye, shake hands firmly - answer questions thoughtfully, and be sure to thank the interviewer for his or her time - and write a follow-up thank you note directly to that person.\n\nHang in there. I've been exactly where you are - and I really understand how difficult and frustrating it can be. Best of luck to you!
I have been reading so much about credit.  On many documents that I have read it's good that you have the balance spread out on all your credit cards.  The Equity Loan that you would get will be at a higher interest rate, so the best thing that I would probably suggest is to possibly  find a way to increase your credit score to possibly 720 or higher and then refi your home loan, because you will be able to get a better interest rate than consider paying off those balances with a lower interest rate.  \nP.S if you need more info on credit, I can defenitely give you some info..
"It is true that there are a lot of ""services"" that buy houses directly from homeowners.  However you will be walking away from a lot of money.  \n\nIf you need to sell your house quickly I would do this.  I would ask one of these services for an estimate.  I would then interview 3 top real estate agents in the area.  I would ask them for an estimate of the value of the house.  Say you get an offer from the company for 150K and the real estate agents say the house is worth 210K.  I would sign a listing agreement for 30 days and offer the house at 191K which will yield you 180K(the average) when you take out the commission.  Or you might consider asking 195K to give you a little room to offer closing help or offer 4% to the buyer agent."

"The first step is to prepare a business plan. Even if you will not be applying for a bank loan, a business plan helps you to think through your business - what it needs, who it will benefit, how much it will cost, and what is its potential. Here are free business plans on childcare business that you may want to look into:\n\nhttp://www.sba.gov/library/pubs/mp-30.doc\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/BPWORKBK.pdf\nhttp://www.misbtdc.org/documents/CDCPLAN.pdf\nhttp://sbdcnet.utsa.edu/sbic/bplans.htm \n\nYou may want to read the free article ""How To Start Your Own Day Care Center"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol40/daycare.htm It covers various aspects of starting and running a daycare center including the demand for daycare centers, how to start this business, shoestring strategies, how to operate a daycare center, tips on caring for the children, income potential, how to manage your daycare, marketing your business and other additional income potential. There are so many things to learn about the business that the first step is to read everything you can find.\n\nFor in-depth information, I suggest checking out the following books:\n\n- Start and Run a Profitable Home Day Care \n- The Daycare Provider's Workbook \n- Start Your Own At-Home Child Care Business \n- So You Want to Open a Profitable Child Care Center : \nEverything You Need to Know to Plan, Organize and Implement a Successful Program \n\nIt is also important that you learn the tax rules affecting daycare centers, especially if you are going to open one from your home. Here is the IRS page on child care centers: http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/industries/content/0,,id=99878,00.html\n\nAs for the licenses and requirements in your state, the Administration for Children and Families provide a state by state listing of contacts for licensing and regulations governing child care businesses:\nhttp://www.nccic.org/statedata/dirs/regoffic.html"

Statistics can give you an outline or good idea of what to expect in the future by analyzing past facts and figures in order to render a more educated decision. History does have a way of repeating itself and by looking at statics in a current market trend you can forcast a possible scenario based upon what may have already transpired in a similar situation.
At this time natural resource funds ( particularly oil ) are doing quite well. Look at T.Rowe Price PRNEX.\n\nAlso, telecommunications are performing well.
"Try to get the house in your name only.  If you cannot qualify for the payment by yourself, but you have good credit, you will need compare the rate with both of you vs. the rate for you alone on a ""no income verification"" loan.\n\n20% is a great down payment.  More than that usually does not give significant benefits, but may depending on the loan type.  There are a lot of mortgage brokers in Canada.  Tell them what your scores are, and what you want to do.  They should be able to give you information without pulling your credit so you can compare rates and fees."
"Riiiiiiiiiiiight. \n\nNever work on the problem; just get rid of those that notice it. The ole ""sweep the problem under the rug"" trick. Even though I love my job, I hate how the place is run. Disgruntled employee? Well YEAH! I am. And time and time again I see morale issues being handled by reprimanding us and telling us to ""act professionally."" Threats being made to people that are unhappy with how something is run is ludicrious. It's such a ""control"" thing. People in authority hate to say, ""I'm wrong."" So they transfer blame to the common man and try to make the weak feel weaker. It blows my mind that not all people are willing to step back from a situation and seriously look at solutions to the greater whole. \n\nSure, fire all of the unhappy people. You will then probably have an empty workplace. But hey.....there won't be any complaints about how you run things now. *cough* Until you hire your next bunch of heathens. ;)"
When we started our automotive business, we printed flyers on colored paper off our computer and rubber banded them on mailboxes- maybe include a coupon- lots of people like that.  Good luck!
This again depends on the coin itself for starters. Most jewelers or pawn shops will not buy something like that at the cost of gold as they would have to refine it, which costs money and/or time.... Maybe you could get 60% od spot price of total weight of gold, now remember that the kt also plays a factor.... such as 14kt gold is only just over half percent pure gold....if you have a half ounce and its 14kt, with gold at $700 per oz figure 60% of $350 if you are lucky and find the right place. You may wish to try a coin shop as the coin itself may have its own value beyond the gold... Good Luck

"Affordable Housing is sometimes referred to by gov't when they are approving a building project.  When a developer wants to build a mega something and the town needs more housing for the lower income population they will require ""affordable housing units"" to be built.  It is not uncommon to set aside a few units in luxury buildings as ""affordable housing"".  While regular rent could be $2000 per month, the units set aside for low income might be half that.\n\nThere would be a criteria which would vary from city to city or state to state as to what 'low income' is.  There is not a Federal standard."
"That can be a tricky one. There are plenty of ""get rich quick"" schemes online and they all prey on one thing... people's greediness to make money as quickly and easily as possible. First let me discuss what to avoid...\n\n1) Chain letters. You've probably seen it... it starts with something disguised as news or a testimonial. Then you get on to the pitch, which is, here is a list of people and you have to send $5 cash to each of them, requesting a ""report"". Then you drop off the bottom person and put your name on the top and start spamming everyone on the internet hoping to get more gullible people to sign up. \n\n2) Paid surveys. Yeah, all these companies with products are just itching to give away millions on research by giving every lucky participant a bundle of cash. Or a $500 gift card to your favorite retail store. Or a new laptop.\n\n3) Home-based data entry or typing. If they try to charge you a fee to get into their ""training program"" then it would probably be better to pass.\n\n4) Multi-level marketing. This actually comes in two flavors, scams, and legitimate opportunities. The latter can then be sub-divided into different groups, those that offer legitimate useful product at a reasonable cost, and those that have over-priced products just to pay all the people ""bonuses"" for signing up other people. \n\nI think #4 offers the best potential IF one can find an honest company with a product that offers value at a price so reasonable that ""selling"" it is a no-brainer. On top of that, the company should show integrity and maybe even have full financial disclosure right on the website to build the trust of customers and potential associates. \n\nSince I have yet to find such a company, I'm actually doing some brainstorming right this minute on what types of features a website should have to implement this.\n\nIn fact, I was almost about to post a question with a similar theme. If anybody wants to know more, and has a bit of talent in sales, teaching, or writing, feel free to give me a holler. I'd be glad to share details, get feedback, etc. Until then, best wishes for your search!"
Individual retirement account, of which there are now two types: traditional and Roth.  Traditional IRA's allow one to contribute with tax-deductible money, but the income eventually drawn from the account will be taxed.  A Roth IRA has contributions from after-tax income, but the eventual disbursements will be tax-free.  Each has limitations on contribution levels, based on whether or not you also have a 401k, as well as rules about what age withdrawals can be made, what age withdrawals must be made, and when money can be withdrawn penalty-free.
Hmm, not really. Thanks for the 2 points though friend. Good luck.

The actual name is Royal Oak Mines Inc. They were in trouble a while back because of how contaminated one of their mining sites were. They had one of their liscenses revoked. They estimated it would cost 7.5 million dollars to clean it up. They had diesel spills and several other big environmental hazards. This actually happened at the Colomac Mine around 1998-1999. Royal Oak  has also had some other legal actions taken against them that have been in the news something regarding one of their employees pension plans or something like that. Hope this was helpful
All three credit bureaus have forms they will mail you or you can file your disputes on line.
Stock dividends are generally not taxable. The following is from the irs web site:\n\nDistributions of Stock and Stock Rights\nDistributions by a corporation of its own stock are commonly known as stock dividends. Stock rights (also known as “stock options”) are distributions by a corporation of rights to acquire the corporation's stock. Generally, stock dividends and stock rights are not taxable to you, and you do not report them on your return.
It is hard to forecast potential ad sales for a new website. Your mileage varies - and your income will depend on various factors:\n\n1. Types of advertising model - will you go for CPM, CPC or CPA types of ads\n2. If CPC and CPA, responsiveness of audience to the ads (users looking to book a travel to Spain comes to your site about tourist destinations in Spain then clicks on an ad about hotels in Spain)\n3. Ad format - how many will you run on the pages and what types (banner, rectangle, popup, popunder, leaderboard, sky, invue, interstitial, etc.)\n4. Ad placement - how prominent are your ads\n5. Ad colors - sometimes ads blended into the content works wonders, but sometimes ads that contrast your site colors work best\n6. Will you sell your own advertising or will you use third party networks such as banner networks (BurstMedia, etc) or Google Adsense in which case you only receive a percentage of the profit\n7. Traffic you will get, especially for CPM models
yes it will eventually be recorded properly\nwait n see

Foreign investments work just like any other kind of investments.  The only difference is that changes in currency value can have an added impact, either plus or minus.\n\nAn investment in a company increases in value when more people want to buy the stock.  Supply and demand interaction pushes the stock price up.  What's behind that?  People normally want to buy a stock when it is earning profits and increasing profits.  If the company is making enough money, it may also pay dividends out of those profits.\n\nBusiness is what generates the wealth, plain and simple.
Way too many variables for a quick answer. Call a real estate agent in your area. They know the local market and can help you select an asking price and to make the offer on the house you want.\n\nBTW, K (like in 2K and 3K) means thousand, not hundred thousand. I expect you meant 300K (300,000) and 200K (200,000) not 3K (3,000) and 2K (2,000)
"Yes! Any Historic house will ALWAYS be a good investment. Obviously these types of houses aren't being made anymore for various reasons. First off, the manner in which these older buildings were built is no longer economically feasible. It costs way too much to build new houses with real wood and brick, as a result you see a lot of fiberboard and cheaper building materials being used in new house construction. When a new home is built, they cut many, many corners compared to how an older home was built. You've probably heard the old adage that ""They don't build them like they used to"". In this case it's very true! Also most older homes are made with trees from what are known as ""old growth forests"" instead of ""new growth forests"". ""Old growth"" wood is substantially stronger, more rugged, and even harder than ""new growth"" wood. Wood producers have practical run out of ""old growth"" (from older, mature forests) and what little is left is a lot more expensive than the more common, and softer ""new growth' woods (from newer, non-mature forests). Older homes as a result are built from much better, longer lasting materials. Next, let's talk about architecture. The style of the house is a product of the time during which it was built. Naturally, as times have changed so have the styles of newer buildings. What I'm trying to get at is that older homes are time capsules of bygone eras! In the same way that antique furniture is highly sought after and prized, so too will older, historical homes be sought after and prized (if the haven't been already). Older homes are rarer and harder to come by, and so over time should be worth considerably more than newer homes. Older homes, closer to the center of a town (downtown), usually go through what is known as ""GENTRIFICATION"" at some point. Please google, er um, I mean yahoo this term. All older neighborhoods experience gentrification at some point, the main question is WHEN! If your lucky enough to own the property before gentrification hits you'll be able to ride the wave of prosperity that it'll create (as well as the higher property tax bill)! Georgia is no exception when it comes to gentrification. By the way, just so you know I practice what I preach. I live in a 90 year old beauty in an older San Antonio neighborhood just north of downtown. My property's value has DOUBLED in the last five due to a renewed interest in the area (gentrification). Why, the property's value has increased 10% in the first quarter of 2006 alone! \n\n      Rentals are almost always serious money producers. If you have 3-5 units and if you play it right, your tenants can pay off most of your mortgage for you! On my property, the car garage in the back was converted into a small apartment by the previous owners. I collect enough rent from the person I leased it out to, to pay for 3/4s of my mortgage payment! Rentals are definitely good!\n   \n      As to what one should look for, I'd say that the basics are important. Make sure that the foundation of the house is solid, since foundation repairs can cost tens of thousands of dollars to repair. Make sure that the electrical wiring has been updated (a definite must), that the plumbing is in good repair, and that the roof is in good shape, that the A/C and heating works well, etc. Basicly, you don't want to buy a house that needs more repairs than it's worth. Also look to see what's around your neighborhood that would help to improve the quality of life of anyone who live there. Are there lots of restaurants, shopping centers, parks, museums, movie theaters, librarys, schools, colleges, etc. In my case there are three universities nearby, two city parks, and plenty of shopping centers and restaurants. I hope this has helped you."

Recoveries are taxed in the same manner as the item they are intended to replace. Thus, if the award is to compensate you for a decrease in the share price, it would go to Schedule D. If the recovery is to replace lost dividends, the recovery would be taxed as a dividend.

The best thing is to apply or go through a temp agency. I have office experiance and being hired in at a company I make less then my friend made by going through a temp agency. There are websites online and you could check your local newspaper in the classified job section. A temp agency is the best way to go though since they have lots of contacts and you have potential to make more. My friend that mentioned started out making more then i did and she has no office experience prior, after getting hired in (once the temp time expired) she was given a $2.50 raise. I know that isn't always the norm. of things but since Then i have switched jobs and she still makes more then me. There are local temp agency all over the place. They even have ones that specialize in office workers. Good Luck!
Wow. That first person TOTALLY missed the question. I trade munis. I can tell you exactly what the manager of a bond issue does.\n\nThe manager of the bond issue decides, along with the members or co managers if there are any, what coupons and what structure to do on a bond issue. For example, lets say I was underwriting State of Minnesota GO bonds and I was lead mangager. MN might want $200mm. I might have customers that want par type coupons for the first 10 years, and have institutional customers that want premium coupons 11 and longer years. So, I structure $15mm per year from 2007 thru 2016 as par coupons, and i then do a $25mm term bond as 5 1/2% coupons due in 2020 at a 4.7% yield and $25mm term bonds as 5 1/2% in 2025 as 4.85% yield. When MN signs off on the deal, I decide which customers get which bonds and how many. THAT is what a bond issue manager does.

There can be serious money to be made if you research everything carefully (remember, some of the biggest names on the stockmarket were penny stocks at one point).... however there can also be serious money LOST too.\n\nHere's a typical example of how it COULD work if your lucky, using my Halifax Sharedealer trading account + the shares in my ISP as an example:\nPipex Communications (PXC.L) - I stuck £5 on them in April 2005 when they were valued @ 7.75pence\nWith sharebuilder, that was £3.48 worth of shares, and £1.52 in commission & Stamp Duty. It bagged me 44.897433 shares in them.\n\nNow, imagine you hold onto them shares for bloody ages, so they rise in value to say 50pence a share.\n\n£0.50 x 44.897433 = £22.45 (or £22.4487165 if you don't round that figure up).\n\nThen of course with Penny stocks they don't usually pay out any dividend...... but imagine how much you can earn with that many shares picked up on the cheap once they've matured enough to pay a dividend to re-invest.\n\nLet's say 10pence a share (just to make it easy to work out)\n£0.10 x 44.897433 shares = £4.49 (practically a refund of your initial investment).\n\nBut you've also gotta remember that as there's so many of them for your money... and you've put a fair bit of money on them (and got bloody loads of shares in them as a result), if they go down in value on you, they can give your portfolio's value a right good kicking... so are as risky as trying to get a bj off an Alligator with toothache.
DO anything (legal) and I mean ANYTHING, before filing bankruptcy.  Check out debt consolidators, get a 2nd job, find a rich relative (:) The ramifications of filing bankruptcy will haunt you for a very long time. You won't be able to get a job in any occupation where you need to be licensed (real estate, insurance, government) There are SO many negative thing associated w/bankruptcy, plus these dys it's just plain damn hard to do it! Contact your bill collectors pro-actively, you'd be surprised how kind some of them can be. If you contact them, they'll get off your back, (a bit) plus there's laws now that protect us from harrassment. They can only call you so many times a day and between certain hours, and not if you've contacted them 1st...
you have to have something newsworthy to them, and pitch it, most things never ever get news coverage...

get a small limit credit card, maybe one with a $500 limit, I suggest a gas card. All month long use it to buy gas then when the bill comes pay the balance off in full. You won't get charged intrest and if you use your gas card to buy gas you get cashback bonuses usually. By paying off your balance each month you're adding more points to your FICO score. It may take 6mos. to a year (depending on how bad you messed up your credit) but it's the quickest way to get a better score.

It is an indication that you are in the top choices. Sometimes there are two different types of interviews, and sometimes there is a preliminary panel who filters out people who are not right for the position, then the management above them makes the final decision. I have been on hiring panels before where we made the final decision, but had brought back three interviewees because they all had such stellar qualifications. The second interview had more pointed questions about skills and helped us tease out the best person for the job.

I have recruited for this position. You do not need to be a drug rep or a pharmacist. That is silly. Basically all you need is a BS with a concentration in one of the sciences like chemistry or biology. A business degreee with a minor in one of the sciences is fantastic. \nRemember, a drug rep is a sales person. You need general knowledge of the field but the company will provide training on the specifics of what you will be representing in the field.
It depends on your strategy and the availability of resources. Some questions to consider:\n\n- Can you get a loan? If yes, how expensive will the loan be in terms of interest rates and other repayment terms? Calculate the interest rates you're going to pay in your cashflow projection.\n- Will your cashflow support loan repayments? \n- Will you have sufficient cash flow for the next 6 months? \n\nDepending on your responses above, you can decide on how to capitalize your business.
Hmm... Money begets money!\n\nIf you already have some money, think about day trading.  Some folks equate day-trading with gambling.  But if done cautiously (positive cash-flow, decent P/E), then you can safely exploit the (almost) daily waves in the price.  These waves have nothing to do with the fundamentals.. It's just herd mentality.  You do need 'a lot of patience and fortitude and study', to pick out companies with solid foundations, but which are under-noticed and under-valued.  Then you jump in...  however, you still got to know when to ride the wave and when to cut losses.  One danger is there is not enough material to read on penny companies... that can sometimes surprise you... so beware!\n\nTry some new internet-based pyramid schemes.  Again these are often thought to be shady by most.  The obviously dangerous schemes to avoid are ponzi, chain letters, money for free etc.  But where a 'real' product underlies the pyramid, with (again) positive cash flow, with graded percentage based incentives; it could be a good scheme to generate residual income.  Won't see immediate results though.  Will take 6-8 months of dedicated time investment..but has a high probability of success.\n\nFinally, nothing beats selling on E-Bay.  Make sure you have something unique (though it's not always easy to come up with something unique, given that on an average about 15 million items are on sale on EBay at any given time).  But through courteuos, prompt and honest service, you can gradually rake in a good positive response that will raise your profile among sellers and kick in extra business.
Check out ebay to see what other people sell, and what they sell it for.\nYou must be prepared to be very price competetive.\nSome people sell used items that they want to get rid of, as if it were a electronic garage sale.

"First, any company would be obligated to conduct a thorough and fair investigation before terminating you for sexual harassment. Unfortunately, many of these cases end up being a ""she said"" versus ""he said"" situation. Since the damages from a female alleging harassment can be more than disciplining or terminating a male employee (especially a white male under 40) companies may err on the side of the female. So, it you are the person charged, make your case. Do you have witnesses? Can you prove that you didn't engage in harassing behavior? Will others vouch for your character? Has the female alleging the harassment have a history of making false allegations? You can see H.R. and ask to make a counter claim if you feel confident you are completely innocent."
The Province of Canada declared that all accounts would be kept in dollars and cents as of January 1, 1858, and ordered the issue of the first official Canadian coins in the same year. The colonies that came together in the Canadian Confederation progressively adopted a decimal system over the next few years. Nova Scotia retained its own currency until 1871, whilst Newfoundland issued its own currency until joining the Confederation in 1949.\nFinally, the Federal Parliament passed the Uniform Currency Act in April 1871, tying up loose ends as to the currencies of the various provinces and replacing them with a common Canadian dollar. \nThe Aussies waited until 1966.  They eventually did because they also saw the benefits of a decimal system. \nThe Kiwis followed in 1967 for the same reason.

Since you (or just about any other internal auditor for that matter)are not an expert in the area of marketing, it would be hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the markerting function.  However areas that internal auditors can examine might be:\n1.  Are there policies and procedures that the marketing deptment follows, and is the department following them?\n2.  Does the department get the advertising that is being paid for?  \n3.

Is there a review and approval process for various activities that the department may undertake.\n\nThose are just a couple.....i would probably look at the department and try to think of things that they could mess-up and then what are the controls that could or should be in place to prevent those mistakes/errors.

Before explaining what is Human Poverty Index, let me define what Human Development Index is. The HDI – human development index – is a summary composite index that measures a country's average achievements in three basic aspects of human development: longevity, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Longevity is measured by life expectancy at birth; knowledge is measured by a combination of the adult literacy rate and the combined primary, secondary, and tertiary gross enrolment ratio; and standard of living by GDP per capita.\n Poverty has traditionally been measured as a lack of income - but this is far too narrow a definition. Human poverty is a concept that captures the many dimensions of poverty that exist in both poor and rich countries—it is the denial of choices and opportunities for living a life one has reason to value. The HPI-1 – human poverty index for developing countries – measures human deprivations in the same three aspects of human development as the HDI (longevity, knowledge and a decent standard of living). HPI-2 – human poverty index for selected high-income OECD countries – includes, in addition to the three dimensions in HPI-1, social exclusion.\n\nFor HPI-1 (developing countries): deprivations in longevity are measured by the probability at birth of not surviving to age 40; deprivations in knowledge are measured by the percentage of adults who are illiterate; deprivations in a decent standard of living are measured by two variables: the percentage of people not having sustainable access to an improved water source and the percentage of children below the age of five who are underweight.\n\nFor HPI-2 (selected high-income OECD countries): deprivations in longevity are measured by the probability at birth of not surviving to age 60; deprivations in knowledge are measured by the percentage of adults lacking functional literacy skills; deprivations in a decent standard of living are measured by the percentage of people living below the income poverty line, set at 50% of the adjusted median household disposable income; and social exclusion is measured by the rate of long-term (12 months or more) unemployment of the labour force.

"The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. \n\nLegitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that. They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month. \n\nOther companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).\n\nThe article ""Earning Money from Surveys"" provide a short list of legitimate market research firms and contains explanations of what to look for when joining surveys (and weeding out the fraudulent ones)\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol121/onlinesurvey.htm \n\nPinecone Research http://www.pineconeresearch.com\nGreenField Online http://www.greenfieldonline.com \nHarris Poll Online http://www.harrispollonline.com  \nBuzzBack http://www.buzzback.com  \nSurveySite http://www.surveysite.com \nSurveySavvy http://www.surveysavvy.com\nSurvey Spot http://www.surveyspot.com/\nhttp://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/"

HungryPuppy almsot hit the nail on the head. It is extremely difficult for smaller business interestes to do business with Vietnam unless you 1) bribe governmetn officials 2) use the black market system.\n\nThe recent congress meeting has placed some new leadership in key posiitons that could clean up the corruption, but it could take a while for this to happen. In the meantime, it's a lot easier to deal with exports from Vietnam than to deal with a business within Vietnam.
"The BSE Sensex or BSE Sensitive Index is a value-weighted index composed of 30 companies with the base April 1979 = 100. It consists of the 30 largest and most actively traded stocks, representative of various sectors, on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The set of companies in the index is essentially fixed. These companies account for around one-fifth of the market capitalization of the BSE.\n\nThe SENSEX, short form of the BSE-Sensitive Index, is a ""Market Capitalization-Weighted"" index of 30 stocks representing a sample of large, well-established and financially sound companies. It is the oldest index in India and has acquired a unique place in the collective consciousness of investors. The index is widely used to measure the performance of the Indian stock markets. SENSEX is considered to be the pulse of the Indian stock markets as it represents the underlying universe of listed stocks at The Stock Exchange, Mumbai. Further, as the oldest index of the Indian Stock market, it provides time series data over a fairly long period of time (since 1978-79).\n\nFor a in depth understanding, visit http://www.tradersedgeindia.com/bse_sens..."
"It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nhttp://www.cfda.gov\nhttp://www.grants.gov\nhttp://gtionline.fdncenter.org\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol66/grants.htm\nhttp://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html"

If you think $10/hr is good money, yes.
well, you could take your hourly wage and multiply by 40 for hours a week and then multiply that answer by 52 for number of weeks in year. \nOr you could just look on your tax info to see what you made last year
Give some to charity, buy a new VW car, buy some clothes, shoes & Jewelery, take my family to dine in Peking & put the rest in the Bank.
You look for the direction of sales and what products offered are declining in sales and rising in sales.  All income and expense items are tracked to develop the direction of activity.  The efficiency of management can be measure by the cost of doing business and the profit margins achieved.  All that is part of financial trends.
"The less collateral you have, the ""riskier"" your bond issue is.  As a result, you will have to offer a higher interest rate (coupon rate) in order to induce people to buy your bonds.\n\nMore collateral means less risk, so you can offer a lower coupon rate to bond purchasers."
Market Capitalization (Market Cap) is simply the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares of a company.\n\nFor example, Microsoft (MSFT) has 10.2 billion shares outstanding and each share trades for $23.73. Therefore, it's market cap is $242 billion.
I'm assuming by mortgage insurance you are refering to PMI.  PMI protects the holder of the mortgage (the bank or the investor) in the event the borrower defaults on the home and the home is sold at aution (foreclosure).  For example, you have a loan for $100,000 and your home is sold through a foreclosure sale.  It sells for $50,000.  The PMI covers some of the loss of sale to the bank.  You as the borrower have to pay for this insurance to protect the bank.
ARM = Adjustable Rate Mortgage, this should be avoided when you know that you are going to live in the same house for more than 5 years. ARM mortgage can be 3,5 or 7 yr ARM. In these first 3,5 or 7  yrs are generally fixed and then for rest of the term it is Adjustable.\nFixed rates are best these days if you can get a rate less than 6.75%. If you want to go for adjustable rate make sure there is a cap and it should not go more than 7% otherwise some times the interest payment can go higher than the principle. I am sure you don't want that.\nGood Luck with your Mortgage
"There are many rich people out there who want to help poor people.  But I have never heard of any rich person that individuals can write to for money.  Rich people usually donate to organizations, and these organizations help mostly people in desperate circumstances, who are staving or homeless or owing hundreds of thousands in doctor bills for their kids.  I don't think there is any organization that gives money to people like you. \n\nIf you need help, you can contact food banks in your area or talk to people at your place of worship.  Consider getting a loan, if possible.  \n\nPlease don't spend much time trying to hunt for these mythical ""philanthropists"".  They don't exist."
Bonds are debts of a company or a state. They pay interest rates once per year or quarter. They are less risky than stocks, as long as you buy them and hold them until they expire.\n\nHowever, bond prices fluctuate, inversely with interest rate.\n\nAlso, the company which issued the bonds can go bankrupt, after which their debt becomes worthless. State issued bonds do not have this problem. In principle a gouvernment can always increases taxes to pay-off the bonds.

I am a professional chef.  I have been in the restaurant business for 15 years.  Over half of the restaurants I have worked in have closed.  Here is my word of advice:  If you do not fully understand the restaurant business (inventory turnover, shelf life, appropriate staffing, reservations, production, production capabilities, etc.) 1.  Find someone who is willing to be an investor that is capable of performing these tasks.  Make sure your chef has an interest in the success of the restaurant or,  2.  Find a safer business to get into.  \n\nIf you have specific questions feel free to email me.\nmikechampagne@hotmail.com

The question doesn't make much sense - it's comparing apples to oranges.\n\nA stockholder, arguably, has one primary interest: to maximize the value of the equity they hold, and may or may not have any other relationship to the company whatsoever.\n\nA finance manager is typically employed by a company to ensure that the company uses its capital effectively. \n\nA stockholder would likely want the company within which they hold equity to have a good finance manager.   Other than that, I don't understand the question.
Doesn't matter where you are...the same rules and religious police govern the country.  Women have to keep their head covered, conceal their bodies (can't even show ankles!!!) and have to be escorted by a male (only with legitimate relationship).
I don’t know about racing tipsters but I can say a few things about financial experts. Their reasons are as follows:\n1) The notoriety they gain by being on TV helps there career/business. They want people to hire them to manage their money or invest in their mutual or hedge fund. If they are a TV expert that gives them credibility. \n2) If you fallow their advice you may be helping them out. If they own a stock and get a bunch of people watching TV to buy that stock the price goes up and they make money. \n3) People generally enjoy the ego boost of disseminating their brilliant opinions.

It all depends on how many exemptions you claim on your W-4 and how much you make.  The more exemptions, the LESS they take out.  \n\nYou should ask whoever is in charge of payroll where you work for a new W-4 (they will know what that is).  If you are single, you should claim either 2 or possibly even 3 exemptions.\n\nBTW, I am a CPA.

Advantages of Credit Cards \n\n\nThere is an implicit guarantee of satisfaction with purchases because the customer is able to stop payment on a credit card account for unsatisfactory services. A number of companies guarantee all purchases over the internet. \n\nFree purchase points and merchandise. This is becoming more and more prevalent as credit card companies boost the amount of incentives they provide customers to apply. The more you use your card, the more points towards future purchases you get. \n\nFree airfare mileage points. Credit cards credit you a small percentage of each purchase towards airfare through affiliated airlines. These are like frequent flier miles. Its quite a significant incentive to charge particularly large expenditures on credit cards. \n\nEstablishing credit history and keeping a good credit rating. There are a number of key transactions in modern life which require a good credit rating. Getting a loan or dealing with a mortgage company is one of these. All sorts of other accounts now also include an investigation of your credit rating by the service provider. Credit cards are a perfect way to maintain a good rating. \n\nRe-establish credit rating after bankruptcy or other financial mishap. Those with poor credit histories or those undergoing debt consolidation or credit repair initiatives often use credit cards to repair the damnge. Secured credit cards can be used in such cases where companies are reluctant to issue unsecured credit cards. \nAlso See: Differences Between Secured and Unsecured Credit Cards. \n\n\nOn the internet, credit cards give you the advantage of comparison shopping worldwide. It is the most convenient payment option for this scenario. As ecommerce becomes more and more prevalent, this comes closer and closer to a necessity. Some companies have created services which maximize Internet technology in this regard to full effect. \n\nThe ability to get cash advances. This eliminates the need to go to the bank as customers can simply get the cash they need from their grocery store or other merchant. Note that credit card companies do charge a percentage of the transaction as a fee for the cash advance. But in cases of emergencies or where there is an upper limit to the credit card company's service charge, this is a good option to have. \n\n\n\nDisadvantages of Credit Cards \n\n\n\nThe temptation to aquire too many credit card accounts can lead to losing track of payment details and deadlines. This can be disastrous. It can also lead to a false sense of security where customers continually transfer accounts to new services with lower interest. This rotating form of interest, if not properly disciplined and controlled can lead to balooning payments when late payments occur. When this happens, the interest rate on even the lowest APR credit card can suddenly explode. \n\nDifficulty with understanding the fine print as relating to various fees and charges which may not be initially obvious. It is important to understand how the interest rates on credit card charges is calculated and it is particularly important to keep up with payments. \n\nDepending on the credit card company, it is possible that falling behind with payments will result in an interest charge on all future charges regardless of whether or not you settle your bill during the grace period and by the normal deadline.

ok first u need to go to local Human Services Office (look it up in the phone book) and they can give u a Food Stamps card for emergency food money the same day. the whole process takes about 2-3 hours. The card will buy ur family food for 50 days and then you can apply for regular (not emergency) Food Stamps. It is a big deal when you have a family and out of work. They also will tell you what other financial help options you have. For some you can apply right there, or they give you the address and contact inofrmation.\nNext you can do is got to Salvation Army. They can help with rent/morgage, utility bills and stuff like that for 1 month but it's a 1 in a lifetime deal with them, next time they won't be able to help.\nAlso you can go to church, many of them have special funding to help people in need. They won't give you cash, but can help with bills, food and rent.\nDon't get frustrated, there's always some way out. Good luck
it depends on your bank. give it 10 business days from the date that the government says it sent the money to your account. be sure to hold on to all documentation to show that you actually do have that money coming to you. if there is a discrepancy, your bank can refer to your returns and all other documentation you have
You never know when the reference for this job will be needed...what do you want them to say about you?

When the price increase, the quantity demanded increases also.\n\nQuoted from the Wiki:\nThere are three necessary preconditions for this situation to arise:\n\n-the good in question must be an inferior good, \n-there must be a lack of close substitute goods, and \n-the good must constitute a substantial percentage of the buyer's income.

Generally no. You cannot buy life insurance for anyone. You must have a relationship with such person. There must be insurable interest.\n\nSomeone who lives a dangerous life like a active duty military personnel, a pilot, someone who does extreme sports, etc, are usually not insurable by any insurance company. Though some will do it, but you will have to pay a very high premium.\n\nThere are questions on the life application that the agent must read. If the person you are trying to insure matches any of the dangerous occupations, then the agent must not go further in the application.
"If you are still working there, it's best to say that you are looking for a more challenging / fullfilling position.  That would be true...right?\n\nIf you've already left, some version of the truth works best.  It's good to say that ""my skills and the needs of the company were not a good match"".  Be prepared to give a few examples.\n\nIf you were fired for some serious performance issue, you should at least try to negotiate a ""neutral"" reference from your prior employer (name, dates of employment and rate of pay).  \n\nMost previous employers don't want the potential hassle of giving a bad reference that may backfire on them.  If you want to find out what they're saying, try having someone you know and trust who owns a business call and ask for a reference on you. \n\nYou may be surprised by what you hear."
What I'm about to recommend is not really a job but one way to make money online. Give it a try as it requires no start up cost. \n\nYou can write niche content and make some money via Google Adsense or Yahoo Publisher Network. Both are pay per click programs. Check out this case study https://www.google.com/adsense/askthebuilder It's about Askthebuilder.com earning nearly $30,000 a month with Google Adsense.\n\nCreate sites via free hosting. This way you need not invest any money. Just your valuable time to create websites. You may not get checks almost immediately but with the right methods and hard work, it's definitely a good source of passive income which will come sooner or later. \n\nIf you need more details on ways to work from home, there are some good information and articles from this site. http://earncash.50webs.com
"A Brand Name is simply the name of a company, product, service, or combination of these. (e.g. Coke, Chevrolet, IBM, Jelly Belly, etc.) If you want to get technical, you can also have ""Sub-brands"" like Cherry Coke, Diet Coke, etc.\n\nA TradeMark is something entirely different. It's simply a legally protected word or phrase, used to ""protect"" that word or phrase. Typically protection only applies within a specific business category (e.g. beverages) and within a specific country. The protection prevents others in the industry from using the same phrase. Examples of things that may bear a trademark are brand names, taglines (""The choice of a new generation""), or the names of sub-brands or specific services: ""McGriddle"". It's also possible to trademark sounds (the ABC tones, the sound of a Harley Davidson engine) and logos (but sometimes with limited success - Harley Davidson was not successful. - the sound was deemed too generic and therefore ""not ownable"".)\n\nDon't confuse TM with Copyright - A copyright is obtained by registering an entire text, song, or other full proprietary creation like a book, article, lyrics, etc."
Pre-alert is a means of notifying importer about his goods arriving. Say, You are importer in US and expect shipment to arrive for you from Indonesia. You ask your shipping company/customs broker/ import clearance broker to give you a pre-alert on arriving shipments. They'll usually notify you thrre-four days before the shipment arrives, so that you are able to prepare all customs documents for customs clearance.\n\nHope this helps.\nGood luck.

The banks have two ways of storing those items. \n\nOne: The have several sites in which they process the checks depending on were you account resides (which state). In these processing sites they have designated areas to house processed checks. They are store in boxes sorted in several ways. The sorter process is done by a huge sorter machine that reads the MICR line informmation in the checks. They usually sort it by account number. This same machine arrange the checks in the same order as the statements are printed.\n\nSeconde method: Some banks take the digital image of the checks to clear it or process it and store them in databases to be printed with the customer statements. Some of the banks that operate with digital images makes them available via internet even before statements are printed.
No, you can't, both of the previous answers were completely incorrect, and if you listen to them you will get in trouble with the IRS.\n\nTo invest in a Roth IRA, like any IRA, you need to have earned income in at least the amount you want to invest.  Thus if you want to put $1000, you have to have earned at least $1000.  If you want to max it out, you have to have earned at least $4000.\n\nThe lone exception here is the spousal IRA rule.  You don't have to show any earned income if your spouse made at least as much to cover both of you.  So if you both want to max it out, and you show no income, your spouse would have to have shown at least $8000.\n\nAs far as the upper income limits, if you're a single filer, you can do the full $4000 if you make $90,000 or less (Adjusted Gross Icnome).  From $90,000 to $110,000 is a phase-out range.  If you make over $110,000, you can no longer do the Roth.  Hopefully your company will allow you a Roth 401(k) in this case.\n\nIf you're married and filing jointly, your combined AGI must be $150,000 or less.  From $150,000 to $160,000 is the phase-out range, and over $160,000 is likewise excluded.\n\nHope this helps!\n--J.

"It does sound odd, but here is an example:\n\n""The 1990 Clean Air Act allows the EPA to grant ""emissions permits"" for certain pollutants. These are, in effect, rights to pollute that can be traded among polluters. Imagine a giant bubble that encloses all existing sources of air pollution. Within that bubble some emitters may pollute over the control level as long as other polluters compensate by polluting less. The government or some other authority decides on the desired level of pollution and the initial distribution of pollution rights within an industry or for a geographic region—the ""bubble"" that encloses these sources. Purchases and sales of permits within the ""bubble"" should reduce the total level of pollution to the allowable limit at the lowest total cost. \n\nFor example, a St. Louis study found that the cost of reducing particulate emissions for a paper-products factory was $4 per ton, while the cost to a brewery was $600 per ton. The Clean Air Act could require St. Louis to reduce its emissions by a certain amount. Under the traditional approach, the brewery and the paper factory would each be required to cut emissions by, say, ten tons. The cost to the paper factory would be only $40, while the cost to the brewery would be $6,000. But with tradable permits, the brewery could pay the paper factory to cut emissions by twenty tons so that the brewery could continue to operate without reducing emissions at all. The net result is the same emission reduction of twenty tons as under the command-and-control approach, but the total cost to society of the reduction is only $80 instead of $6,040."""

I have friends that are currently bartenders and questioned a number of other bartenders regarding this in the past.  They've all had the same general statement:  Avoid bartending school.  While they might be able to teach you the drink recipes, you can do the same on your own just by picking up a book.\n\nNever aim for a high-traffic bar as your first place to work.  If you can't keep up at a fast pace, you'll be fired.  If you choose to start at a restaurant, you usually have to be a server first.  In some cases, the only way to be involved directly in the bartending process at a restaurant is to have all the bartenders vote to have you trained when a position is available.\n\nA hotel might be your first place to start.  I used to work in a hotel, and knew the bartending manager.  Someone with a good personality and a willingness to learn was all it truly took to be hired for the job.  He did on the job training, and gave material for the employees to study.  Anyone that could outshine the other bartenders (adapting and re-inventing drinks to improve upon the basics) were sure to move on to other venues.\n\nFrom there, you would want to move into a night club if at all possible.  The traffic is much heavier, and the tipping tends to be better.\n\nOverall, I wish you luck in your endeavors!  It's been a job that I've always been a bit interested in, but felt that my life's path was leading me in a different direction instead.  :)
Talk to your immediate upline people, they can help!  Piggyback on some of their meetings, informational sessions, etc.  \n\nGet a few successes under your belt, and it'll come easier.  Good luck!

I wouldn't buy I-bonds at the moment.  Once you buy them, you can't sell them for at least a year.  You can do just as well (earn a rate equal to or better what you can earn on an I-bond) putting money into a six month or one year CD.  Or perhaps a money market fund (search around, you can earn 4.5% in a basic MMF as of now), which would pay a tad less than a one year CD, but presumably the rate will increase going forward as there is little reason to think the Fed is done raising rates.

The question is about withholding, not tax liability, and the answer depends on the state you're in.  If you are not a non-resident alien, the Federal government with not withhold any taxes, regardless of how long you lived in the property.  State withholding varies from state to state. Here in CA, if you don't have an exemptable reason  3 1/3% of the SALE PRICE of the property will be withheld.

"No.  Cold calling is not the most difficult part of the sales cycle.\n\nI think the hardest part of the sales cycle is selling you on you so that you can get ready to sell.  \n \nBy that I mean this: It's easy to pick up the phone and mess up a sales opportunity OR accidentally succeed at a sales call. \n\nIt's difficult to get yourself ready to sell.   It's difficult to get yourself to the point where you never permit yourself to waste a sales opportunity.  To do so requires that you clear your head and lay out what you need for each of the dozens of calls you need to make per day. \n\nNone of those calls should be thought of as calls you can afford to ""waste"".  So, I like to recommend that people consider thinking of cold calls as ""acquaintance calls"".   \n\nFeeling that you're calling to make someone acquainted with your company, products, and services is a lot less stressful than thinking of ""cold calls"".\n\nHere's wishing you the best of the best in your sales success.\nLinkedin Blogger"

Unfortunately most repossessed houses are sold by a semi- private auction to make up for the amount of debt someone puts on house.  There are many insider professionals that buy houses like this for a living that are already on the inside and willing to pay near market value for the house.  So you wont really find much of a deal with reposed houses. Also many times with these repossed houses (Pending on what stage of forclosure) the previous owner might have up to a year to pay back the debt and receive back the rights to the house, this means you may not actually get to live in the property for up to a year after you close.  Besides, think of the houses that normally get repossessed... I am guessing a majority of them wont be in places you want to live.  Also when people are forced to leave a forclosed home, generally, they are pissed off the bank is taking their home from them and dont leave it in the best condition... It is often TRASHED!!! I recommend if you want to save money first shop for you loan, determine how much you want to spend, then look for your house... This is something most people do not do, then they find the house they fall in love with but either cannot afford it or get screwed by the mortgage agent.

I believe it is an offer that you make without seeing the inside.  In other words, you see the place from the curb, and make a bid for it.

Your credit rating is a measurment of how safe of an investment you are. If you have a high Credit rating you are considered safe. If you have severall loans you are not necessarily considered to be an unsafe lendee. However if you miss payments or some of your loans are credit card based and near or at the credit limit you would be considered risky.\nMoney is money, and you would want to borrow money at the lowest interst rate possible. You need to look into the current interest rate you are paying and compare it to the consolidation interest rate.\nWhen a person applies for a lot of creidt in a short amount of time their credit rating is affected adversely. Due to this if you are getting this consolidation loan near to another loan you received you could damage your credit rating slightly.\nHowever, paying off high interest loans with the consolidation loan and then making your payments on time would do more good than bad.

"I looked a long time, through maybe 50-60 glossaries, trying to find a real estate definition for ""hard corner"" listed someplace.\n\nIn real estate, the closest I got was: A hard cost is an actual cost of construction.  Hard money loan is a mortgage based primarily on the condition and value of the property.  \n\nSome commercial real estate listings for sale use the term ""hard corner"" to describe their property.  A hard corner, as it applies to real estate, seems to be a term used to describe a commercial real estate property located directly on a hard curbed corner.  It is a corner lot located at a busy intersection. There can be a traffic signal at that intersection, or not.  It is a desirable location."

"An organization in which well-managed human diversity is woven throughout all functions and levels is better able to meet the major business challenge of the 21st century--the need for adaptability. Organizational adaptability is necessary for success in a business environment characterized by the proliferation of markets across a wide spectrum of national, cultural and ethnic boundaries in the U.S. and abroad and by increasing competition everywhere. \n\nDiversity in Business: Highlights\n• Diversity optimizes the willingness and ability of all employees to contribute to business success. \n\n• Demographic trends indicate a workplace of the future comprising ever more human differences. \n\n• Diversity differs from affirmative action in its emphasis on qualitative, not quantitative, goals. \n\n• Research shows that heterogeneity contributes to productivity and innovation in working groups. \n\n• Diversity training reduces stereotyping, prejudice and cross-cultural misunderstandings. \n\n• A ""culture of inclusion"" requires institutional openness to diverse styles, ideas and perspectives. \n\n• Diversifying a firm's leadership is indispensable for attaining the long-term benefits of diversity. \n\n• A diversity audit is an excellent first step in planning organizational change to support diversity. \n\n• White male backlash is a significant challenge to diversity. White males cannot be ignored. \n\n• Adaptability is vital in this era of business globalization. Diversity enhances adaptability."
Data entry, specifically for medical records, is one of the target areas for fraudulent businesses.  Many companies promise a work-at-home environment and an ease of finding work, all you need to do is buy their high-priced software.  What they don't tell you is that the majority of doctor offices send out their records to industry-based data entry services.\n\nI would suggest that you go to the Federal Trade Commissions website and review their articles concerning home-based businesses and scams.  It will help you discern fraudulent companies from legitimate ones.
I have been doing this thing off and on. It's hard to get in with the right agency. One that's not going to make you look trashy. Work hard, and don't compromise. Don't smoke; it takes years off your face. Take care of yourself as in exercise and eating right. Keep your hair and nails in shape at all times. Wear sunscreen everyday. The sun is bad for your skin. Use foundation with an SPF of at least 15 in it. Keep your skin moisturized. Oh yea, if your not skinny most of them will not even look at you. Even if your not fat they'll tell you that you can be a plus size model. But don't be discouraged. Work is work as long as it's not nasty work. Know what I mean.

"The important thing when dealing with paying off your old debt is to be CERTAIN that any negative report is removed from your credit history.  Just saying it's ""paid in full"" means nothing when it also says it was in collections or late payments.\n\nBefore you pay a dime on you debt, be sure the creditor agrees IN WRITING to remove the listing from your history.  Once they have your money it's not likely they will work with you.\n\nBy the way, if the creditor tells you it's illegal for them to do it, they are lying.  Read the Fair Credit Reporting act, and the Fair and Accurate Reporting Act.  There is noting in there preventing a creditor from removing their listings!"
Yes. My sister works in the fashion industry, and was a Visual Merchandiser before owning her own shop.\n\nI'd advise you to approach companies and offer to do merchandising for them for free or ask if you can shadow a merchandiser to start with, to build up your experience. Carity shops would be a good place to build up experience.\n\nAlso, don't be frightened or think its beneath you to get a Saturday job in a clothes shop as a sales assitant, and ask if you can work with the merchandiser when they come round. All experince will be useful ultimately.
"Hi,\n\nTo be honest, you are probably not going to find a job working from home. Most of what you are going to find are scams where you will be asked to pay money and receive a list of places you can contact to apply to work online.\n\nI receive an RSS feed of all questions from Yahoo Answers that mention the terms ""Job Search"", ""job Find"" or ""Job Seek"". Most of the questions I see ask about online jobs. I have not seen one that said they were working at home.\n\nThe most important thing to remember about job searches is that you should use a combination of methods regardless of your location.\n\nNetworking - Register at your local Unemployment Office (you don't need to be on unemployment to register for their assistance). They often will have networking groups on a regular basis. They also are a good source for the jobs that never show up in the paper or online.\n\nCheck your local paper -- In many cases the paper's classified are now online.\n\nSearch Smart Online -- If you don't have a lot of time, spend most of your time at sites that aggregate the job feeds from several job search engines. Prominently these include indeed.com and thingamajob.com.\n\nOrganization -- I am the lead developer of a free online application that allows you to track your ads, jobs you apply for, send or print mail merged correspondence, and track your job search history.

The main thing to really consider in order to decide is the time you plan on living the property.  Anything less than 2 years I say rent because when you add up closing costs at buying plus agent fees and legal fees at selling you may end up loosing money.  But if you plan on staying for 3 or more years then buy because of the tax benefits you get plus the appreciation of the property will be enough to cover for the aforementioned items and then some.
Your best bet would be going to an Accountant or accounting services and asked for help in filing your taxes in order for you to get your maximum return.

It's very rare that there will be just one side even with the most illiquid of stocks.  It happens once in a while for a short period of time for some things.  Usually, there will be someone out there who will give you a very bad price, but you should still be able to get out at some price if you really want to.  Check the liquidity and volume of the stock that you have along with the bid/ask spreads and it should give a general idea.
"It really depends upon what your risk tolerance is and what your return expectations are of an investment.  Likewise, are you looking long term, medium or short term?\n\nOnehint is stay away from most stocks under $5 a share.  There's a reason why they're so cheap and generally it's not a good reason.  THat's not to say all cheap stocks are high risk but be sure to do your homework.  The combination of factorsd I personally look for are (a) consistent financial performance of the company in general and a consistent price graph for the stock; (b) a history of consistent dividend payments which I usually have reinvested as stock instead of taking the cash; (c) those companies which pay dividends, it's always nice to see periodic increases in dividend payouts or, alternatively, no decrease in dividend payouts; (d) if I can get all of that and there's a history of stock splits I'm usually chomping at the bit; and (e) we all need a little bit of luck combined with some basic research on the company's financial position, prior performance, cash position (to pay out those lovely dividends!).\n\nOne last thing - invest smart. One thing I tell those new to investing is only invest that amount which you are willing and ready to lose.  Not a doomsday approach but you don't want to have a bad taste in your mouth if the market goes ""bad"" on you and your investments take a hit.\n\nGood Luck!"

If there was an estate, they may have a claim against the money that was inherited.  I would suggest talking to an attorney about that.  \n\nIf there was no estate, however, or no inheritance, there is no legitimate way to force you to take over someone else's bills in this way unless you co-signed on the loans or took responsibility for them in some other way.  Please follow up on this, because it is senseless to let someone take advantage of you unfairly.

Start by contacting small business in your area that don't have a web 'presence'. Explain to them the advantages of having a web site, whether simple or complex. Offer some samples of your work. Start small, work as inexpensively as possible to compete with established web designers. Gradually build up a list of clients--your 'portfolio'--that you can use show to other prospects.  \n\nSoon you'll be tackling bigger and more profitable accounts. Good luck!
Those are mainly stupid questions. If they are coming in for a live interview, HR or someone should have already screened them that they are qualified for the job. Asking those quesitons will just convince this engineer you don't have a clue. Instead, tell them about a real problem someone in this job would handle, and ask them how they would go about correcting it. All the other questions are bunk.
Much of this depends on what you have in mind that the coffee shop will provide, and on where you are located.\n\nStart with a business plan. There is software available that will ask the right questions to help you visualize what you want to achieve with more clarity, and then will lead you through a lot of the planning stages to get to where you want to go. Business Plan Pro is one example of this type of software.\n\nIf it's a simple mom-and-pop serving coffee only or just coffee and pastries, the equipment can be gotten lots of places. The cheapest commercial equipment can usually be had at auction or at used restaurant equipment suppliers.\n\nYour supplies can come from the grocery store, or you can deal with coffee suppliers and a bakery. It all depends on your dream.\n\nThe business reference area of your local library will have books of suppliers, anything from a business-to-business yellow pages to grand books of national manufacturers.\n\nIf you have the location in mind already for your coffee shop, check with the municipality regarding codes and requirements for a certificate that allows you to legally open for food service.

Basic Steps in How Stock Trading Works\nTrading stocks. You hear that phrase all the time, although it really is wrong – you don’t trade stocks like baseball cards (I’ll trade you 100 IBMs for 100 Intels). \nTrade = Buy or Sell \nTo “trade” means to buy and sell in the jargon of the financial markets. How a system that can accommodate one billion shares trading in a single day works is a mystery to most people. No doubt, our financial markets are marvels of technological efficiency. \nYet, they still must handle your order for 100 shares of Acme Kumquats with the same care and documentation as my order of 100,000 shares of MegaCorp. \n\nYou don’t need to know all of the technical details of how you buy and sell stocks, however it is important to have a basic understanding of how the markets work. If you want to dig deeper, there are links to articles explaining the technical side of the markets. \n\nTwo Basic Methods \nThere are two basic ways exchanges execute a trade: \n\nOn the exchange floor \nElectronically \nThere is a strong push to move more trading to the networks and off the trading floors, however this push is meeting with some resistance. Most markets, most notably the NASDAQ, trade stocks electronically. The futures’ markets trade in person on the floor of several exchanges, but that’s a different topic. \n\n\nExchange floor\nTrading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) is the image most people have thanks to television and the movies of how the market works. When the market is open, you see hundreds of people rushing about shouting and gesturing to one another, talking on phones, watching monitors, and entering data into terminals. It could not look any more chaotic. \n\nYet, at the end of the day, the markets workout all the trades and get ready for the next day. Here is a step-by-step walk through the execution of a simple trade on the NYSE. \n\n\nYou tell your broker to buy 100 shares of Acme Kumquats at market. \nYour broker’s order department sends the order to their floor clerk on the exchange. \nThe floor clerk alerts one of the firm’s floor traders who finds another floor trader willing to sell 100 shares of Acme Kumquats. This is easier than is sounds, because the floor trader knows which floor traders make markets in particular stocks. \nThe two agree on a price and complete the deal. The notification process goes back up the line and your broker calls you back with the final price. The process may take a few minutes or longer depending on the stock and the market. A few days later, you will receive the confirmation notice in the mail. \nOf course, this example was a simple trade, complex trades and large blocks of stocks involve considerable more detail. \n\n\nElectronically \nIn this fast moving world, some are wondering how long a human-based system like the NYSE can continue to provide the level of service necessary. The NYSE handles a small percentage of its volume electronically, while the rival NASDAQ is completely electronic. \nThe electronic markets use vast computer networks to match buyers and sellers, rather than human brokers. While this system lacks the romantic and exciting images of the NYSE floor, it is efficient and fast. Many large institutional traders, such as pension funds, mutual funds, and so forth, prefer this method of trading. \n\nFor the individual investor, you frequently can get almost instant confirmations on your trades, if that is important to you. It also facilitates further control of online investing by putting you one step closer to the market. \n\nYou still need a broker to handle your trades – individuals don’t have access to the electronic markets. Your broker accesses the exchange network and the system finds a buyer or seller depending on your order. \n\n\nConclusion\nWhat does this all mean to you? If the system works, and it does most of the time, all of this will be hidden from you, however if something goes wrong it

"pamplmouss2 - \nThanks for asking.\nWhile former President Richard Nixon (with help from Henry Kissinger) opened the door to trade with this once-sleeping dragon, it seems as if global trade has shifted from American being a major EXporter to a major IMporter of Chinese-made goods.\nWith this new-found influx of American dollars, the Chinese government continues to suppress its people, pollute its land and flaunt its military strength.\nFormer President George H.W. Bush really helped China invade our economy and allowed further violation of human rights (i.e., \nTiananmen Square, 1989).\nIt was as if America bowed its head to the Chinese chopping block.\nOur current president is just as bad, showing little or no concern to turn the trade deficit in our favor.\nAmerica has been sold down the river.\nAs China grows, its demand for energy (i.e., oil - the stuff that drives our bigass SUV's) creates a supply/demand rise in petroleum prices.\nAnd guess who suffers?\nAm I angry at Chinese people?\nNo.\nAm I angry at our own government for selling us out?\nYes.\nThe Chinese are playing by their rules...we don't have to play, but we choose to do so.\nWe're to blame for losing our leadership in goods and services.\nAnd as history has shown, nations rise and fall.\nSome three thousand years ago, China was a world leader.\nI suppose the pendulum of time is swinging back in Chinas' favor.\nWe Americans are so caught up with our self-infatuated image that we still don't see it coming.\nWe'd rather watch ""American Idol"" than study the lessons of history, learn math and science and re-energize our nation.\nWe get what we deserve."

If you are doing the paying demand it. Your insurance company would not pay until they saw it.
you have to call around to shop for a good rate.  some agents will try take advantage of you because you are new to this...so they quote you a higher rate so they get more commission.  make sure you talk to a couple of agents before you decide to go with someone.\n\ni am a loan agent myself so i know how they work.\n\nif you do not want to go to a loan agent, go directly to a bank of credit union\n\n...but i suggest going through a loan agent because we work for a broker who has access to hundreds of lenders who can offer more competetive pricing versus to just one bank.\n\nif you have more questions, feel free to ask...\n\ndont forget, you are not obligated to go through that person just because they gave you a quote.
The lease is a contract, and thus can not be changed by one party without the consent of the other.  I don't see how they can succeed with an eviction where they have nothing to show that you owe $615.  In eviction court the looser has to pay the winner's attorney fee. Good luck !
The way markets have crashed today I doubt whether anyone will be in a position to answer your querry with certainity.\nIts better to wait and watch how the market performs for a day or two before investing further.
It depends upon the other outstanding bids.\n\nIf it is on the NASDAQ and the bid is 49 and the ask is 49.50 and you offer to buy at 49.25 and you are the only bidder, then you should become the new bid price raising the bid/ask to 49.25 and 49.50.  If there are other bids that may not happen.\n\nIf it is on the exchanges, then you are bidding outside the range.  You will limit the prices when the current best offer is taken, presuming no one else will make an intervening bid.\n\nMarket makers cannot bid against the street, BUT if there are other outstanding orders, they are not bidding against the street.  So they may keep the old if there are outstanding valid prices because your purchase offer is not in the money as the high bid.

Sounds like the regional manager is trying to cover her mistake in hiring the guy.  Report it and report the theft.  If he saw the kid take the money then that is all the proof he needs.  She must have told him that he would get fired.  Some companies expect loyalty from employees though and if thefts are occuring on a shift they DO fire everyone for not watching out for the thefts.  The company can hire and fire anyone they wish.  In this case he was watching out for thefts and caught the kid, what else would a company ask from a manager/employee?

Join some professional English speaking learmning class in your town or nearby place. Also check the English terminology of common day terms of your language. Try to speak in English with your brothers, sisters, relatives and friends.

"Using ""straw"" borrowers is illegal practice. You have the person, the one with bad credit bad income etc that wants to buy the house. They broker, real estate agent or even the person buying or selling the house recruits the ""straw"" to use their income, credit etc. They receive a profit from using this information. The reason this is illegal is because it is misrepresentation to the lender. No one is protected from financial loss because if the lender finds out you are doing this they can call the loan or foreclose on the property and all parties can be prosecuted under certain State laws against this practice and any monies exchanged or placed in escrow can be seized. This is considered mortgage fraud!!!!"

The key to financial well being is looking ahead with the right attitude.  If your hubby has been looking for a year, he probably feels like dog poop and so do you.  There is no magic solution, but you might think of selling your house and moving to an apartment, relocating to a different place or starting your own business.  Your real key to a real solution is motivation and you don't just pick that up off the street. \nFind some professional financial advice first and get some spiritual help, perhaps at your local church.  Get involved in groups.  You find jobs not in the want ads but because someone knows you and recommends you.  Be prepared to make some serious changes.  Better to sell your house and lose some than lose everything to a foreclosure.  Although it seems trite, undergoing hardship can make you stronger.  I became a bartender after being laid off from a high paying job some years ago.  It's inexpensive as education funds go and you get the money back in short order. It was only temporary, but it got the funds coming in again without losing everything. Sit down and go over the positive aspects of both your lives and see what talents you have.  You might just be looking in the wrong place.  God bless you!

I do not live in OH at all.  However you can contact your Department of Housing Authority who are in charge of offering Section 8 to anyone who needs it.  \n\nCheck your local phone book under Government pages and find DHA under State/County/City.  Also be aware that the list is long for those who are applying for Section 8, so it may take a while for you to get it.  The best you can do is fulfill their requirements as best as possible, attend your assigned appointments, and this way the process will speed up.  Sometimes if you miss on something, it can prevent from proceding.  \n\nCheck out Ohio Housing Finance Agency's website @\n\nOhioHome.org\n\nThey are a housing finance agency which helps you with mortages, Section 8 needs, and more.  They are your part of your State's government agencies.  Find the Section 8 icon, click on it and it will give you the list of complexes accepting Section 8, you may find something you like there.  \n\nGood luck!

I am not sure that i have understand your question! Let me tyu to answer. The voltage in Greece is 220v as in most European countries. The electric cable has 3 poles ( i mean the smaller cables). The one is with the 220v and its colour its always Black or Red or Brown(you will find red or brown in older cables and in old house with an old wiring). Second is neutral which is always Blue or Gray.\nThe ground cable is always Yellow/Green (both colours on the same cable). \nHope i have helped!
Generally, an easement giving access to your property cannot be blocked under any circumstances.  Any lawyer in your area who specializes in real estate law will know and can assist, or the real estate agent who sold you your property.  \n\nYou can also contact the city councilmember or county supervisor who represents your area for assistance. The county administrator's office where you live will be able to tell you who best to contact.  \n\nA county land assessor/surveyor will be able to establish the property lines for each of you, and you might be able to look up the easement information as part of public record.  \n\nAlthough the easement may be on your neighbor's property, ownership does not give them the right to block access, and their property deed probably details what can or cannot be done with the easement.  \n\nThe quicker you take action the better, as waiting can sometimes be contstrued as your silent acceptance of what your neighbor is doing.  Easement problems can be very difficult, and it is best to get help as soon as possible.  Good luck!

I used to be a server and sometimes I think you are working with a bunch of angry people that hate their job and are only there cause they feel the have to be and have no drive to do anything else.  Being a server is a hard job, but it can also be a fun job that some people make a lot of money at if they are in the right location (upscale casual to upscale... no chains).\n\nMy advice to you is to make sure that your customers are happy and take care of the needs in your section and help out when you can.  And of course, make sure that you keep your managers happy.  Screw those bad temper chicks.    If they are always constantly in the weeds and don't know how to consolidate to take care of their tables than they need to ask for smaller sections.  BE SURE... not sacrifice the level of service that you give to your customers to help them if they don't appreciate it.  This hurts your tips. \n\nBy the way, you may be too nice.  They may be walking over you because they feel they can.  And if you help them, make sure they help you.\n\nAlso, when you are giving your tables good service, their guest will notice and those people will start to ask for you cause they always see you taking care of your guest.\n\nAs far as they one that call you a name, she is just insecure and was probably out of meds that day.\n\nNow go earn that 20% tip.\n\n:)

Well, most people should learn how to handle money, and learn why credit is really voluntary servitude, but they don't teach that in school, either.\n\nAt some point in time, you have to draw a line about what is proper for the school to teach, and what the parents/family have to teach.

I read in court docs that they cannot withold your security deposit for basic wear and tear, now if you remove fixtures or put holes in the wall tear up stuff pretty bad, that warrants them keeping it. Otherwise, you have a right to get it back.  Generally a landlord repaints and puts new carpet in between tenants if one was there for that long. In my experience at least.  I mean, i dont know about you but for one 500 is alot of money to me, and for two, its principal that you didnt cause serious damage and should get it back.  Id call the local housing board or HUD or whatever and see what your state laws are. If your in the right, consult a lawyer.

You will also have to pay mortgage insurance being you are not putting 20% down so your payment will be higher.

Well, your additional comments kind answer your question. The thing with inflation is the next. Prices start going up, mainly caused by excess in demand, lets try to see it with a simple example. If prices of raw material go up, final distributors have to rise prices to obtain the same level of profit. Everyone can raise prices if they want, but what happens with the consumers. They can´t ask for a rise, they have annual contracts. So prices go up, income stays the same. Businesses have to close or turn down production. With less production, less people are employed. Less people employed, less income to spend and the thing becomes very critical. So economical system enters a recession or, if not treated correctly, a depression. Depression with inflation means high prices and little income to buy them... if you still got your job. Politically, central banks have 1 prioritary goal, which is to mantain the purchasing power of their currency. So when inflation is hiking up, central banks try to do anything to stop it. How? Raising intrest rates to stop investment and consumption, which will lower demand for goodsA more extreme measure, but rarely followed because of the political cost, would be a tighter fiscal policy,which in short states to rise taxation. The Us is right now trying to avoid, or cool down inflation, by hiking up intrest rates. So, for some 2 years, the political agenda has been a rise in intrest rates, when 10 years ago it was the other way around!\n\nHope that helps. Good luck!
For a monthly payment of $550, paying off in 10 years, you can only borrow around $50,000 (at 6.125%). So that covers your debts and repairs, but not much else. \n\nUnfortunately, depending how much you owe on your house, you probably wouldn't get a rate of 6.125%. Second mortages tend to run 8-9% or higher depending on your credit rating. This would cap your borrowing at around $45,000 to keep that $550 payment.
YES! I personally have purchased 2 houses and a 3 unit apartment house this way. I put a grand total of 12 dollars down payment ( in MI, a real estate contract isn't valid unless some money changes hands) I flipped 2 of them and kept the 3 unit for a couple of years, then sold it too. My credit score is around 525 but I never went through any credit checks with the owners. It does take a LOT of persistence and determination though.

Many times realtors won't advertise old or abandoned places because of the cost of the newspaper ads.  But there's always one somewhere in the back of their file that they never thought they'd sell.  Good luck!

"There is a tax whenever people leave a large estate to their kids.  The same amount is taxed again when those kids leave money to their kids.  The money was taxed when it was earned, it was taxed when it was passed to the first generation, then taxed a third time when it was passed to the next generation.  To avoid one layer of taxes, rich people pass their money to their grandchildren directly, especially when their kids don't really need it.  Congress doesn't like not getting money, so they passed a Generation Skipping Tax to get some of that.\n\nBy definition, a ""skip person"" is either 2+ generations younger and related to the deceased, or is unrelated and at least 37 1/2 years younger."
Once you find someone you think you are interested in, get to know them. Go out to lunch, invite them to your house for the afternoon. Just spend time with them, with and without the children, to get to see their personality.
go to chef school, and spend hours upon hours learning proper cooking methods. Then you have to build a name for yourself to make any real money.....and you will be spending hours upon hours of everyday cooking at your resturaunt.

It depends on where you live. In some states the repossession is not final until your redemption rights are exhausted. If you file you may seek return of the car but you will most likely have to show proof of insurance and the bankruptcy court may limit your use of the car. You should contact an experienced bankrupty lawyer. There are a number of experienced practitioners who are part of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy attorneys. Find it on the web at nacba.com.

You'll have to do the research to find all the companies in your field, whatever that is, and ask them.
The homeowners policy is attached to the residence you have listed, typically your home.\nThe car insurance policy is attached to the car you own, no matter where you live.\n\nIF you have an insurance package with your car and homeowners insurance combined then the rule is still the same.  Of course it would be a good idea to tell the insurance company where you are living and where  the car is being parked, since this could effect your car insurance rates.\n\nHomeowners insurance, by itself, will NOT cover your car insurance.

From a Contractor's Perspective:\n\nContract closeout is the period between Substantial Completion and Final Completion. E.g. from the time that the building is complete & open (Certificate of Occupancy), to the time that all remaining items are complete and all outstanding monies are paid.\n\nContract closeout is usually tying up all the minor loose ends in a contract required in order to get the remaineder of funds released to you, and to call the contract complete, with no outstanding obligations.
"Depends on what kind of farm it is. There is mostly factory-farming these days, where the animals are confined.\nOn a dairy factory farm, the cows will not leave their confines, they are made pregnant artificially so they continue to generate milk. Their calves are taken away at birth and confined to crates in the dark, where they cannot even stand up, to become veal. Keeping the calves from developing muscle equals anemia, but makes the farmer more money. The colustrum (produced by the mother as super nourishment for baby calves right after they are born) is not given to the calves, it is used in other profitable products, like supplements for body builders. The females are slaughtered or kept to raise as milk machines as the older dairy cows become less productive.\nDairy cows are fed hormones to make them produce much more milk than is normal and antibiotics to keep sickness down when confined with hundreds of other animals.\nThe normal life expectancy of a dairy cow is 25-30 years. A factory farmed cow, 3-4 years and then they are hauled off to the slaughterhouse for more abuse and the torture that ends their pitiful lives. They are not free to roam in pastures, raise their young or do any of the things instinctive to cows.\nCows get mastitis and illness from being constantly milked.\nEven if this is an organic dairy farm, they have slightly better conditions, I wouldn't want this job.\nI understand you may like ""working on a farm"", just please understand it's not like what's portrayed on TV and fairytale books. It's big business. There ARE no happy cows, in CA or anywhere else.\nI don't think there are ANY positives to this job."

Never ask anyone on your team to work harder than you do.  Give credit where credit is due...do not hog the spotlight when your team or a single member does a great job.  Always treat the members of your team with the same respect that you expect from them.   Leave slang and four letter words out of your vocabulary at work.  Keep work at work,  home at home.   Get to know each member of your team...and remember to have compassion when they need it.   Set goals that are attainable.\nGood luck.

You are most likely gonna get stuck paying til the lease is over even if you move. Unless they are civil and both decide to pay half and let you leave.

Call around to local insurance company's and tell them about your business, ask them for referrals.

you can get many answers on this one and i don't know how small the amount of money is you got. If it has to be fast like in a years time your options are the forex market, options and maybe small caps at the Nasdaq.\n\nThere's always risk involved with investing and trading but look at it from the bright side: your chances of succeeding - if you know what you're doing -  is 50/50 which is way, way much better than casino gambling and the lottery. With investing the odds seem to be somewhat better.\n\nFor trading and investing a must is that you're educated about the subject. Please avoid people who make promises, there is no such thing as promises or guarantees. If there's a catch then you know something is up. You increase your chances significantly if you develop an understanding of the market and the tools of the trade.\n\nSome might say investing is safer than trading, but this is rather relative since therea are also safe trading systems. Depends on how you look at it. Investing implies a long term strategy but the rewards are smaller while trading may have higher risks but the rewards are much larger. Risk is dependant on the individual and you therefore need to develop a trading system of your own if you want to grow your money fast with high leverage. Today online brokers have practice accounts available to learn the craft without risking a dime. I just hope you're not desperate and broke. Scared money rarely wins...\n\nIf in the end you rather invest than i can recommend stock funds with Fidelity and the Soros Quantum Fund. They've done very well in the past 20 years.

But having a receptionist route the wife's call, a golfing buddy, the client who just left, etc..  is a waste of a good receptionist.  \n\nAnd please pay this position well.  And I mean well.

"Hey Wojo...\n\nI'm a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and have been working in the industry since 1976....since about 1984 as a Chef.  As a Chef I've earned different sums depending on where I was, what exactly I was doing and for what type of operation.  First of all the word ""Chef"" is one of the most miss-used around.  Most people who call themselves a ""Chef"" are actually more of a kitchen manager that has no formal training or experience with an apprentice program.  The person above that stated that ""The chef at Wendy's makes $6.00 an hour"" is a great example...obviously there are no Chefs at Wendys.\n\nIf you are just starting out it'll be some time before you need to be worried about what the person running the kitchen makes.  There are a number of levels to go through first and getting the experience at all of those levels will determine what you make as a Chef or if you can even get a job as one.  A real Executive Chef at a top rated international resort OUTSIDE of the US can make 6 figures plus a nice package of benefits including housing and automobile BUT that's after years of work in those same high quality resorts making 2k a month with a poor benefit package working 12-16 hours a day!\n\nFor an American Chef INSIDE the US it's a different story.  I think you can count on $2k a month as a Sous Chef.....maybe $3k in a large hotel.....maybe $3.5 as an Executive Sous Chef in a very large, high quality resort like the ones in Las Vegas.  experienced Chefs in small privately owned restaurants do around $3k a month....few go over $5k....and many more make under $3k a month....Executive Chefs in Hotels are between $3k and $5k a month depending on size and quality....the big jobs in very large extremely high quality places are higher...can be into 6 figures....but there aren't very many of them at all.......\n\nNow for the bad news....lol.....although the working hours and sometimes the conditions in institutions are great, the pay isn't.  The organizational chart of an institutional kitchen is entirely different from a restaurant or hotel.  You’ll find a Registered Dietician or equivalent somewhere at the top and depending on where you are a person with a lower level nutrition certification below that......most don’t have a real “Chef” on the payroll.  They’ll work with a very professional recipe book designed to get around the creative process that yields a less consistent product.  The whole thing will be simplified.  Having said that there’s a non-profit here in my city that does meals on wheels and bunch of other things....a VERY large operation....it has a Chef that makes in the $40s....he’s very experienced.....they have a Registered Dietician that makes in the $60s....respectable for their decent work week I’d say, but that’s certainly not the norm.\n\nHere’s the real truth....everyone looks at a couple celebrity Chefs or the 3-4 really high profile Executive Chefs positions like in Disney World Hotels and thinks that is what Chefs do and make.....but for every one of those there are a thousand working 80 hours a week for less than $30k a year.  Stay in it because you love it and money MAY come.  Your best bet if you really want to be making decent money is to get a high powered degree behind you; Johnson & Wales or CIA....get strong experience in high profile resort hotels showing enough loyalty and maturity to stay 2 years in each position....get one position as a Sous Chef in a high profile resort hotel...and then approach an international head hunter...Toronto, New York, London...interview and beg them to carry you in their portfolio.  Working overseas in top quality resorts is the absolutely best money in the industry...it also allows you to return with an impressive resume and then make top dollar in the US!\n\nGood luck Wojo...only do this if you love it and hard work is in your blood!

If you are far into the program, I would stick it out and finish it up.  Nursing careers can take a lot of directions.  A lot of nurses who decide they aren't interested anymore in hands-on nursing go into management, training, or even research fields.  There are also a WHOLE HUGE number of nurses doing jobs other than nursing because they've become disenchanted with the pay and working conditions in our current healthcare morass.  Which is to say that a nursing degree tells employers that while you may be trained as a nurse, you are educated, you are trainable, you have certain transferable skills, etc.\n\nIf you are still early in your program - maybe different.  In that case you may want to do a quick gut check and maybe change direction before you get too far invested.  A career or guidance counselor may be able to help you.  If nothing else you may want to switch to a liberal arts type of program that gets you a general degree and doesn't lock you into a field.

"Did you sign an occupancy affidavit at the closing?\n\nDo not use a ""free"" rental agreement or one of those standard forms from Staples or whatever.  I could tell you hundreds of horror stories from people who used those agreements and screwed themself royally.  Same thing with deciding to be a landlord when you know absolutely nothing about it.\n\nDo yourself a great big favor.  Make an appointment with the top landlord/tenant lawyer in your area.  Make sure that is their specialty.  Pay them to do a lease that is specific for your area and your needs.  Have them give you a crash course on local landlord/tenant law and how it applies to you and your proposed situation.  The $100 to $200 it costs you now could save you thousands and thousands in the end.\n\nA true horror story from my office:\n\nWoman rents out her condo when she is transferred.  She buys a ""legal"" lease from one of those landlord sites and uses it.  A year later, she decides to sell the condo and make some serious money while the market is hot.  This way she can buy a new place where she now lives, pay cash and have a huge chunk of change left over.\n\nShe gives the tenants 30 days notice a month before their lease is up.  The tenants say they aren't going anywhere.  So, she comes to our office to evict them.  We tell her ""Sorry, but your tenant doesn't ever have to leave if they don't want to as long as they pay their rent because 1) in this county, if you rent a condo to someone, it must state in big bold letters at the top that it is a condo and subject to sale or else you are required to give them a 2 YEAR notice if you are ending their tenancy if you want to sell the place, 2) leases in this state automatically renew themselves on a month to month basis and you don't have a right to evict simply because a lease is ending under the anti-eviction act of this state and 3) this $9.99 bargain of a lease does not contain the all-important ""right of re-entry"" clause needed in order to evict for cause in this state, so the fact that you didn't tell them in the lease that it is a condo doesn't even really matter at this point.  They don't ever have to leave even if they did give you cause to evict.""\n\nShe's hysterical because prices more than doubled in the past year.  Her 150K condo is under contract for 320K, and now she can't sell it because of this.  She wants to sue the online landlord site because they told her the lease is ""perfectly legal"".  We have to tell her she doesn't have a case because ... the lease is perfectly legal, it's just not in her best interests. \n\nDon't be a schmuck over $100 to $200.  Pay a professional for their expertise and advice."
"Depends entirely on your state.\n\nFor example, Florida does not have a state income tax, so they charge heavy taxes on mortgage loans.  \n\nFees are broken down into many parts, and without listing what the fees are going to, it is not fair to make a judgment call on your fees.  If, for example, $3,000 is going to state taxes, then this loan is not very expensive at all.  If, however, $3,000 is going to the broker as ""origination"", ""points"" or the like, then it MIGHT be an expensive loan.\n\nIn Ohio, you would expect to pay about $2,300 in the basic, non-broker, related costs.  This includes title, pre-paids, taxes, and insurance escrows.  This would mean about $2,100 to the broker.\n\nIn the scheme of things, $2,100 is not a lot of money to pay a broker - depending on whether they are also getting paid on the interest rate.  Look for a little number somewhere on your ""Settlement Statement"" called ""YSP"" or ""Premium"" or Yeild Spread Premium.  The number next to this (not added in the big column) is the amount the broker is getting from the bank outside of closing for arranging this loan. \n\nIn our example, if this amount was about $1,000, I would say this broker was fairly paid.  Some might disagree with me, but about $3,300 in broker income is average for the industry.  If it is over this, you'll need to consider what you are comfortable paying.\n\nIf you are within 3 days of the loan closing, you have the right to ""rescind"" the transaction by following the directions on the rescion paperwork.  Follow them closely, as you likely have to fax the paperwork to the lender - not your broker.\n\nIf it is after 3 days, you'll be happy to know you are better informed today than you were then.  You likley will have no recourse.\n\nSee a lawyer if you feel really screwed, but don't rely on the end cost to make your decision.  You can pay off a 30 year mortgage about 6 years early by simply making an extra payment each year.\n\nFinally, if your credit is bad, you should expect to pay more.  It's not that you are getting screwed, it's just people are taking a bigger risk lending you money.\n\nBest of Luck."

More than likely they have a plan for this office already.  Someone has probably already beat you to the punch by lining up this office for themselves. What I would do is to ask around and see if anyone else knows about this office and what is going to be done with it.\n  When you do go to your boss about this office you should come up with some good reasons why it would be important for you to have an office.  Do you recieve phone calls in which confidentiality would be important?  Do you think that this office would increase your productivity?  Do you have the space requirements that would merit an office?  \n  Really what you gotta do is show that you have a need for the office and not just a want.

Your question is a very common one. Naturally everyone wants true wholesale pricing but the answer really depends on how much business potential you can offer to the wholesaler or distributor. You can only get wholesale pricing (legitimate) with a business license and/or Tax ID to show that you are a reseller. If they don't ask for the form(s), I can assure you they are not legitimate. You can find directories of wholesalers at your local library... they are a little too expensive to buiy on your own. Try to find some that will work with you as a small business but remember these places are bombarded with requests to buy products at wholesale pricing and they won't do it for a few of this and a couple of that. It's got to be a win-win situation for you and the wholesaler so sharpen your presentation and ask for a break to get your business running.

Here is the instruction on how to redeem damaged currency from the US bureau of Engraving and Printing web site:\n\nhttp://www.bep.treas.gov/document.cfm/10/63/2426\n\nAll large size banknotes (anything dated before 1928) have collector value well beyond face value, even in damaged condition. Same with many 1928, 1929, and 1934 issues. You would probably do well selling it on eBay.
Instead of a Psychic why not try God.  If you pray about the situation and turn it over to him asking him to open the door to what is truly right for you and leave it in his hands you will be amazed.

Awrite mate, I catch ur drift, been there done that. It's just for the money but ur gona need to bullsh*t ur way in.\n\nGo on about how Barclays is an internationally recognised bank which would be great opportunity for personal development. You realise how at a young age this work experience will be invaluable and a career with one of these banks is something that interests you greatly. Talk about how you are highly motivated and very much interested in career progression. DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE WAGE! Never mention the chance to earn a big salary, they will think this is all you are after - guaranteed.\n\n Other questions may be along the lines of: give an example of a situation where you solved a problem, what was the outcome, what would you do differently next time. Give an example of when you have come up with an innovative solution. Give an example of when you have worked as part of a team, what was your role. Give an example of when you have led a team. What are ur strengths/weaknesses. Give an example of when you have planned something from scratch through to completion, again, how was it, what would you change. Give an example of when you have communicated effectively. (Remember the big corporations are looking for more than academic prowess, they want the social skills as well, so show you can work with others) Etc etc\n\nBest of luck - knock 'em dead!

Advantages of Mutual Funds\n\n\nThe advantages of investing in a Mutual Fund are:\n\n    * Diversification: The best mutual funds design their portfolios so individual investments will react differently to the same economic conditions. For example, economic conditions like a rise in interest rates may cause certain securities in a diversified portfolio to decrease in value. Other securities in the portfolio will respond to the same economic conditions by increasing in value. When a portfolio is balanced in this way, the value of the overall portfolio should gradually increase over time, even if some securities lose value.\n\n    * Professional Management:Most mutual funds pay topflight professionals to manage their investments. These managers decide what securities the fund will buy and sell.\n\n    * Regulatory oversight: Mutual funds are subject to many government regulations that protect investors from fraud.\n\n    * Liquidity: It's easy to get your money out of a mutual fund. Write a check, make a call, and you've got the cash.\n\n    * Convenience: You can usually buy mutual fund shares by mail, phone, or over the Internet.\n\n    * Low cost: Mutual fund expenses are often no more than 1.5 percent of your investment. Expenses for Index Funds are less than that, because index funds are not actively managed. Instead, they automatically buy stock in companies that are listed on a specific index\n\n    * Transparency\n\n    * Flexibility\n\n    * Choice of schemes\n\n    * Tax benefits\n\n    * Well regulated

I had a really nasty experience with Natwest years ago. I just bought my first car and I got down to approx £7 just after pay day. Natwest sent me a letter warning that I was close to my limit and charged me £15 which then put me into the red.\n\nI left Natwest shortly after. I'm with First Direct now and I've never had a problem in 15 years.

eBay faces a lot of challenges right now. Once it was the darling of internet stocks, but not anymore.\n\n1. Its main auction model is slowing as ebay faces maturity = to achieve growth, it will have to do so not with its auction site but its acquisitions such as Paypal and eBay. Forbes Magazine has an interesting article on this   http://www.forbes.com/markets/equities/2006/05/08/ebay-skype-0508markets04.html\n\n2. Stiffer competition particularly abroad = early this year, eBay had to scrap seller transaction fees in China due to significant competition from Alibaba.com. Even in Korea, Yahoo is aggressively challenging eBay  http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=17139&hed=Yahoo+Challenges+eBay+in+Korea\n\n3. Sellers are looking for other (cheaper) channels to sell their products = ebay's fees are continuously rising, and sellers are looking for ways to sell their items. They are flocking to ebay's competitors or creating their own ecommerce site\n\n4. Competition from Google = Google has developed GBuy or Google Checkout, which is its main challenge to Paypal http://www.forbes.com/markets/2006/06/09/google-0609markets09.html

I'm a Director also and have the same problem at times.  I work with very young people who may not always take their jobs seriously.  I also am not a micro manager, preferring to allow people to work at their own pace to keep morale up however there are times this doesn't work either.  If all your staff are not following your directives, I would have a staff meeting and in your own words explain the problem you  are having and allow for some professional feedback for your staff.  Remind them that failure to follow their supervisor's directives is insubordination and can result in discipline.  Say you don't want to go this route but if productivity does not improve and directives are not followed, you will have no choice but to do so.  Now if it is an individual or a few individuals, I would meet with them privately (always have a witness though since some staff will exxagerate)and go over the need for teamwork and the above information.  Explain that you are willing to listen to suggestions but directives need to be completed in a timely manner.  I don't order either and my program runs extremely well with a few glitches here and there.  My seasoned staff will tell the problem staff that I am very nice and fair but she does not play when it comes to work and that may be the type of boss you are as well, just needing to toughen up a little.  I never order and I personally resent when people give me orders so I try to show staff respect at all times.  It takes time, but you can correct the problems you are having.  My quess is you have some staff that really like you and just need a little direction.  You may also have some staff who think they can do the job better and therefor will continue to ignore you.  If you earn the respect of your stronger staff, they can help keep the problem staff in line.  And if not, they will understand that the problem staff need to be disciplined.  Much luck to you,  You can get this situation in control with a little effort.
It depends upon where you are located.\n\nIf the house is under foreclosure it is a legal proceeding and if the court has not issued an order assigning the rents to the court or to the mortgage holder then it would be payable to the landlord.\n\nI would stay in the house as long as possible without paying rent to anyone. Once you have recouped your costs from the free rent then either move or contact the mortgage company. Maybe there is an opportunity to become a homeowner.\n\nIf either side provides a court order saying they are entitle to receive the rent then advise the party that you have prepaid X$ to the owner and her Realtor. And will vacate one it is either repaid or been compensated by free rent.\n\nThe mortgage holder will like the idea of someone occupying the house until they are ready to sell it. It is free protection for their property.

the law requires you to report it but if you don't feel in danger of life or his performance don't interfere with your work or others than is up to you what you do, either way try to talk to that person with help of other coworkers who know about it, most likely it wont help too much but at least you try to help, eventually that person will be fired anyway because the boss will find out, it's just a matter of time

I'm not in college yet so I lack experience but my parents told me, and I found from reasearch, that you should try looking for an internship first.

I think it depends on where you live (as you said, Americans are for example rather inclined to get a mortgage) and on you family (if you parents had a mortgage, you kind of grow up with the idea that this is only natural)
the obvious ones:  the damaged goods\nnot so obvious:  the time spent reporting it, phoning suppliers, (because they are still going to invoice you, it left their shipping bay) phoning the shipper, providing proof of the value of the damaged items (digging up copies of the invoice).  The time spent getting rid of the damaged item (if it is large, like a furnace, you have to pay more shipping?)  Depending on the amount of damage, whether the item is usable, or parts can be taken off of it. \nAll that time you could have been doing something else that actually earns money for you...gone.

For a person who is 36 years old should be able to pay for life insurance.\n\nAnyway, I don't know your situation, but if you are living with your parents, then $40,000 coverage is good. But if you are single, I recommend getting at least $100,000.\n\nNow that we cover how much coverage you should get, now you need to understand the two main types of life insurance out there. One is called cash value life insurance, the kind of plan that contains a savings in it. The other is term insurance, the kind of plan that is pure insurance (such as car insurance). In this blog, it goes into details about the difference between the two: http://obe231.blogspot.com\n\nAfter reading that blog, you should be able to figure out which is better, which is buying term and investing at the same time.
My personal preference is houses rather than units, because:\n- land appreciates, which you get with houses, not units\n- you have more financial control with a house, as strata fees can be imposed on you when you have a unit\n- you have more development/improvement opportunities for a house than a unit.

"You cannot patent or copyright a name, you trademark a name.  A ""trademark"" is a word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others.\n\nEvery state issues their own trademarks, but getting a state trademark is virtually useless. The federal registration will for all intents and purposes trump any state registration. For example, if you get a trademark in Florida and use the mark in commerce only in Orlando, Florida, and subsequently another party files for a federal registration on the same mark, you are estopped from using your mark outside of Orlando! Moreover, a state registration does not even entitle you to rights throughout the entire state. Notice in the previous example that I said that if someone were to obtain a federal registration on the same mark for which you had a Florida state registration you would only be able to use the mark in your geographic area, not throughout the state. So if you use the mark in commerce in Orlando, Florida, and someone acquires a federal registration, they can use the mark in Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, etc. The important concept here is that while a state registration is usually much cheaper than a federal registration, state registration provides little or no significant rights.\n\nFinally, in terms of copyright protection for an insurance product, that is likely not the best form of protection.  A copyright only protects expression, not function.  Patents, on the other hand, protect function.  If your insurance product is new and non-obvious you could receive a patent on it, likely a business method patent.  It is wise to seek copyright protection though, because it is so cheap.\n\nIn terms of how long it will take to obtain a patent or trademark, US patents for business methods could easily take 3 to 4 years from the date you file an application.  Trademarks, however, are much quicker.  Normally you would expect the whole process of obtaining a federal trademark in the US to take about 14 months."
Could mean a lot of different things depending on the context. It could be that the office where your company's payroll gets processed is closing temporarily, like for a holiday. Or maybe you have multiple locations where payroll is processed and they're downsizing by closing a few (but not all) of the locations. Or it could be in reference to the end of the year--- they are closing the year so you need to submit your payroll information a little earlier than usual so they can pay everyone on time and still finish out the annual bookkeeping.  Could you please give more detail about how this statement was made?

It's a way of investing in the stock market without the 'direct' risk.  Unit trusts invest in alot of different shares, so the risk is reduced because if one lot of shares go down, they have others to make up the loss.  It is still a riskier investment than deposits and you can still lose money.  It all depends on how much risk you are prepared to take wih your money.  Unit trusts should be viewed as a medium to long term investment (5 years minimum, preferrably more) so don't put in all your money, or any that you will be needing in a short time.  Over a reasonable period of time, unit trusts generally outperform deposits, but there are no guarantees!
No you do not NEED an agent but it might be in your best interest to have one. You are buying a new home. The development most likely has their own selling agent. If you go in without an agent you are only a customer to them. The other agent is not looking out for your interests but his sellers.  It is up to you on whether you want one or not but I would recommend it if you have never purchased a new home so you have someone looking out for your interests.
It depends on what you mean by cheap. Cheap could mean low monthly payments. However, if the insurance doesn’t provide the financial protection you need or the access to the kind of care you want, having the insurance really won’t justify the lower payments. If you’re interested in private insurance, talk with local state-licensed health insurance agents. If you can get insurance through your work that would be the least expensive option, unless you qualify for state-sponsored health insurance. For example, New Jersey has a state-sponsored health insurance program called NJ Family Care that provides low-cost health insurance. Your state insurance department should be able to tell you if they have a similar program.\n\nIf you don’t qualify or are not interested in state-sponsored assistance, many families are choosing HMOs – health maintenance organizations. They have relatively low monthly premiums and include preventive care and regular doctor visits in their plans. However, some people like the freedom of going wherever they want to go for health care, and HMOs offer full coverage only if you visit one of their participating doctors or hospitals. I’ve included a link to a Consumer Reports article about HMOs vs PPOs as well as the newest edition of US News & World Reports Best Health Plans to help you compare plans at a national level.\n\nYou might also want to check out a couple of articles I’ve linked to that provide a good introduction to health insurance – what the different types are, how to find out what type of plan and coverage options are right for you, and how to go about shopping for health insurance.\n\nYou might also want to speak with state-licensed health insurance agents. MostChoice.com is a great way to get in touch with state-licensed insurance agents. You just fill out an information request form and within two days agents will contact you to talk about family health insurance. There’s no cost or obligation, and you can also view instant free quotes on health plans available near you. All you have to do is have your questions ready and tell the agents how much you want to pay and what kind of coverage you expect to get in return.\n\nYou can find it here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nHope this helps,\nBarnes@MostChoice

As far as I am concerned, that is way too long ago for you to spend time digging them up.  It is past the time frame that you need to keep records for....

No.  Americna Express isn't like a traditional credit card, you have to pay the entire amount off each month, you cannot carry a balance like on Visa, Mastercard, Discover, etc.  They are trying to figure out how much your limit should be.  \nAm.

For the most part it depends on what type of loan you are talking about ... home loan? business loan? equity loan??? \n\nThe main advantage is getting the money you need for whatever you need. The main disadvantage is the possibility of losing that asset if something happens that you cannot afford to continue paying. \n\nIn some cases credit unions are better places to get loans than banks but it depends on the amount and use for the money. \n\nIf you don't NEED a loan, don't take one. Why pay interest on loans if you can simply save enough to pay cash even if that means waiting 10 years to avoid a 30 year mortgage???\n\nAlways try to pay more on your loans than minimum requirements to get the debt paid off, reduce the interest, and develop a shiny credit report.

Clean Sheet usually refers to that starting of a project or activity from scratch with nothing currently in existence.\n\nSystematic Design usually refers to the rework of something that currently exists into something else using any number of tools or methods to study, design, deploy and implement the changes.\n\n\n\nSo, using these definitions to answer your question, some of the items to consider are:\n\n* Clean Sheet Pros\n  - Get to fix what is wrong!

USA culture tends to like the Lone Ranger mentality – or is a throw away society.\n- Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n\n* Systematic Design Cons\n - If anything is wrong with the current structure or organization, then legal consequences may result for the management team (i.e. if there is any hazardous waste found on the property, top managers can go to jail).\n - Work with familiar surroundings and just modify what is there.\n - Changing the metal attitudes or culture of the organization can be very hard and time consuming.\n - Is it that people do not like change, or that people do not like forced change!\n\n\nOne of many examples that you could look at this why a management team of a manufacturing organization chooses to either build a new plant in an area where there has never been a manufacturing site before (Clean Sheet – sometimes called Green Site) versus the remodeling of an existing plant to make some product.\n\nYou can search on various web sites to see how some companies have approach this concept.  While some will rebuild existing structures, others may want to set up a entirely new facility in a new area that has not had manufacturing before.\n\n\nOther areas that you can look for information on this question include: Six Sigma, Lean Manufacturing, Toyota Production System (TPD), Ford Production System (FPD), Kaizen, changing culture or behavior topics or instruction system design within the training community. \n\nGood Luck

The IRS does not have any way to correct a 941 that has not yet been filed. When you receive your notice that your payment was late, you can provide them with the explanation you have given above and ask them to waive the penalty for reasonable cause. (They have authority to waive penalties, but they cannot waive interest that is due, so you will have to pay interest if it is charged.) I would attach a statement to the 941 when you file it with the whole explanation. They will probable not read it or act on it at the time it is received, but it is something you can point out when you appeal the penalty later.\n\nRamsGod did not read your info completely. You stated that you have already made up the missed payment for the corporation and will use up the overpayment on the other company before quarter -end.\n\nAn alternative, if you really want it, is to get power-of-attorney forms (form 2848) signed by an authorized officer of each corporation and submitted to the IRS for these 2 companies for the 941 reports. Then you can call them and get the amount that was applied to the wrong company transferred to the correct company. It's more work, but this way neither company will show up as delinquent.

Targeted cover letter\nThis type of letter has immense potential for getting the interview since it is normally sent for an advertised position. You are able to highlight your skills and experience that match the job requirements and motivate why you are the perfect person for the job. It is also called a response letter. \n\nRecommendation cover letter \nThis type of letter produces the best results since you and the company already has something in common. You share an acquaintance. It is used when you have been referred to the enterprise by someone reputable. Make sure that you mention the person's name within the first paragraph of your letter. It is also called the network letter. Always try to get a referrer because it enhances the possibility of getting the job. \n\nReport back cover letter It is also called a follow-up on a previous letter or interview. It may seem desperate but if your wording is correct, it can show determination and attention to detail. It works the same as following up on a sales lead and brings your application to the attention of the recruiter. Use this letter three or more days after an interview to show your interest, highlight skills, and to thank the recruiter for the interview. Try to mention skills and experience that you may have missed during an interview. Do not repeat the information from your first cover letter. It must be fresh and original. \n\nMany recruiters feel that job seekers send cover letters to a broad audience. They are looking for targeted and original letters. The person who receives the letter must think that you are writing specifically for him. It must motivate the recruiter to call you for an interview or job offer. \n\nmore on http://www.cvtips.com/cover_letter_types.html

Why would anyone create such a list?  The note holders would have to be the ones to create such a list, why would they do that?  Now, for real estate notes, the act of recording the mortgage lists the original note holder, but it is common that the actual note holder is not the one listed in the public record.  The credit bureaus will sell that public record information, but it will not be accurate.\n\nThe reason is this.  Imagine that GMAC Mortgage makes a loan to someone.  The record will show the owner as GMAC Mortgage.  However they will then participate the note out to others.  The contract may or may not be recorded in the public record.  Further, if it is held for a trust indenture, none of the actual holders will ever be known except in the case of a bankruptcy of the indenture trustee.\n\nFinally, for private issuers, your ability to assess the quality of the note will be negligable.  You should treat such notes as junk quality as they were not able to get ordinary underwriting.
It depends on the state you live in and what is a taxable item in that state.\n\nFor instance, New Hampshire has no sales tax, so nothing is taxed.  In Massachusetts, there is a 5% tax on everything but clothing and food.\n\nIn Tennessee, there is a 7% sales tax on almost everything (food is a 6% tax) because the state doesn't take an income tax, so they make it back in sales tax.\n\nMost times, if you are shipping something you have bought online, they will apply your states sales tax once you fill in the information about yourself.\n\nSome places also don't have to pay a sales tax.  A non-profit organization (charity, schools, etc) will have a certificate to prove their tax-exempt status for most items.  If they have an event to raise money, they don't have to pay sales tax for the location or food, however, alcohol is always taxable if the state applies it.\n\nYou can check out individual sites for states to see which states have which taxes in more detail, but here is a summary of the states and their sales taxes:\nhttp://www.taxadmin.org/fta/rate/sales.html

"Being ""Black Listed"" isn't a formal list.  It refers to a bad reputation that makes someone a less than desirable employee, making it hard for them to get employed.\n\nThe most famous was the Communist witch hunt.  In this instance, it was created by the government.  Many intellectuals, actors, writers, etc. found themselves unable to get employment because the refused to take part in the witch hunt.  Government agencies threatened harassment if any employer hired these people.\n\nThe government has also made these ""Virtual black lists"" for other reasons.  Howard Stern could claim this.  In early days, many comedians found themselves in this situation because their routines were considered too racy.\n\nSome scientists have also claimed government harassment because they spoke out against the governemnt policies or left government employment.\n\nSocial institutions can also create a virtual black list.  In these instances, they typically try to use economic pressure to prevent employment of individuals.  \n\nA person can be black listed if they gain a bad reputation in their industry.  For example, if an engineer or architect designed a bridge, building, or other structure that failed, they might not be able to get employment in their industry, even if they are cleared later.\n\nA person can also be ""Black listed"" for famous behavior or notoriety shunned by society.  For example, if someone was accused of a well publicized crime and later found innocent, the reputation of the accusation could follow them making employment difficult.\n\nIf a person has had a lot of difficulties at several employers, they can find themselves black listed as their bad reputation follows them from 1 employer to the next.\n\nYou can also find yourself black listed in a company because of a well known goof up or just because a higher level manager doesn't like you.  This can effect pay raises, how you are treated, and your general level of happiness in a company.\n\nIn summary, to be effective, black listing requires at least 1 of the following:\n-Government involvement\nInvolvement by a social institution (such as religion)\n-Well publicized notariety\n-A small community (a small town)\n-A small industry with few employers"

I do my banking onlline, I've done this for a few years.  I do it to save money.  I don't have very good control of myself when it comes to money.  I always pick banks that are not local so I can't go into the branch and get moeny, and I hate paying ATM fees so I very rarely get money out.  I've went through Citibank and loved them, I'm currently with Washington Mutual (Wamu) and I like them too.  I have direct deposit and pay all my bill by mail.  I use my card at the pump for gas and as a credit at the grocery store.  You really don't need cash these days even McDonald's take cards so I feel more comfortabke like this.

"Jail?  No.  Debtors prisons went out way back!  \n\nCouple of things you need to be aware of though ... should the home go into foreclosure - that means the lender had to file legal action against you to obtain the right to sell the property. \n\nIf you do a ""deed in lieu of foreclosure"" you can save yourself a LOT of money.  That would be deeding the RE (real estate) to the lender without them having to take you to court to get it.  \n\nSometimes a ""quit claim deed"" is requested of the lender instead.  \n\nNow ... if the lender sells the home for a lesser amount that is owed on it, you will owe the defincency balance.  The things you mention that you have:  a clear home, money in the bank ... etc etc etc.   Those things can be attached by the lender.  Yes even your home.\n\nTalk to your lender - they have been there before I'm sure. \n\nSee what they suggest.\n\nGood luck."
Dear Sir, this is a very deep question! There are so many ways in which you can prepare yourself - \n\n1. Finances - Make sure your finances are strong so that even after retirement you are able to maintain the same standard of living. Make sure you will be economically stable and independent even after retirement. This means - invest wisely!\n\n2. Emotionally - Here you won't have to do much; the moment you retire, it is like the final homecoming for you. From then on, you will become an indispensible part of the house just like the doors, windows and your wife have been all these years. Yes, you have been in the same family all these years, but from now on, you'll be more into the family than into anything else.\n\n3. Socially - Start gathering contacts of all your friends since childhood. Once you retire you will have lot of time, when you can visit them all and refresh friendships which will make you feel socially secure.\n\n4. Something for your wife - I would suggest that you start learning household chores! :D I know most Indian men hate to work at home. But think - after all these years you are finally getting retired from work - FREEDOM! But for your wife? She will have no difference in her work. In fact, she'll have greater work to do just cos you are at home! So make yourself available for simple, small things at home. IT IS NOT FEMININE TO WORK AT HOME! Unfortunately many Indians consider household chores as work for the females. It is not so! Moreover, it is one way of avoiding boredom.\n\n5. Something for yourself - Start feeling happy! You are going to enter second childhood! A time when you can do anything with no one to question you! I assume most of your responsibilities of life would be over by now or will soon be over. So you'll be a free bird - free to do anything you want! So start getting involved in all your old forgotten hobbies - singing, stamp collecting, reading, writing, etc etc! You may also plan to start visiting places. Try to travel around - pilgrimages or simply fun trips! And if your financial position allows it, do go abroad somewhere (like singapore) with your wife.\n\nYou've worked hard the whole of your life for others; spend the last part for yourself. It's YOUR life! Live it to the fullest!

This is tough, but you are obviously dealing with an HR staff that doesn't have enough faith in their company.\n\nSalary ranges are one of those areas where you only see what YOU want.  For example.  If HR says the job pays from $35-$40k a year.  They want to hire you at $35k.  But if you say, my range is $35-$40k, you really want $40k.  It is just natural human perception.\n\nEven though your attitude is correct, salary negotiations should not be discussed until the point the company wants to hire you, you are stuck in this one.  If you don't put the range on, HR will can your resume because you didn't follow a simple direction.  They have asked for this because they have found that what the company thinks the skills are worth, and what people that hold the skills think their worth, are two very different things.\n\nYou have no choice, but you can beat them at their own game.   Just keep it very vague, something like:\n\nRequested Salary Range:  Mid $40's \n\nJust don't be tempted to lowball your requirements to get the interview.  If you do, your offer will never be what you want, it will be what you stated.\n\nGood luck

You'll find several jobs posted from local companies (car dealers, car rental companies, limo services, etc.), and you can apply for those online.  Then, you check your Yellow Pages to see what OTHER car dealers, car rental companies, limo services, etc. you can find that didn't have jobs posted.\n\nThen, contact those other employers directly to see if they have any jon openings.\n\nAND, follow-up with both the online and the off-line job applications to see keep your job search alive and your application in the mind of the person who's filling the job.\n\nGreat sources of job leads:\n\n*  Indeed.com - http://www.indeed.com\nAggregates job postings from several sources including Monster and CareerBuilder as well as employer Websites\n\n*  JobCentral.com - http://www.jobcentral.com\nHas job postings from 200 of the biggest companies in the U.S. as well as many smaller companies.

Depending on what other income you have besides your social security, you might owe income tax on part of your social security payment, on up to 85% of it.  Whatever part is taxable, if any, is treated for tax calculation just like any other income.  If you're going to owe tax on your social security payments, you should either have taxes taken out, have extra tax taken out of some other income that you have, or make quarterly estimated payments.  If you wait until you file your return, you risk interest and penalties for underpayment.

Investment is anything purchased that you expect (or more accurately hope) to increase in value over time or that will return more than you invested in the first place (ie, granting a loan or opening an interest bearing account).

"Hmmm, this sounds like a bit of a mixed up question. I'll answer as best as I can under English & Welsh law - assuming that's what you want.\n\nThere are two sorts of ways you can own land - freehold (ie you can be in possession forever) and leasehold (ie you're only in possession until the lease comes to an end).\n\nA leasehold title is granted out of a freehold title.  When a lease is created, the freehold title owner becomes the landlord and the leasehold title owner is the tenant.\n\nOnly the leaseholder has the right to occupy the land until the lease comes to an end. That right then reverts to the freeholder.\n\nThis right to re-enter the land when the lease comes to an end is called the ""freehold reversion"".  The landlord is also sometimes known as the reversioner.\n\nIf rent is payable on the lease (and it normally is), it is often known as a ""ground rent"" or ""lease rent"".  The landlord will be entitled to this.\n\nSo I imagine that this reversionary freehold ground rent is the lease payment due to the landlord.  Hope this helps."
If you read your contract or handbook ther will probably be a section where it says that hours will be offered according to availability and that the company will not be liable if there are not enough hours available. If it doesn't have anything similar you're still not in luck, you have very little chance of ever being able to claim any kind of compensation.
Some companies choose to reinvest their profits to make their company grow. Companies that do not give out dividend can and do start giving them out, either as special dividends or regular dividends. Just a little while ago, Microsoft gave out a huge dividend as a one-time deal. If a company does not give out dividends, you make your money when you sell the stock. Any retained earnings should increase the value of the stock.

If the life insurance named a beneficiary, then the policy is a contract between the insured and the insurer and the bank is not allowed by law to intervene in that and therefore they are not entitled to the money.\n\nIf the money was left to an estate, then the bank could make a claim against the estate and get some money for the car loan that way.  Once the estate's bills are paid off, then the remaining money can be divided among the heirs.\n\nThe bank itself may have purchased its own policy on the car with themselves as beneficiary.  This is called BOLI or bank owned life insurance.  It is very common.\n\nJust the same the way the bank can't get the life insurance if they are not the beneficiary, you can't get 'reimbursed' for the funeral expenses if you are not named the beneficiary.\n\nOnly the named beneficiary can decide IF they want to pay the funeral expenses.

For both State and Federal, you'll need to pay estimated taxes (paying taxes ahead of April 15th). Here's a link to the IRS site on estimated taxes: http://www.irs.gov/publications/p505/ch02.html\n\nDepending on how you are set up as a business, you might be using Schedule C from the 1040. And you will probably have to pay a Self-Employment Tax.\n\nOther things you may have to pay for are Net Profits depending on if the business is incorporated (if at all) in a city's boundaries, business licenses, etc.\n\nBut first decide if you are going to incorporate and if you are employing others. The easiest is to just be a sole-proprietor. However, you don't have legal protection (if someone sues you) until you incorporate.\n\nThe easiest and simplest form of corporation is the Limited Liability Company (LLC). Further, a single-member LLC is even simpler in that you only get taxed once -- you don't have certain corporation taxes. Basically, it's almost just setting up legal-protection by filling out a few forms. Otherwise, you just fill out Schedule C and you're set.\n\nHere's a link to the IRS's tips on starting a business. http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=110417,00.html\n\nThis is just a brief overview and certainly just tips (and not proof for the IRS if they audit you). Best to seek out a small business advisor or read up on the IRS website.\n\nGood luck.

My biggest weakness? ....

Well, just go through this with your advisor, imagine if you were to die/become totally and permanently disabled now, how much do you think it would cost to sustain your living/lifestyle? \n\ne.g if you think that $36k is enough to cover for a year of expenses, then take this amount and multiply by how long you think you will need it for. \n\nHow long depends on how long you want to live, the mortgage loan term and if you have children e.g. You will need this insurance payout to last you for at least 20 years(usually). \nTherefore, $36k *20=$720k\nThat calculates the amount of coverage that you would need.\nTake into considerate, if any, the assets you intend to liqidate in case of death/TPD. That could include existing investments and assets like car, house, gold. \n\nYou would be looking at the sum that you need after deducting the assets. That is the amount you ought to be insured for.  \n\nSpousal insurance is bought when the spouse has economic value, ie contributing to the household income. It's best to buy if you don't want to be burdened by heavy financial responsibilities on your own.

It sounds like the information was given to your employer.  If you had insurance through your employer, and they needed certain info in order to process a payment or obtain insurance benefits, the dr. may have been allowed to give out the info under HIPAA without your consent.  HIPAA does not prevent the disclosure of information, but limits it to the ""minimum necessary"" to accomplish the reason for disclosure.  Based on what you typed, you may not have a case against the dr's office.  Additionally, HIPAA does not allow a patient the right to file a suit against the dr, employer, or insurance company.

There is no way to answer this because EVA has some assumptions in it - specifically WACC.  You will need to use an estimate for the Cost of Equity (Ke), the pre-tax cost of debt (Kd) and long run capital structure between debt and equity. Values will vary pretty significantly based on your assumptions.  Ke should be somewhere in the high-teens to low twenties and cost of debt should be bootstrapped off the benchmark government long-bond. Unfortunately, I am not sure which one should be used, but I do know that Kd should be relatively high due to high interest rates in India.

"CEO's performance is evaluated on a couple different things.\n1. The overall performance of the company.\n2. Their performance in managing the current situation of the company.   \n\n1.  The overall performance of the company is more important if, company is operating correctly and profitably in they eyes of the board and powerful shareholders before the CEO took it over.\n2.  Their performance in managing the current situation is typically more important if the company has operational problems and has been performing poorly in their marketplace before the CEO took it over.  However once a CEO has made improvements, the board and stock holders use this new improved situation of the company as the next base to gage future performance.  Hence the short life of many CEO's. \n\nAre CEOs overpaid?\nNo and yes.  Some are, many are not.   Many ""average"" people believe so because of all of the recent stories regarding bad CEO's.  However, salary in a capitalistic society such as the USA's, is generally based on the value of the return of the position and what that particular person brings to that position, as well as the wealth of the company or organization to pay for that position.  Therefore as a CEO of a company, their ""value"" is extremely high and correspondingly must be paid for.   \n    Many people are upset at CEO's salary, however this is a function of the market economy in the society.   Many think CEO's salary should be less, but this would be contrary to the capitilistic market and would create ineffectual CEO's.  It would lesson the incentive to bring out the best to pursue the CEO position and as a result all positions in a company would be weakened and the company would fail.  Much like many organizations in so called Communist countries fail as their is no ""reward"" for being good - so why be good, why try - basic human nature.  If you work really hard, or are ""better"" than the rest but receive no reward you will not work hard at that task, but instead put your efforts elsewhere where you can achieve ""reward"".\n\nFinally there are many CEO's as individuals who are definitely overpaid.  Typically this is the result from knowing wealthy indviduals in positions of influence who do not have the expertise to judge if a person would be a good CEO or not, who place them in the position and pay them a ridculous salary."

well your sounds very vague... pls elaborate your question more to get specific answer... Are you looking to a specific IT company or any new IT company?
It depends. Some banks, instead of sending back your checks with every statement, send only copies of the checks, and this may include all checks deposited to the account.  If you go online and look at the statement, you can click on any line item on the statement and it will bring up an image of that item, front and back.  If Chase does that then yes, by going into the online statement and clicking on any item she will be able to see an image of that item.\n\nIf the deposit item in question is a check drawn on a local bank, you may be able to go to that bank and cash it, then take the cash and make a cash deposit into your joint checking account.  This way all your mom can see is a cash deposit.  if you don't even want her to see the cash, and need to pay some bills, take the cash and go to the post office and buy money orders for the amounts of the bills you need to pay, and send the money orders as payments.  This way, your mom will not see any deposit at all, or at most a very much reduced one.\n\nI used to do all this to keep it looking like I had no income and no deposits to my checking account.  Once I went to the post office and bought a total of $5,000 in a whole bunch of money orders, and only $300 or so actually made it as cash into my checking account.  For all intents and purposes if you looked at my checking account it looked like I was dead broke and in abject poverty.

"First, I'd suggest going to one of the credit bureaus websites and ordering a credit score. This will let you know where you stand as far as credit rating, which affects the interest rates available to you. It might be difficult not having much of a credit history to get an unsecured card, so I'd recommend finding a financial institution that offers a secured card. You secure the card by giving the bank money equal to the credit limit you want. They hold it for you in ""escrow"" so if you don't pay your bills, they withdraw the amount you didn't pay. \n\nInterest rate doesn't really matter if you pay off your balance each month, but its very easy to carry a balance and I speak from experience.

This is usually very difficult since any potential witnesses are typically other employees and have a lot to lose by testifying against their employer. Also, your company will mount a vigorous defense, so expect them to say awful things about your performance in court.

This might be a plausible role coming out of an engineering and management course.\n\nBoth Computing Business and International Business sound like good areas of study.  Could keep you in high-paying industries, but on the business end.  An example job could be in strategic planning for a software company, or business development even.  Your engineering background would give you an edge there.  Given what you've stated about yourself, I would probably go for one of those.
"""Tell me about yourself?""  is a very open question.  An interviewer is only trying to find out more about you.  Keep personal information to a minimun but use the question to bring up positive traits about yourself.  \n\n""Do you have any questions for me?""  gives you the opening to ask about things that are important to you.  Ask questions or they won't think that you have put much thought in to your search. \nWhat are your benefits?  What advancement opportunities are there?  How often do you evaluate an employee?  etc."
You have two options.\n1. Pace yourself. Spread out your work into the next day if possible.\n2. Volunteer. (NEVER DO THIS)\n\nHope that makes it an easy choice!

I use to work at Quicken Loans and worked leads.  Basically calling people that submitted info on websites such as getsmart.com or compareinterestrates.com.  Once of the biggest problems I had was overcoming the dis-trust.\n\nMy answer is simple:  research the company.  Ask if they have a website, then check them out through the state licensing board.  All lenders and brokers need a license to work in each state.  \n\nJust because a company is small doesn't mean they won't do a good job, though, so please keep that in mind.

I wouldn't advise doing this.  Send a thank you note for the interview, and if you don't get the position, then ask for feedback.
No, they cannot sue you if you're making an honest effort.

I think what you are saying is that because of the water claim the company is cancelling your insurance at the renewal on December 5th.    Call your agent and ask why it is being cancelled.  Was there other claims besides this claim?  When they inspected the building was it in good shape?  If the building is in bad shape the company may cancel due to the maintenance of the building.  There are numerous reasons why it could be cancelled.  Call your agent and find out why.\n\nThe company does have the right to cancel a policy at renewal so long as they comply with state laws and send a cancellation notice.
Dear Sir,I don't know in which country you live in,but overall the definitions are very the same.Of course,first you need to be signed in as an importer (see your government rules),then you specify the product:from which country,...then you get in touch with the exporter and ask for brochures,terms of delivery,prices,quality standards,....to find suppliers in Europe,you can search www.europages.com and look for products.Addresses are available on line. You can use search engines also (google,yahoo,...).Do not forget to ask important information about VAT,and all other costs involved (shipping,packaging,...).Look around for courses you can follow or get involved in on line business clubs, such as Linked In,Open BC,and so on.Ask your government for more information if necessary,or contact a lawyer specialized in export insurance. It's not easy,but you can open an on line store and sell without having a warehouse. Try it out,look for possibilities. I wish you luck.\nGreetings,\nLuc
Romance and erotic novels sell a lot. Then horror, adventure, suspense, mystery, detective, action and adventure rolled into one can be a good combination. Fiction related to history and psycholog also catch and attention. I think people are mad about diet and fitness these days and new parents read a lot about books on parenting. Children fairytale books with pictures are desirable and so are books that give good practical and handy ideas on how to make life better such as Housekeeping, Lifestyle, Beauty, Fashion, How to be Successful etc. I think for startes, such topics will be your safest bets.
I sincerely hope not!!
"Sounds like my case which is still going on. Look up the state statutes in your state and find the landlord/tenant rules. Most states say the landlord has to give a written list of deductions /damages with balance of security deposit within 30 days. If you have pics, that will help a lot. By most laws, if a request for a signed contract is stated, they must give you a copy. What I have done so far was went and bought the book ""Everybody's Guide to Small Claims Court."" In there is lists many facts that will help you. You will probably end up taking him to small claims court. If he did not give you a list of deductions and you fullfilled your tenancy requirements, the judge will rule in your favor. Make sure to send a couple of demand letters certified mail as well. Hope this helps."

"You are considered to be a sole proprietor, and will file a Schedule C with your personal income tax return (1040). IF you have no sales, but your intent is to produce income, you do still have a business. The IRS won't let this go on forever, but does understand that starting a business takes some time. \nYou certainly can deduct almost all of your expenses, however, some things can be deducted now, and some things must be depreciated, or taken over the expected life of the item. For instance, office supplies and utilities can be taken in one year, but buildings and equipment must usually be depreciated. What you can deduct and how it is deducted depends on what the business is, where it is located, and how it operates. I'll agree that you don't need an accountant, as long as you are keeping good records on your own. I do business taxes all the time for people who do their own books. I also own my own business (seperate from my tax job), and am familiar with deductions. \nOn the Schedule C, you'll need to show whatever sales you actually made, and then take your deductions from that in order to stay legal. The Sch.C has lines for all of that information, and I'll attach a copy, as well as instructions. Be aware: it is possible to have what is called a Net Operating Loss, allowing you negative income. This can be carried from one year to the next because you typically cannot take it all in one year. \nYou also need to be aware of the Schedule SE for what is called Self-Employment tax. This is the form that has you pay your Social Security and Medicare taxes which would otherwise be withheld form your paycheck. While you don't pay this tax if you have zero or negative income, you will eventually - 'cause your business is going to take off:)\nAlso, when you're looking at things you can deduct, keep in mind that you may have the ability to put money into an IRA, SEP, or SIMPLE plan, depending on your income and needs. Your contributions to these are generally deductible, and this helps you plan for your future as well. \nAnd now to defend myself. One of the other answerers suggested that you not go to an ""H&R Block or Jackson Hewitt type place"". I do not know what it takes to work at JH, so please don't take this as a slam on them. However, to work for H&R Block, you must be able to do a basic Schedule C and SE. To work for HRB for more than one year, you must take continuing education of at least 24 hours (going to 30 soon) in the off-season. I don't usually promote HRB on here, because I do work for them, but in this case, I'd hate to see you pay a lot to an accountant if you don't have to. Call ANY reputable tax preparation service and ask for someone who is knowledgable about Self-Employment. Talk to them about what you can and cannot deduct specific to your business. This information should be available to you at no charge (if someone wants to charge you for this, I'd leave and go elsewhere). And finally, tax preperation fees are indeed deductible for both individuals and businesses in different ways. So are any legal fees or professional association fees you may encounter. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. You can e-mail me through the Y! Answers site... keeps me accountable so that I'm not accused of trolling for clients, which I hope is not how this is taken :)"

Are you wanting to become a veterinary technician OR an assistant?  There is a HUGE difference.  The veterinary technician program Penn-Foster IS accredited by the AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association), which means that if you successfully completed the program with Penn-Foster, you could sit for the VTNE (Veterinary Technician National Exam) and a state board exam if your state offers it.  HOWEVER - I have spoken to several veterinarians that do not take degrees from these online courses as seriously, even if the person passed the board exams.  It is too easy for people to cheat on tests since most tests are taken at home, and you also do not get the quality of clinical laboratory experience that you'd get in a traditional classroom setting.  Also, many traditional programs for veterinary technicians and assistants require hands-on care of resident teaching animals.  And if you're in an online program, you don't get that extra experience of caring for the animals.  For those reasons, many veterinarians pass over vet tech / assistant applicants that have a degree from online schools.  NOT ALL of course, but many vets do feel this way.

"You probably need to think first about what PART of advertising you want to go into.  There are two main sides to any advertising agency.  The ""account side"" and the ""creative side"".  The account side is sales people, account managers, relationship managers, etc.  The creative side is designers, writers, editors, creative directors, all the typical video / film type people (directors, sound techs, etc), and those sorts.  Agencies also have the corporate business functions like accounting and HR, but that probably isn't what you're looking for.\n\nIf your interest is on the creative side, you probably want to look for specialty programs for the area you're looking for.  Develop your ""art"" at the same time you develop your knowledge of advertising.\n\nIf your interest is on the account side, then you want to probably look for a school with a program that will give you good advertising theory, but you'll also want to make sure you're getting steeped in ""business"" in general.  You need to know some about project management, accounting, finance, marketing, etc. - all the things ""business people"" are concerned with because those are the people you work with.\n\nIf you are interested in advertising, I would also suggest that you look into the different fields of ""marketing.""  It sounds like you're in high school so those two words may sound like they mean the same thing, but marketing is much more broad than advertising.  Marketers concern themselves with all decisions pertaining to the ""four P's"" - Product, Price, Place and Promotion.  Advertising falls into the promotion P but marketing people also deal with pricing studies, product attributes and development, portfolio mixes, marketing research, etc.  A marketing person is the one who might decide, for instance, that in order to maximize profits for a brand, the price needs to be higher.  But in order to increase the price, the image may need to be brougt more upscale than it currently is.  So they'll work with the packaging people to make nicer packaging, they may work with product development to add features or other value, and they'll tell the advertising agency what the objective is for the advertising needed.  The agency then goes and develops ads that, hopefully, will do what is needed.\n\nMarketing and advertising are far more complex than they seem at first because at the end of the day, there is big money and serious business involved.  But they're exhilerating, exciting fields also.\n\nBTW, there is very little advertising happening in Vermont.  Some, but not much.  If you're looking to build a big career in advertising, you're most likely going to need to do it in a large city, and if your career clicks and you really start moving and shaking, you'll have to be in a major market like New York or Chicago.\n\nGood luck!"

I am in insurance agent and the company I work for specializes in Life and Health... In my honest opinion I would recomend that you consider getting some kind of insurance to pay off your mortage if you die and something to cover you funeral.  Term insurnace is good for your mortage (select a term lenght that is as long as your mortage ie. 10 or 20 yrs and an amount that is the cost of you mortage)  The coverage ends at then end of your term and you get nothing back but you have the peice of mind that if you die your loved ones dont have to sell your house for less than what it is worth.  A small whole life is good for funeral expenses and with whole life you pay a little more but you can have it forever and if you ever get into a financial bind you can borrow from it usually 10 or 15k is enough for a funeral depending on where you live.

Yes they can and yes they suck for doing this, but, that's the sorry state of health care in our country today.\n\nCall your doctor, explain the situation, and ask him/her to help you fill out the forms that you can download and print out from the web site for the Partnership for Prescription Assistance. This organization is a godsend. They are a liasion between you, your doctor, and the pharmaceutical company that makes your medication, and, in many cases, can help you get your meds at little to no cost. They helped me get my migraine medication - Imitrex - when my insurance ran out, for free, which saved my life because the doses cost $30 each and it was way out of my league to pay for out of pocket. You have to do the initial legwork on getting the forms, but, your doctor should be able to step up to the plate and help you out while waiting for the approvals, by providing you with samples, which they get for free from pharmaceutical salespeople. My doctor had a drawer full, I kid you not, and was able to give me a few to tide me over. Be assertive, be thorough, be diligent, and don't give up. DO NOT GO BACK ON THE USELESS NARCOTICS. You will only do yourself more harm than good, as you already know. You have to be your own advocate here, as no one in our current government is gonna speak up for you. Don't forget to vote on Tuesday, against every single incumbant who has failed to make affordable health care a reality for us average Americans.

"closing out credit card (any revolving charge accounts) will help your FICO in the long run.  but short term, one factor that weighs into your FICO is the ""percentage of revolving usage"".  this is the percent of balances to credit limits.  the lower this percentage is, the better.\n\nfor instance: you owe $5,000 total on the cards, and have $10,000 credit limits on them.  your usage is 50%.  but if you have $5,000 in balances and $20,000 in limits (i.e. you don't close out the cards you don't use), your usage is 25%.  lower percentage = better credit score.\n\nif you don't carry high balances though, its best just to close them out and be done with them."

She probably had a probate attorney when your father passed, or at least someone who handled his will.  Transferring property for $1.00 could trigger massive gift taxes, among other things.  Simply doing a quit claim deed, putting the title from Mom to Mom and You could do the trick.  You'll likely also need to file the affidavit of survivorship and death certificate to remove your father.\n\nIf there was no attorney involvement when your father passed, find a real estate attorney or title company in your area.  Title companies will be cheaper, but may not be able to offer legal advice, depending on the company.  Get professional advice so you can avoid IRS complications, and to make sure the deeds are accurate.\n\nIt's possible that adding you to the title could change your cost basis when your mother passes, versus simply inheriting it.\n\nPaying $500 for an attorney could save you tens of thousands in taxes for goofing it up.
"As to your first question, generally yes, the sale of this property will ""wipe out"" all other creditors. The exception would be if something wasn't found on the report that they use (typically the attorney who is handling the foreclosure orders a report that ""guarantees"" the sale). The attorneys use this report to make sure that everyone has been notified. That's also why they are required to ""post"" the sale in conspicuous places. So, I would recommend getting a title search to see what is in fact out there on this property.\n\nAs to the second question, that's the hard part about buying from a foreclosure or seizure. The lender takes time to do all of it's stuff (underwriting, appraisals, etc), and normally you don't have a lot of time before the sale. I'd suggest talking to your bank or your local mortgage consultants. Tell them exactly what you want to do, and they'll tell you whether or not they can help. Hopefully, you'll find one that can, but it won't be easy. Typically at a foreclosure/seizure/sheriff's sale, you need to have the money within moments of having the winning bid. Okay, that part isn't so bad, but what if there are other people bidding against you? It doesn't happen often (in my 5 years of this, I never saw it happen and only heard of it once), but it can happen. \n\nI hope all of this helps out. Good luck, I hope you get it and that it's in immaculate shape!"

First, you made the right decision by not taking the escrow account. This is really an interest free loan that you make to the bank.\nThe taxing authority determines whether you must pay all at once or in installments. Usually, there is a discount for paying all at once, which of course is the pro to paying all at once.\nHowever, if your taxes are really high, then paying them quarterly might be better, since you could hold onto more of your money and invest it. You would have to perform a cost/benefit analysis, but generally this would be possible on really expensive real estate with high property taxes.

It also includes the study of existing drugs, their biological properties, and their quantitative structure-activity relationships. \nOrganic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and reactions of organic compounds. \nPhysical chemistry is the study of the physical fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, electrochemistry,quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and spectroscopy. Physical chemistry has large overlap with theoretical chemistry and molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of calculus in deriving equations. \nTheoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is called quantum chemistry. Since the end of the second world war, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with condensed matter physics and molecular physics.See Reductionism.

reliance money franchisee. He says that the Rs.12 per transaction is charged only for non internet transactions, where the clients go to the brokers office and trade. For transaction done thro internet this 12 rs. does not apply. The 500 rs. prepaid coupon will allow an intraday volume of 1 crore.\n\nReliance strategy is to gain max. marketshare within few months of launching. There is gonna be a big price war in the near future. It can only get better for investors, from here on. \n\nReliance money does not have an account with RBI.\nFor Rs 500 one can get trading worth Rs 1.00 Cr.\nNow what it will cost to Reliance Money:\nRM has to pay Rs 400 per Cr to NSE as transaction charges a part of which which goes into Settlement Guarantee Fund. RM has to pay Rs 20 per cr to SEBI.\nI am not clear weather this includes STT ,State stamp Duty & Service tax.\nWhat about Demat Charges ? What they are going to charge is not available.\nLets deem that this is not included.\nNow this leaves Rs 80 per cr with Reliance Money.\n\nCan they survive with this amount ?\nWhat innocent investors are not understanding is that these are tactics to attract investors from their traditional brokers & later raise their tariff.\n\nReliance communication is master in this. They recently have a card costing Rs 180 by which U can send 18,000 SMS. When U are hooked to SMS, they suddenly withdraw this coupon.\n\nPlease ask your franchisee friend can they guarantee this tariff for 3 years ?\nThey cannot !\nFurther with one card you cannot sell or buy even in your wife's account.\n\nNow if U have 4 demat  account in your family, you have to spend rs 2000/- on buying 4 cards. Can U trade Rs 4 Cr in one month.\n\nLastly Reliance Money is at par with all the brokers as far as charges are concerned.\nThis is courtsey SEBI who levied uniform fee of Rs 20 per crore on all, recently,  instead of .01% for new broker for first 5 years & only Rs 5000 for 5 years thereafter irrespective of volume. THis is same fees for which two years back brokers have to cough up more than Rs 500 Cr to SEBI after they lost a case in Supreme court.

Investors look first at the people involved in the company. If you are just starting out and don’t have relevant experience, investors expect to see that you have an experienced team of advisors and employees helping you in the business. \n\n- Make sure you “sell” the one reason your business will become profitable. \n\n- State clearly the strategies you will employ to get the word out about your business. Your business plan must show how you will leverage the Internet, public relations, viral marketing, and other strategies to attract customers. \n\n- Present realistic estimates of the time, energy and costs of building a successful business. Do not underestimate or overestimate revenues. While investors know your numbers are simply guesses, they want to see that your numbers are within the “range of reality.” Be careful of your financial statements: this is one area where you can easily lose credibility if presented poorly. \n\n- Benchmark similar companies to show that you’ve done your homework and researched the market. \n\n- Your Executive Summary is your calling card. If it is not a winner, investors may not even read your entire plan. Emphasize your own as well as your team’s track record in the Executive Summary. \n\n- Before sending your business plan to lenders and investors, send it out first to a few in order to get feedback. You’d want to correct your plan if someone tells you that you’re way off mark, rather than have a potential investor tell it to you and lose the chance to get the funding you need.
First, go back to the place you filed that tax return. They are required to keep in their records a copy of your tax return up to 3 years.  Next, if for some reason they don't have it, you need to contact the IRS.\n\nGo to the link provided, they explain everything in detail.
If you got your position thru a temp agency, talk with them first.\nWait at least a month after going permanent, to ask for a raise-$ 2.75 dont ask for the whole $3 .  And in that month, be building a good rapport with your manager and h.r. person. Never mention what the receptionist makes because in a sense, she is the face of the company when people walk in the door or call on the phone.(trust me) Also, no matter how upset you get, never let anyone at work know it because people can have big mouths especially in a corporate setting. Keep your cool never let them see you sweat and if you are mad about anything, especially what someone else is making or the work load, express your feelings only outside of work.
Hi. CTC as the name suggests is your total cost to company when you are employed. It means every single rupee the company spends on you is accounted here, including stututary obligations like the company's contribution to your PF and gratuity etc. Obviously cash in hand will be much lower. Whether 60-70% depends on what are the components of your CTC. The higher you grow up the corporate ladder the fringe benefits keep growing but the take home will not keep pace at the same rate. Some components of your CTC do attract fringe benefit tax.

Congratulations on your promotion! \n\nYour goal is to motivate your employees to accomplish the goals of the organization.\n\nBe supportive and encouraging of your employees. You are the team leader and make sure that you show them that you are willing and able to help them, especially when it's busy. Always remember what it's like to be an entry level employee so you don't forget what motivated you.\n\nEncourage your employees to do their best. When they screw up, don't yell! Instead, calmly talk to them and help them to learn how to stop making the mistakes. \n\nRemember that in training it's not just explaining it, but ensuring that the employee UNDERSTANDS what to do. People learn best by doing, rather than just being told. So show them and carefully explain, then watch them to make sure they understand.\n\nPraise the good work they do. Recognize the people when they do something to take care of the customer. Commend an employee when they go out of their way to gain customer satisfaction.\n\nDo NOT belittle an employee, and don't gossip. As a fast food manager, you want the employees to work together as a team. \n\nEach day, try to remember something the employees did well and commend them for doing that.\n\nBe approachable to the employees and you will build their trust.\n\nThe best supervisor I ever had would come up and tell me that he  appreciated my work and was glad that I was working for him. Then he would ask me how I liked my job and there was anything he could do to make my job easier or if I was having problems with anything. You know what, he had the employees going out of their way to make sure he was happy.\n\nDon't hide information from them. It ticks me off when I'm told to do something but not given information WHY I'm doing something. \n\nCredibility is important. Walk the walk. Maintain integrity with them. If you promise them something, deliver onthat promise or explain to them why you cannot deliver what you promised.\n\nThere will be those problem employees that are not motivated to work - they are there only for a paycheck or to socialize with their friends. I'd recommend doing a search on motivational strategies. \n\nGood luck to you! If you are asking questions like this, it sounds like you are definitely trying to make a good impression. And you know what? A person who makes an effort deserves the benefit of the doubt. Just remember to stay focused on your goals. If you keep a positive, can do attitude, you will do very well.\n\nCongratulations and best wishes on your future!

Used to work in the corporate retail world...you're going to have to contact Mervyn's corp which is in Pleasanton, CA (bay area) and speak with them.  Corporate is the one that determines what the stores sell and the set up of the stores...etc.  Going to the store directly will not do anything because they don't have the authority to say yes or no in terms of carrying your product.  Mervyn's is also Target Corp.  One thing that u might want to think about too is that you're prob going to have to be able to provide enough quantity to all Mervyn's stores if you want them to carry your products.

"Always talk positive about yourself- even when they ask you ""What do you feel is your biggest weakness as a worker?"" Questions like these are designed to trip you up.  They're looking to see that you have a positive image of yourself.  Turn a potential weakness and make it sound good.  I use something like ""My determination to get things right... "" as a weakness.  Also they might ask you what you disliked (and liked) about your last job.  Turn a dislike into something positive, never ever talk negative about an employer, even if you hated the job. This site helped me, hope it can help you out too :]  Good luck!!"
"""As is"" means don't ask the seller to make improvements.  For example, a normal house for sale may have old worn carpet.  The buyer can negotiate the seller to replace the carpet OR give the buyer a credit for the price of replacing the carpet.  In normal house sales, negotiations like this take place all the time.\n\nWith an ""as is"" property, the seller is full aware of the things wrong with the house and they do not intend to fix them.  They can be minor things like worn carpet or old paint, but they can also be major things like an old roof or substandard plumbing.  They don't want you to go into the offer expecting to negotiate.  Does that make sense?"
"if you buy items for a business, you can claim they are a ""business expense"" and deduct them from your gross income when you pay your taxes.  so, you only pay taxes on a smaller amount of income.  for personal expenses, you can write off the interest on your mortgage, and a bunch of other thigns that I don't know about since i am not an accountant... but even things like moving expenses can apparently be written off your annual gross income... so then you only pay taxes on a small portion of this."

What you do with the proceeds of a loan once you get it is totally up to you.
This is a mortgage question.\n\nAn ARM refers to your loan term and is defined as ADJSUTABLE RATE MORTGAGE. It indicates that the loan's rate is not fixed and can change. the rate art which it changes depends on the type of loan. Some have short term fixed periods and then convert to adjustable. \n\nThere is a right and a wrong time for these. As a general rule, these are for short term options...5 years or less. Meaning, if you think you will move or want to refinance, or could have a better credit position in less than 5 years...then an ARM makes sense.\n\nI write a blog on the subject of credit management, mortgages, real estate trends, etc. Check it out for more information that may be helpful.

"how about selling stuff?  you can ask your parents to loan you some money to buy whit t-shirts that you can design yourself and sell at a higher price than what you bought the shirts for.\n\nor how about selling baked foods?  you can bake pies or brownies and things like that and put them in boxes and sell them this christmas.\n\nyou can also try babysitting, or get a newspaper route or mowing other people's lawns.  you can also offer to clean other people's houses. some people might need their dogs walked. you could be a dog walker.\n\nyou can also try to find out if you have any local business clubs that could help you find out if there are any companies that take in interns who are under 18.  sometimes they may not pay you, but you could get a lot of exposure and training to the ""real world"" of business.\n\nyou can also ask permission from your parents if you can sell stuff on ebay.  you can sell your old clothes, books, dolls, toys, etc.\n\ntry also asking your local boys and girls club or ymca/ywca if they might have any jobs for young women like you who are under 18.\n\njust be sure that you ask your parents for permission first before you go out exploring.  people might take advantage of you since you're still young, so be sure nobody fools or tricks you."
The question is very vague -- we're not given any information about what Bob's marital status (or rather whether he is withholding at a married or single rate) \n\nat 900 a week, he takes home $46800 annually.  6.2% of his 65k salary goes to Social Security ($4030) and 1.45% goes to Medicare (942.50).  $60027.50 left before figuring his tax percentage, which works out at 22% (but that's not a correct figure, as it doesn't figure in state taxes, personal exemption, and standard deduction)

"Wow, didn't know people posted homework questions on here.\n\nI'll be nice and help.\n\n1st transaction their is no tax effect for the 700, but the 300 shares have a $900 short term loss.  The other 700 falls under the ""wash sale"" rule of the IRS, and his basis remains the same as the original transaction (IE, 700 shares has a purchase basis of $19,600 (700*$28 original price per stock)\n\n2nd Short term capital gain of $6,000.  No releveance to the first transaction since the stocks are from different entitied.  He offsets the loss to the gain for a net gain of $5,100\n\n3rd.  Basis due to wash shale is $19,600.  He captures the loss of the difference (19,600-15,500) leading to a loss of 4,100.  Combine this with the other short term loss of $900, you have a total loss of $5,000.  Of this, only $3,000 short term capital losses may be claimed, and the other $2,000 is carrier over to the next year."

An artist in residence is paid to work at an organization (university, corporation, government), and generally produces art work while there, with an expectation this be done with the participation of students / staff / citizens.

They are to be postmarked no later than Jan. 31st, 2007. \nRemember, just because they are postmarked doesn't mean they will be sent out right away. Some companies are like that, i suppose.\nAlso, if you have moved, be sure to notify your employers of the new address. Many times it will cause a delay in receiving all the paperwork to file your taxes, especially if it was a place that you haven't worked for since the beginning of the year.
"Lady_Chris is correct.  Bankruptcy is federal law.  While some portions of the process etc vary from state to state - the bulk of it is the same regardless of where it was filed.\n\nYou will have to have the approval of the trustee to obtain ANY new debt until your chapter 13 is completely over.\n\nThe validity of any debt made during this time is very questionable.  And VERY frowned upon by the attorney, the trustee and the bankruptcy court & judge.  Even a secured credit card as someone mentioned.  The thought process I believe leans toward ""if you can take on another debt - you could instead be paying more on the chapter 13 plan"".  That would certainly be my argument should I have a customer in a chapter 13 that obtained a new debt without approval.  Not a smart thing to do (without trustee approval).\n\nTalk to your attorney should you be interested in pursuing.  Time frames vary from place to place - but here the norm is that it might take a few months to get an answer back to your request to take on another debt.\n\nThe Chapter 13 stays on your credit report I believe for 10 years now, while a chapter 7 stays for only 7 ( I think ).  \n\nIf your attorney is not providing the advice / service you need - you can call the trustee directly and ask about having a different attorney assigned to you (might be added cost).  There have been times I have seen customers change attornies for one reason or another.\n\nGood luck."

What time frame are you looking at? The higher the risk the more profitable the return but at the same time the more chance of losing your money.  The more legal your investment the less profitable too.  Investment in Caribbean countries are paying good money right now.  If you are young and want to take on a decent amount of risk. I would invest in financial commodities Euros to be exact. in commodities you can control a 200:1 ratio with your $5000 you can control $1000000 US worth of Euros as the Euro will rise you keep the profits when you think it high enough say $15000000 sell and pay back the 1000000 and pay you broker and keep your nice profit of roughly $450000 US.  Believe me when I say the Euro is going to rise against the dollar this year especially with the economy about to tank thanks to our election results. Iraqis about to boil over the Middle East is abut to ignite and Europe is the only stable continent.

How long have you been in the business, personally  I think going back to work for someone after self employment and being your own Boss, is a step backwards.  If the business is not producing what you expected, then you need to examine the reasons for this rather than throw in the towel and go and work for a fixed income employer, whom will govern your whole life and time and basically everything you do until you retire. \n\nYou must have been pretty unhappy to have bought the business in the first place and quit your last job, so why return to the same street you left ?  Look at that business and all thats wrong with it and put those things right first. If  it was all a big mistake and you are really not at all cut out for business ownership, then do return to being an employee! Good luck.
They will contact you at the phone number on your application to make sure that the transaction is OK.You could phone the company on the number on the bill or that came with your card this will be much quicker.

"In answer to your questions:\n\n1 - It will depend on what address you gave to Google Adsense when you applied. If it is outside of US, and the payment are sent to outside of US, then you will not have to pay for the taxes. If you registered with Adsense a US address, then Google Adsense will send you a 1099 -- which is also sent and reported to IRS. So you will have to pay for taxes on that income, even if you stayed outside of the US.\n\nTo make sure that you are not taxed, go to your Adsense account and go to Tax Information page. There is what is called Certification of No U.S. Activities -- fill up that form and submit to Adsense to make sure that you will not be taxed when you are outside of the US.\n\nHere's the content of that form:\n\n--------------------------------------------\nPlease sign and testify to the following information. By clicking Submit information you agree that: \n\nPublisher represents and warrants that it does not have any employees or equipment located in the United States (""U.S. Activities"") that are involved in any way with the revenue that has been or will be earned by Publisher pursuant to the Google AdSense Online Program.

You have a couple of avenues:\n\nSomeone recommended that you contact an attorney.  This will cost you at least $200 for an initial consultation.  Then probably $1,000 or so for retainer. If you have the money and the debt truly is not yours, then I would fight it.\n\nIf the debt is yours, or you can not prove that it is not, then I would contact the collection agency and settle before court.  The collection will only be on your credit another 3 years, but the judgement will stay on for much longer, maybe 10 years.  Plus you will incur court costs if you do not settle now.\n\nHopefully this helps.  Good luck.
Custodian as a financial term, refers to a bank (Custodian bank), agent, or other organization responsible for safeguarding a firm's or individual's financial assets. The role of a custodian in such a case would be the following: to hold in safekeeping assets such as equities and bonds, arrange settlement of any purchases and sales of such securities, collect information on and income from such assets (dividends in the case of equities and interest in the case of bonds), provide information on the underlying companies and their annual general meetings, manage cash transactions, perform foreign exchange transactions where required and provide regular reporting on all their activities to their clients. \nCustodian banks are often referred to as Global Custodians if they hold assets for their clients in multiple jurisdictions around the world, using their own local branches or other local custodian banks in each market to hold accounts for their underlying clients. Assets held in such a manner are typically owned by pension funds.

"At this point, I would argue that it is valuable because it is a traditional holdover from 5000 years ago or more.  The neat thing about gold is that it has historically had the same basic purchasing power.  In ancient Egypt several thousand years ago, a one ounce gold coin would buy a nice suit of clothes - same today.  Also, for centuries, gold was the ""common currency"" around most of the world.  Even if your coin had the image of the ""wrong"" emperor on it, it could be melted down and re-cast for similar value.  Many central banks settled nations' debts in gold until ""recently"".  Most went off the gold standard between WWII and the early 1970's.\n\nInvestors still ""flee to gold"" when they feel there will be high inflation in the near future, Gold is used in some tech products (CRT computer monitors for example) and some Central Banks still maintain gold reserves - hence the majority of its value as an investment today.\n\nHope this helps."

The first thing you need to do is contact all of your creditors and see if you can work out a payment schedule. Make sure you can stick with any arrangements. You can often work out a settlement for less than is owed. Once you have these balances cleared, you should see your credit score rise. While you are clearing your credit you should start saving money for a down payment on a house. It takes time to rebuild your credit. Don't get discouraged. You can do it.
For eight months?! That is crazy. Write a letter to the Human Resources director with a Copy to the CEO and CFO and your direct supervisor. Include copies of all your paychecks and give them until next pay check to get all your money back. And ask tell them that since you hae been such a good sport about this, yo hope they return the favor and pay you some interest on the money. If you had had this cash in your savings account how much more would you have now? They screwed up, they need to pay up. Furthermore, if you are the only one having this problem tell them that you feel singled out and that this has affected your morale. The whole administration owes you an apology. If thext pay check is not a fat one, start calling an employment law attorney.

What i like about having money is the ability to leave an extra large tip to an overworked waitress, hire the neighbor that couldn't find a job so he wouldn't loose his home (I now have enough firewood to heat a small city) and many other things.

Amt effects higher income taxpayers, meaning at this time $90,000 and above. This has to be in combination with high deductions for taxes (real estate and income) and high miscellaneous deductions.\nCapital gains don't affect AMT as you get the 15% tax rate on both the regular tax and the AMT tax. The problem here is that you would pay state income tax on the gain so you would need to see the effect of this payment on AMT. You should run the tax numbers to see which year to pay the state tax on the gain, or how much to pay this year and how much to pay with the return next year.\nIf you had 15 or more personal exemptions you could also run up against the AMT. \nA spouse could cause a problem because your more income would cause more state income tax withholding that could cause AMT.

Sorry to hear of your problems with Insurance.\n\nMost UK policies will provide cover for damage caused by escape of water (eg a leak).\n\nThe Insurance will pay for the cost to repair the damaged caused by the leak (eg water damage to carpet etc) - It will not repair the leak itself.\n\nThis would be the same situation with Liverpool Victoria.\n\nThe same applies to your fridge breakdown - Your home Insurance policy will pay to replace the damaged food caused by the breakdowm, but it will not replace or repair the fridge.\n\nThere are seperate Insurance policies available to cover the breakdown of white goods in your home (eg, fridge, freezer, washing machine etc), but these are expensive and will only provide cover if the items are less that 2 or 3 years old - This means the more your need it (because your white goods are getting older and more likely to brekadown), the less likely they will insure you.\n\nI'm not sure you will get any insurance to cover you for the cost of repairing a leak - try you Water Company, as sometimes they have a policy which will pay for one of their engineers to come out and fix the problem - but I think it is expensive for what you get.\n\nWith regards to the best Home Insurance company in the UK, I suggest you speak to a local Insurance Broker - Cheap isn't always the best.  I would recommend you make sure any quotation includes Accidental Damage as a minimum.  You may also want to opt for cover outside your home (eg jewellery, bikes, camera equipment etc) - but this will cost extra.\n\nGood luck with your search.....

"THE RIGHT RESUME – THE FIRST STEP TO ANY DREAM CAREER\n\nIt could be a piece of paper or a word file but a resume is a lot more. It is a definitive statement, which provides the observer a clue and insight into the person behind it. And hence allow him or her to make necessary judgment about the candidate’s suitability for a particular position. The other perspective is that in a ultra competitive scenario like the one today, the resume is among the crucial barometers of differentiation or competitive edge that a aspirant can gain. Having stressed on the importance of your resume to your career, allow us to provide you with some valuable tips regarding the same.\n\nBefore we do that, do remember that the recruiters know that most candidates will not meet all their requirements, so they do accept candidates who do not meet all the requirements\n\nWith few simple guidelines you can craft your resume.\n\nDo’s and Don’ts\nBe factual: Be factual and mention all your accomplishments. However, do not lie or exaggerate the same.\n\nBe professional: Resume should be easy to read and professional looking. Avoid any typing and grammatical mistakes. Do not over format your resume like fonts in bold or italics, underlines and different fonts etc. Use Arial font in 11-12 point size. Use either bold or underline to highlight specific details, but don’t use both. Make sure you have indented it properly.\n\nBe focused: Your resume should be brief, about 1 to 2 pages. Recruiters prefer the precise resumes rather than long ones. Do not include your salary expectations, references, certificates and training details unless it is asked for.\n\nBe unique: Use your resume to target specific jobs. Avoid sending resumes to many companies.

"The bad check would be my biggest worry, it is possible that a warrant for your arrest was issued, depending on local/state laws. Which could still be outstanding, I would definitely check, I'd hate to get pulled over for a minor traffic violation or check check upon reentry by customs and find out I had an outstanding warrant for my arrest, even though the charges are minor and would probably only involve paying a fine and/or monies owed, it would be a BIG hassle. I'd check on it and clear it up BEFORE my return, if I were you.\n\nExperian is one of the BIG 3 credit reporting agencies along with Trans-Union and Equifaq. You should check all 3 to get an accurate picture of your credit in the US. Also credit scores are available from all 3 (which will vary up to 40 points from place to place) and the average score is 675. Anything 675 and up you should have no problem with getting a credit card, bank account, etc. \n\nOh one more place to check is Chex Systems, they are kind of like a credit reporting agency except the keep records of people who have accounts closed at banks due to overdrafts and similar situations. Many Large and Local banks will not open an account for you if you have been reported to chex systems, although a quick internet search of ""Bank account NO chex systems"" will return several internet banks that will open account (usually with less favorable terms and higher fee's) even if you have been reported to chex.\n\nIn my opinion most of these problems would have disappeared after 11 years, long ago written off, execpt for the bad check.\n\nGood luck."

"Seems to me that, at the start, you could just buy the ribbons directly at wholesale price and pay any tariffs when the ribbons come in via the USPS or UPS or whatever.  \n\nFrom the website noted:\n""Do I Need an Import License?: For general merchandise (those items not specifically regulated by another agency), importers may file Customs entries for their own account without applying for an import license and without the use of a Customs Broker. This is often the case when receiving a package via the US Mail from overseas, or travelers returning from business abroad.""\n\n\nSince import taxes are Federal, the state of New York should have nothing to do with it.  \n\nI would recommend that you start up on EBay.  Do some research as to what type of ribbon sales are already out there.  Do you want to sell by the bolt?  By the yard?  \n\nAlso you should have an on line store that can be reached without ebay.  There are services out there that make it easy for you.  You can register this store in on line malls.\n\nGood luck!

First, some surveys pay high, but what is high?  do you consider $15 dollars a high pay for doing nothing but sitting on your butt?  maybe....so, what do you have to do for 15 dollars?  maybe answer a survey that takes like 3 hours.....see how they get you?  or sometimes you have to qualify for the survey...so they ask you  qualifying questions first...and if you qualify, they give you the survey..if not then forget it.....and it costed you time to look and then you dont get it alot of times...reason is because they need a certain ""strain"" of people to get an exact opinion to complete their requirement sensitive surveys....and sometimes they dont pay you right away...and other times you need to get at least 20 dollars before they issue you a check..and if you get to the 20...then the money sits there until you get enough...all the while...the money they owe you is sitting in the bank...collecting interest to the point where it will cost them nothing to get you to do some of their surveys....i have tried it...i have to be honest and say that i didnt try it all..but i tried a couple of them and i know enough that the pay per hour is extremely low compared to just regular jobs....i would rather spend 5 dollars for gas to go to work for 10 buxx an hour for 2 hours.....at least i know i make 15 buxx....other there..some people make out if they have alot of time on hand...but for the most part...nobody has that kind of time..and even if they make out..i dont think its anywhere close to a job that supports you on ramen noodles...."

MR = MC\nA firm’s profit is defined as its total revenue minus its total cost. In symbols, p (Q) = R(Q) - C(Q). A firm that wishes to maximize its profits may find the corresponding output by differentiating p (Q) with respect to output and finding the output that equates the derivative to zero:\ndp (Q)/dQ = dR(Q)/dQ - dC(Q)/dQ = MR - MC = 0. That is, profit maximization requires that, if the firm chooses to produce anything at all, it should equate marginal revenue and marginal cost. In the specific case of competitive firms, this takes the form P = MC. The second-order condition is:\n -  < 0, or that marginal revenue cuts marginal cost from below.\nHowever, we know that the maximum found by the procedure above is only a local maximum. We also need to check that the output at the beginning of the range of possible output does not provide greater profits. Specifically, we need to check profits where output is zero. If output is zero, then revenue is zero, variable cost is zero, and profit equals p (0) = 0 - (FC + 0); the firm loses an amount equal to its fixed costs. Naturally, then, the firm would only select this option if its losses at the MR = MC output were greater than this. Let Q* be the output that satisfies the MR = MC rule. Total profits at this point will be p (Q*) = PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)). Profits at Q = 0 will be higher than at Q = Q* if and only if p (0) = -FC > PQ* - (FC + VC(Q*)) = p (Q*). Dividing both sides of this inequality by Q* and rearranging, the firm maximizes profit at Q = 0 if and only if P <  , that is, if and only if the firm’s price is less than its average variable cost at the MR = MC output. Since average variable cost is equal to marginal cost at the former’s minimum, we can state the complete short-run profit-maximizing rule as follows: produce at the output for which MR = MC, provided price is greater than minimum average variable cost; otherwise shut down.

"http://www.turnkeyhedgefunds.com/about_hedge_funds.htm\n""Hedge Funds"" are often referred to as ""alternate investment vehicles"" and are tailored to the needs of sophisticated, high net worth private investors. A Hedge Fund is generally structured as a limited partnership having a general partner responsible for the investment activities and day-to-day operation of the fund, and limited partners who are the investors supplying capital but not participating in trading or operations of the fund. The limited partners have limited liability. That is, their exposure to loss is limited to their investment. The General Partner has unlimited liability and is liable for the activities of the partnership. The General Partners principals limit their liability through the use of a corporation or limited liability company as the General Partner. (Of course, the principals cannot limit their liability from the application of the anti fraud provisions of the Federal Securities Laws.) All of the investors’ capital is pooled and is utilized by the General Partner or Investment Manager to implement its trading or investment strategy."
"""Is a verbal threat a just cause for eviction?""   \n\nA threat of physical harm?  Absolutely, yes.  \n\nBut ... in order for your landlord to cover his butt and be able to take action, you will need to file a complaint in municipal court against the roommate and pursue it.  Anyone can just go and make a report, be it true or false.  A serious person also files a complaint and follows through with it in municipal court.\n\nOnce you do that, your landlord will have the grounds he needs as far as cause goes.  Where I live, a threat of physical harm goes on a 3 day notice to quit and you can file for eviction three days after the person has been served."

I am a bit.  I really sympathise with the people that saved with Farepak, but the reality is it is just for Christmas.  There are people far worse off - what about the Farepak staff that have lost their jobs not just their Christmas savings?  Why is no one talking about them.  What about thepeople who work for companies that collapse and lose their pensions too?  That affects their whole life - not what is essentially one day.  I had saved some money for Christmas and a stupid woman crashed into our car (without insurance) so it has cost us a small fortune and our no claims and then my cat broke his leg and that cost £800.  Christmas will be very low key for us (it usually is!)  At the end of the day, I have my health and so do my family and we'll be together at Christmas and  that's what is important - not a huge pile of presents.

Basically meaning that it would take $49.81 Philippine Pesos to equal $1.00 US Dollar. \n\nSo the current economic value of the money that you have will not be too hefty. If it is a coin, and it says 2 centavos, then that is equal to 2 one hundredths of one Piso. \n\nAlternatively, the coin could have some value as a collector's item, as the coin increases in age. But in order for the coin to increase in value, you must preserve it, and keep it in good condition. \n\nHowever, due to the volatile economic and political conditions in the Philippines, the coin may not increase in value for quite awhile. \n\nHope this helps!\n\n-A.R.

"There are all kinds:\n\n1/ Tax rebates - they kind of defer taxes for a certain period provided certain conditions are satisfied. These are usually given in areas that are under-served e.g. need to attract business and so forth. The developer gets a kind of deferment on the tax rate and pays a discounted rate. In some markets, the localities oferred rebates for new single-family housing. In Cleveland, for example, the county tried to gentrify some low-income areas by oferring rebates on new SFR construction.\n\n2/ Tax credits - very popular with multi-family properties where the developer is given an incentive to build a new apt complex and lease below market as low-income housing for a certain period. Once the period lapses (say 10 years), the developer can raise rents and lease at market rate. At which point, the developer gets a tax credit that is sometimes used ""as cash"" (i.e. syndication) to raise capital for new/other real estate projects the developer may have on the books. The loophole in the law allowing for syndication will probably be closed by Congress (if they have not done so already) since it creates a myriad of problems from the developer and county angles.\n\nThere are so many other kinds but these are the 2 that I have encountered on more than one occassion."

When you walk into the dealership the financing agent will try to spam you with high APR and for sure be able to come up with some faults ( not long enough job history, first big loan...all crap) Try to consult your local bank first. Current APR with 700+ FICO and no delinquency should not be greater than 7% at any cost.
Agency cost theory is in Finance, not in Accounting. It was the work of Jensen and Merckel two Stanford professors. Since managers are considered as Agents of the Stock holders, they pronounced that by giving them incentives for exemplary work done can motivate them to  perform better. Probably they didn't mean harm at that time but it lead to wide spread stock rigging and Accounting scandals which culminated in the debacle of Fortune 500 companies like Enron, World crossing etc;

I'd recommend holding off on the stocks until you build some diversification with your investments.  Try to build a nest egg of about $20K in mutual funds... trust me, you'll sleep better at night and not worry about a single stock plummeting on you.  Once you have that foundation of mutual funds, invest in one stock at a time... perhaps a $2000 total investment per purchase.  Buy three stocks... that's $6,000 total, etc.  Whatever numbers you decide are best for you, start with a solid foundation of mutual funds.... because here's the fun part: as you buy individual stocks as I suggested, eventually you'll own 50 stocks or more... that's your own mini-mutual fund that you've created!  Be sure your stocks are diversified... don't put all your money into stocks in the same industry.  Spread your money around... you'll be glad you did.  Good luck.

no and neither are violent video games or any of that other crap that some poeple say are corrupting us. kids will be exposed to things sooner or later. might as well teach them while their young, so that they know what is and what isnt bad and know how to be responsable in using that knowlage. if you tell a kid that pot is bad at age 5 he's less likely to try it. tell him at age 13 and chances are he already knows about it, has tried it, and since he's actually tried it and experienced it for himself he may decide whether or not he likes it. we should expose our kids to what really goes on, not lie to them and pretend that this world is such a lovely place... when its the opposite. i would say no advertising doesnt affect our youth, atleast not in a bad way. all it does is make us want things. expose your child so he knows whats out there, and knows how to deal with it before he's on his own
I admire for your ambitions to go to college as well as being very responsible on the financial side of things. Please talk to your parents. They will be thrilled to hear all these and do their best so that you can quit your job (at the very least reduce your work load) and concentrate on studies. If your parents need help, they can talk to your school counsellor. You can talk to the school counsellor yourself. I am sure your school and your parents will do whatever they can to help you. If you study well, you will go to college. Don't worry. Things will work out for you. You just need some help from elders now. There are many scholarships and ways of financial aid to go to college. Higher education is your insurance for your long term and happy future. Good luck.
Save it for your college bills.  It's never to early to start saving for college.  Investing in education is a premier choice.

Yes, but they're usually only as accurate as they have tax assessment data or other not so accurate data. The fact is that even when you bring in a professional agent, they do what they call a comp, looking for comparable houses in your area, they're still not always accurate. Unlike cars with an MSRP, houses have no absolute value at any given time. The value is what you get offered, but you have no offers yet. If you have time, start 20% or some other number, higher than the comps the agents pull up. Get an agent to pull some comps. Try to work an agreement with an agent that can be shelved for some period of time to reassess the listing price.

"When you say ""in process"" does that mean an offer has been submitted and you have not received an answer? If that is the case then I would suspect that this is a mistake on the part of the IRS. If you have submitted an offer, you should already have a contact there that you are dealing with: that is where to start. If you get now satisfaction from that route, get on-line at www.irs.gov and find the telephone number for your local Taxpayer Advocate. This person can put an immediate stop to collections for a limited period of time and will look into the facts prior to re-starting a collection action. Be persistent."

I work 12 hr s night shifts 7pm-730 am and have three small kids and attend college class, so I swear by these suggestions: stay busy at all times, eat small meals, stand instead of sitting. I only have to work 32 hrs which is considered full time I do one day in the middle of the week  and then two days together. This helps with gettign sleep. The first night I am well rested so there is usually no problem in staying awake nor being too tired. The first of the two nights I am rested b/c I had a break, the third night is my sleepest b/c I usually get less sleep due to my kids being up. I make sure I try to go to sleep immediatly after arriving at home trying to bypass the second wind. Its almost impossible to stay awake we are fight our bodies natural rhythm. Good luck.

This is just a couple of paragraphs a copied and pasted from the bottomm links ( this is a fairly long article). They helped me a lot when i was researching about short/long term forex  strategies and tips. All the rest of the helpful articles are in the 'forex resources' section on http://www.forextradinghq.com\n\n\nIn order to profit from the forex market, you will need strategies and also the will to change these strategies. Traders who lack a well thought out trading plan are prone to panic and confusion, when unexpected swings in the forex market occur. Many traders will tell you that trade driven by emotion is the fastest way to deplete your funds. Whether or not you are using a technical or fundamental style, it is still essential that you have a proper view of the market.\n\nDeveloping your own trading style is a time consuming process and is often acquired through trail and error. It is unfortunate that there is no ‘golden’ rule’ to trade in the forex market and technical and fundamental styles of trade won’t be successful all the time. Successful traders often have a unique style of trading and take up various strategies during a trading session. Only continuous practice will help you gain a feel for the movements of the forex market.
Make sure you get a copy of the check from your bank.  also proof that it was cashed.

Also ask if you are owed additional monies from profits made.  Don't be scared, its your money and your decision.

"Because they are foolish.  An out of state (DE) corporation will have to qualify to do business in the state where it maintains its business office.  Typically that costs as much as incorporating in the home state in the first place.  So you end up paying double to start & again year after year & maybe paying for a registered agent in DE when you can be your own for free.  Most businesses should incorporate in the state where they intend to do business & where they have their employees. \n\nThe only real ""advantages"" of a DE incorporation are for public companies doing business in multiple jurisdictions."

Well, as long as she can get a regular job here fairly quickly she should be fine. 3000 pound is about 7,500 Aus dollars which is enough to put a deposit on a rental house and pay the rent for a little while (depending on which city she moves to - e.g. Sydney is really expensive, Adelaide is pretty good and Hobart is quite cheap) and probably get a few essential items like a fridge, bed, chair... She might have to do it tough for a while but if she is prepared to work hard she could probably do it. It is going to be quite difficult with a baby though - child care can be very expensive here.

Different things motive different people.  You have to determine what motivates you.  Money, attention, recognition, training, growth potential, etc.  Look for a company that will provide you with what it is you want from life.  Remember that there is no future in any job.  The future lies in the person who holds the job.  Be a person of integrity and always do your best, not for the company but for yourself.  Make sure you can look in the mirror each day and know that you have done your job the very best it can be done.  Most employees don't do this even when someone is standing over them.  You will be successful in most careers if you will persevere, be positive, loyal and a person of integrity.
No.  \n\nCash from a refinance is proceeds from a loan.  This is not taxable.  On the contrary, the interest you pay may (or may not) be tax deductable depending on what the collateral is (is it a house?).

Your friend won't be able to do anything with the bonds since they are registered in the deceased man.  They would have to be re-registered and without any kind of supporting documentation, the registering agent wouldn't re-issue in your friends name.\n\nBest thing would be to perhaps find out from the newspaper who placed the estate ad, or maybe find out who ran the estate auction (if it was an auction).
Never, when interest rates go down, your mortgage will not.  When they go up your rate will go up.  I am not sure why that person said an arm may be a good idea.\n\nPeople who opt for mortgages other than fixed either have bad credit or don't know any better.  The mortgage company's get you hooked by giving you a rate of 1% the first year and then it increases.  Arms give you an extremely low rate then jump up extremely high to make up for those years.  They assume you will have more money and be in a better financial position.  Your best bet for any mortgage if you have good credit is fixed with the going rate at the current time.
"Immoral? Filing for bankruptcy was the hardest thing I ever did. People get into debt for various reasons - divorce, illness, poor money management, easy access to credit and numerous other reasons. Filing for bankruptcy involves quite a bit more than walking into a trustee's office and signing some papers. Sometimes life doesn't go according to your plans and filing for bankruptcy is usually a last resort, not a question of morality. It's not ""taking the easy way out"" at all. Why morality would even enter into decision to claim bankruptcy is beyond me. How easy it is to judge someone in that position; just hope it doesn't happen to you one day."

He needs to find another house and see if due to the circumstances his buyer will work with him on the occupancy (close) date.  \n\nMy question is why his Realtor did not find out from the listing agent and/or listing agent's broker what happened.  Different states have different rules and at this point there is probably no recourse.  In Ohio, if there are offers presented at the same time, all are reviewed prior to making a decision on one.  Since this was 2 days later that he was told the seller went with a different offer, when was the other contract submitted?  What was the open for acceptance on your father-in-law's?  There are several different things that could have happened that his Realtor should have followed up on and explained to him.  I'm not an agent just a mortgage loan officer who has worked with several agents and bought 3 houses and sold 2 of my own.  This is just from experience only and questions that I would be asking.
Most states have a redemption period, but there is a catch: You have to redeem the loan and any fees and accrued interest for cash.  In other words, you have to either find the cash from somewhere (unlikely) or get someone to loan it to you (equally unlikely).\n\nIn this case, you say you want to sell the property.  It is too late for that.  You needed to do that *before* the trustee's sale.  No lender in the world is going to agree to that request.  They've already gone and spent the money for default, lost all the interest and payments and everything, sat on this non-performing loan for months and months, and after they finally decide you're not going to save it and they bite the bullet and foreclose, and suddenly, now that it's no longer yours, you want to sell?  Ask a lawyer in your state, but I don't think you're going to have much luck with that one.\n\nFurthermore, it's not like people didn't try to tell you.  Anywhere in the country, as soon as that Notice of Default hit, you had real estate agents and lawyers and hard money lenders by the dozen trying to talk to you.  Yeah, they were trying to sell you something.  That doesn't alter the fact that the most important thing they told you was that you needed to take some kind of action right then, and whatever else they told you, that much was the truth.\n\nI know this is going to be hard to accept.  That doesn't change the facts.  You agreed to pay the loan back.  You didn't.  Furthermore, you did nothing with that grace period (absolute minimum of about seven months here in California) that the law gives you in which to act.  Forget that property.  It is gone.  Move forward and get on with your life.
everything varies. depending on the valuation of the property.
It probably depends on how good you are at your job.

You will need to get specific advice depending on specific circumstances but CGT certainly might be. My wife inherited a share of a house which was valued for inheritance tax purposes. On sale of the house at a higher value, CGT became liable on the uplift in value from inheritance value to final sales value.\n\nI suppose if you recieved cash after inheritance tax then it is difficult to see that this would be subject to further tax, although any interest recieved if placed in savings, would be liable for income tax purposes...

"BLACK FRIDAY (SHOPPING) - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_Sale\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, is historically one of the busiest retail shopping days of the year. Many consider it the ""official"" beginning to the holiday season. Most retailers will open very early and usually provide massive discounts on their products.\n\nAlthough Black Friday is typically the busiest shopping day of the year in terms of customer traffic, it is not typically the day with the highest sales volume. That is usually either Christmas Eve or the last Saturday before Christmas.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe first use of this term to describe the day after Thanksgiving is not exactly known. There are two popular theories as to its origin.\n\nAccounting practice\n\nOne theory is that stores traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season. When this would be recorded in the financial records, common accounting practices use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink would show positive amounts. Black Friday is the beginning of the period where they would no longer have losses (the red) and instead take in the year's profits (the black).\n\nStress from large crowds\n\nAnother theory comes from the fact that shopping experience on this day can be extremely stressful. The term is used as a comparison to the extremely stressful and chaotic experience of Black Thursday or other black days. According to The Word Spy:\n\nEarliest Citation:\nChristmas decorations around Tampa Bay started going up in late October, and business has been brisk since then. And while Friday--known as Black Friday for the legendary hordes--will be the biggest shopping day for many area stores, others ring up the greatest sales the Saturday before Christmas.\n—Marilyn Marks, ""Retailers expect good sales this Christmas,"" St. Petersburg Times, November 27, 1986\n\nThere exists an earlier reference, speaking to the Friday after Thanksgiving:\n\nA BLACK FRIDAY.\nThere have been many Black Fridays in recent history. Most of them have been days of financial panic. There has been none of blacker foreboding than last Friday. And the blackness is not loss or fear of loss in stocks and bonds.\nNew York Times (1857-Current file).\nNew York, N.Y.: Dec 3, 1922. pg. 38, 1 pgs\nISSN/ISBN 03624331\n\nEmployees of retail stores have for years referred to Black Friday in a satirical way, to note the extremely stressful and hectic nature of the day. Heavy traffic and customer demands added to the long hours make it a difficult day.\n\n\nBlack Friday on the Internet\n\nAdvertisements in advance\n\nCertain websites such as DealTaker.com offer information about Black Friday deals up to a month in advance. The text listings of prices are usually accompanied by adscans -- complete PDFs either leaked by insiders, or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.\n\nCyber Monday\n\nThe term Cyber Monday refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday, which unofficially marks the beginning of the holiday online shopping season.\n\nIn recent years, Cyber Monday has become a busy day for online retailers, with some sites offering low prices and other promotions on that day.\n\nControversy\n\nResponse (Buy Nothing Day)\n\nAnti-consumer frenzy protesters have chosen this day as Buy Nothing Day in North America, where those concerned about the increasing power and influence of consumer corporations are urged to not make consumer purchases.\n\nDMCA\n\nIn recent years, some retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target Corporation, Best Buy, and Staples, Inc.) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisement are intellectual property and protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\nUsing the t"

Ok, so what's the question?
Employers cover only a portion of unemployment.  The remainder is covered by the Federal government and the state.  This safety net helps hundreds of thousands of workers each year who are laid off with no prospect of a new job.  One of them was my father in the year 1972.  Another was me in the 80's.  Another was my sister's husband in the 90's.\n\nSometimes, we pay for things that we never personally use.  That doesn't mean that the thing isn't useful or wise to have paid.  I am happy to pay for house insurance; although I hope and pray that I may never need to cash in on the policy.  Likewise, I'm happy to pay the unemployment tax, though I hope and pray I never again need to make a claim.
The first home is the most challenging...so many questions.  But so much fun!\n\nIf the seller is using a broker, you should as well.  The seller is paying a set percentage to the agent (usually 5%-7%) of the sales price which gets split between the agents.  Your agent should be with a different agency to prevent conflicts of interest (there are never supposed to be conflicts, based on Realtor ethics codes enforced by the National Association of Realtors, but it's always better to be safe).  Your agent won't cost you a dime, and you'll have the benefit of representation.\n\nAn attorney (or title company, depending on your state) conducts the closing in all non-cash closings.  Don't get too anxious about specific attorneys, as long as they are reputable, they should be fine.  You could always pick a seperate one from the seller, but it isn't always necessary.\n\nYour fees will depend greatly on your shopping ability.  I suggest printing a copy of your credit report and carry it with you until you find a bank/mortgage company/credit union you are satisfied with.\nAsk questions like what is the APR you are offering.  The APR takes into account all points (a point is equal to 1% of the loan), fees, junk fees, origination fees, and the interest rate.  **Comparing APRs will allow you to compare apples to apples**  Comparing interest rates alone forces you to compare apples to oranges, bannanas, and even watermelons!\n\n**Check with your newly aquired realty agent, or the lenders that you are shopping with, on the availability of 1st time homebuyer incentives....there are litterally hundreds available that will reduce your down payment, APRs, points required, etc.***\n\nThis should be a lot of fun!  Remember that it is OK to get emotional regarding the house, but wait until you have closed and have the keys in your hand.  Keep emotion out of the shopping and financing portion of the process.\n\nHave a great time in your new home!  Best of luck.
"If you are looking for GOVERNMENT grants, only go to .GOV sites and NOT to any .com or .org or .net sites. Only .gov sites are legitimate -- the rest are out to scam you\n\nContrary to what the other answerers said, it is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. \n\nAnd yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born. The amount of paperwork and the bureaucratic processses and screening involved in government grants make it impossible to get grants in 4 days.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nI suggest you read the following books to get ideas of how to finance your business:\n\nFinancing Your Small Business  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1572484500/powerhomebizguid\nSmall Business Financing: How and Where To Get It http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0808007386/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing the Small Business: A Complete Guide to Obtaining Bank Loans and All Other Types of Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580626815/powerhomebizguid\nThe SBA Loan Book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158062202X/powerhomebizguid\nAngel Capital : How to Raise Early-Stage Private Equity Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471690635/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing Your Small Business (Barron's Business Library Series) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764124897/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online http://gtionline.fdncenter.org  .

If the date is incorrect you can dispute it.\n\nNever ask a collector anything, they have no interest in helping you and often try to get you to send them even a partial payment which will allow them to re-age your account so it shows up for ANOTHER 7 years on your credit report.  \n\nOften collectors will try to collect on debt that is so old that it is beyond the statute of limitations for your state and is legally unenforceble debt.

The middle 50 percent earned between $22.72 and $33.82 an hour. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $18.05, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $40.70 an hour.\n\nEarnings vary by geographic location, employment setting, and years of experience. Dental hygienists may be paid on an hourly, daily, salary, or commission basis.\n\nBenefits vary substantially by practice setting and may be contingent upon full-time employment. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), almost all full-time dental hygienists employed by private practitioners received paid vacation. The ADA also found that 9 out of 10 full-time and part-time dental hygienists received dental coverage. Dental hygienists who work for school systems, public health agencies, the Federal Government, or State agencies usually have substantial benefits.

I would find a good agent and let the agent handle all tenant issues and handle fixing of the house.\nIf you sell and come home, you will have to start over. If you keep your home you have another year's equity and the tenant has paid your payments. Also you might have a nice little profit.\nThe cons? Unless you have a supervising agent who knows how much to collect as far as deposits and to check references, you may get tenants that move out not paying, or may damage the property. Those would be the most important concerns. \nFinally, a compromise: I knew people who have traveled for six months at a time. During each period two mates lived in. If you know people who are willing to keep up with small repairs and pay the payments, then you can have at least a bit of your cake and eat it as well. That would be my first choice. Because they would be paying only the payments you would not have to declair any as taxes. A nice little arrangement.

Not talking in loud tones, this is especially important when others are on the telephone.\nBeing sure someone is not too busy before you start asking them something. Say excuse me do you have a minute, I need to ask you a question, if it looks like they are doing something, in their own office, etc.\nDon't express your opinion about every little thing. Keep it to yourself. If you don't like something about the office, you can mention it to the supervisor but don't keep harping on it, they will get the message even though they might not do anything about it.\nA lot of communication can be done by e-mail, do whatever is your companys policy/protocol.

Sure if you wanted some liquidity, guarantees and as a means to compliment a more aggressive retirement strategy, i.e. save 3 times as much with a savings bond and never quit working.  Savings bonds are easier to get to, but I wouldn't necessarily put more than a few months to a couple years worth of expenses into one.  The problem with savings bonds is that over the long run they will 97% of the time not out perform a stock index.  Stocks are based on companies making more and more money each year.  Savings bonds are the gov'ts ability to print more money.  With that said, companies are still better at making profits than the gov't.

"You can try pay per click programs such as Google Adwords http://www.google.com/adwords or Yahoo Search Marketing http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com – though the key is to carefully track your ROI and which keywords actually perform well\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\nRecommend Site Scripts (various) http://php.resourceindex.com/Complete_Scripts/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nBig Nose Bird Recommend this Site http://bignosebird.com/carchive/birdcast.shtml \nCGI Resource Index http://cgi.resourceindex.com/Programs_and_Scripts/Perl/Website_Promotion/Recommend_Site/\nHostscripts http://www.hotscripts.com/PHP/Scripts_and_Programs/Site_Recommendation/index.html\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. \n\nhttp://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html\nhttp://i-newswire.com/\nhttp://www.24-7pressrelease.com/\nhttp://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/add.cgi\nhttp://www.pr.com/press-releases\nhttp://www.prfree.com/\nhttp://www.clickpress.com/releases/index.shtml\nhttp://www.theopenpress.com/\nhttp://www.przoom.com/\nhttp://www.prweb.com\nhttp://www.newswiretoday.com/\nhttp://www.free-press-release.com/\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions.

The question is very vague as it does not cover any specific industry.  I've a similar degree and have served in management positions in retail and apparel.  In retail, I managed a convenience store and earned $ 25,000 a year starting.  In apparel, I served in an accounting capacity and earned $ 30,000 a year.  The answer to your question lies in both the type of industry the company is in (retail, apparel, railroad, technology, etc.) and your own supplementary skills and education (accounting, programming, human resources, etc.).  Focussing with a management degree alone isn't sufficient to ascertain a starting salary without also looking at the industry and your function within the company.

"The basic rule is : design a site for the user, not for the search engines. Create great original content that users would love and other sites would want to link to -- and top rankings in the search engine will follow. \n\nContent must be compelling, accessible and unique - this is a key ingredient in getting links. Make sure people can link to specific content.\n\nHere are tips by Adam Lasnik, Google's search evangelist (yes, that's his actual title)\n\nMake your pages easy to index. Think about the terms that visitors will use to search for your information and make sure your pages include those words. Provide a unique title tag and meta description tag for each page. Use descriptive anchor text when linking to other pages of your site (e.g., ""Obtain the latest federal tax forms for 2006"" instead of ""Click here for 2006 federal tax forms"") \n\nMake your pages easy to find.  Provide an HTML sitemap that contains links to pages deeper in the site. On your home page, include links to the major sections inside the site. If your site includes many pages, consider creating a browsable set of links that enables the visitor to choose a category, then see links within that category. \n\nMake sure search engines can access the content.  Ensure pages of your site can be reached without cookies, registration, session IDs, or forms. Verify that your site isn't blocked with a robots.txt file and that search engines don't receive errors when trying to access your pages. (You can check both of these things using Google's webmaster tools.) \n\nDon't be an island.  Responsibly interact with realted sites to garner natural links, and -- more importantly -- mindshare.  Search engine conferences are a great opportunity to learn and network, but participation on forums and blogs can also be very productive. \n\nStudy the source.  Regularly review search engines' often-updated official written advice (e.g., Webmaster Guidelines, blogs, etc.).\n\nYou can read more of Adam's tips at http://docs.google.com/Doc.aspx?id=a4bb8f9kppt_0drmp5z&access=firstgov\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\nWebmasterWorld.com http://www.webmasterworld.com has different sections that cover various aspects of search engine optimization, and each section is participated in by respected webmasters and even search engine employees (e.g. there's a GoogleGuy that responds to Google topics)\n\nOther resources that can help you get top ranking in the search engines are:\n\nGoogle Press Releases http://googlepress.blogspot.com/ \nMatt Cutts Blog (Adam's boss) http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/  (Matt is a Google software engineer)\nDigitalpoint Yahoo Forums http://forums.digitalpoint.com/forumdisplay.php?f=6\nSearchEngineWatch's MSN Forums http://forums.searchenginewatch.com/forumdisplay.php?f=8\n\nAs for tools to help you get top rankings in the search engine, here are some of the best in the field today\n\nTotal Optimizer Pro http://www.totaloptimizer.com/\nKeyword density tool http://googlerankings.com/ultimate_seo_tool.php\nGoogle Sitemaps (to help Google index your pages faster) https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/siteoverview?hl=en\nSEO Book - lots of free great SEO tools http://tools.seobook.com/"

"There are steps that you can take to break your lease because of the situation, but the situation itself doesn't automatically release you from your lease.\n\nLook up the procedure in your state for a constructive eviction.  There are notice requirements and the landlord has to be given an opportunity to correct the situation.  Notice requirements are determined by the state, and your having ""complained"" a few times may not qualify.  \n\nYou will probably have to send a certified letter, wait a period of time (10 days, 2 weeks, etc) for action to be taken and then if the situation still has not improved you can break your lease without penalty.\n\nSome landlords do challenge constructive eviction claims.  If they do, you will need a lawyer at that point."

Be VERY Careful.  I've been down that road and although we have been successful, it's been in spite of our franchiser (Meineke) rather than because of them.  In hindsight, I'd strongly recommend looking at existing businesses (both franchise & nonfranchise).  You can sometimes purchase an existing business for about the same investment.  Do a little research and you'll sees some real bargains from disillusioned owners that just want to walk away. Even if you get hit with some goodwill, it usually is more than worth it to walk into a business that is already profitable.  You'll limit your risk and take a huge load of stress off your shoulders.\n\nA good website is www.franchise-chat.com
"Maybe because of unfair treatment of their employees, prices that keep going up, discontinuing programs such as lay-aways and such. According to others, they have been ""going downhill"" since Mr. Walton passed away."
That is where the hub is set up for sprint. In that county. probably was before any set up for your exact area. Check to see if the area has a newer tax for your area. You can do this by calling the Public Utility Commisions in your area. You can also call Sprint and have them fill out a complaint form to find out why you pay a county tax for a different county and they will get it straightened out with the PUC for ya. Chances are if the number was established long ago then it ran out of a different county sector. Hope this helps.
If you can get to his car in the parking lot.\n\nGo to the auto parts store.  Get a tire valve tool, and then loosen the valves in his tires so that they leak slowly.  Start with one, then on later days start the others.\n\nGet a turkey baster and hose and squirt oil up into the exhaust pipe.

Are you seriously asking why the Nigerian government doesn't stop scammers and corruption?\n\n\nTheft, lying and deception are part of their national characteristics. We shouldn't try to impose our western values ( i.e., decency and morals) onto Nigerians. It's disrespectful.
Stay away from the quick-cash Pay-Day loan or check-cashing places.  They're legal usury.  If you're even a little late on a payment, you could end up owing up to 600% of the original loan.  \n\nAre you in good health?  Sell some plasma.  You can do it twice a week and you're saving a life to boot.  Go through your old Cd's and sell the ones you're done with to Graywhale or another used-music seller.  There are several ways to pull money together without driving yourself further into debt.
They double charge you then eventually screw up your credit, and other payday loan offices will find out, and you'll never be able to get a loan from them again. PAY BACK the loan, they helped you in good faith, now you do the right thing and pay them back, otherwise youre nothing but a bank robber.

In my view, the first objective of any commercial bank is to maximise profit for his share holders. The second is to comply with all the rules and regulation set by the Bank of England and other regulatory bodies in the UK. Third is to use the marketing strategy to expand the business and  find new avenues to increase profit. Fourth is the customer service role which has been neglected in recent years, but some banks are try to address this issue.

As a struggling entrepreneur who recently set up my website and got hooked up to receive payment with paypal I can tell you it is confusing.  Call the phone number that is given for customer service on the www.paypal.com site and talk to a real person who can answer your question.  They can help you get set up and will make sure it works for you.  Take advantage of their customer service dept. - make sure it is done correctly so that your money can come to you.

"Absolutely not.  I agree with ""knowssignlanguage"" in part.  With your qualifications, you should NOT be having trouble.  My guess is that you're in a bad region for your offerings.  In SF Bay Area, the job boards, newspapers, websites are flooded with ads for IT guys.\n\nCan you consider moving to an area with better potential?  And, yes, that tends to support the idea of Monster.com.\n\nPS:  In another response, CV is noted as an 'also-rand' with ""resume"".  A ""CV"" is a Curriculum Vitae.  Roughly translated from Latin, it's your statement of your Life's Study.  The term is ONLY used in academic circles.  Unless you intend to teach (which might be an idea for you), don't even use the term.  Flipping terms like that around when they don't apply means YOU don't really know what it means and you're over your head.  It puts BIG questions ion the listener's head. \n\nYour qualifications are good.  Stay on SOLID ground.\n."

"Generally speaking, no.\n\nTens of thousands of non-profits do in fact earn money on investments (it's called an ""endowment"" or ""foundation"") and they don't normally pay taxes.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is worth around $32 Billion and they don't pay taxes on their investments.\n\nA non-profit might fall under a law that would compel them to pay taxes if they don't spend enough of the investment income."
are you willing to move and get paid a little in order to gain experience? i would recommend experience over more school (MBA). keep looking. look at clubs/professional organizations, trade magazines in the field you are seeking. remember you can't start at the CEO or senior VP.
It'd be nice if you could find people who arent online.\nLike an old friend who doesnt have internet service or maybe doesnt even own a pc.
Knew someone who worked for the Post Office in the United States and based on this fact I would say that you need to inquire of the Post Office what skills they are looking for.  Then based on the information you are able to gather I would say practice those skills for a period of time.  In the case of working for the Post Office here the hopeful job applicant must take a test and if the job applied for is one of a delivery Postman then you will be tested on where addresses are located.  Additionally it helps if you can supply previous work experience information that shows your ability to be punctual (on time) and any other information they might be seeking.\n\nMight add here that the delivery Postman only needs to know his particular route.  If you are chosen to work inside the Post Office, then you will have to learn all of the routes because you will be one of the people who sorts the mail for all of the mail carriers (delivery Postmen).
I would not wear any clothes that have the labels of other clothing stores (i.e. American Eagle or Abercrombie).  My daughter used to work for A.E., and she just dressed in nice pants and shirt.  She looked nice and she got the job.    Don't have  your stomach showing!  Good luck.

Vector marketing is a company that sells cutco cutlery. I worked for them a few years ago and it was horrible. They want you to go door to door to sell $700.00 knife sets, and the knives that you use to demonstrate will cost you about $200.00. If anyone of your customers returns the knives that they buy you'll have to pay back the comission you earned. It's a horrible company, don't do it.

You should do some research on the audience you are looking to target (stats etc..). Be brief and concise and state everything in point form. Also include a rate card a business card, ad specifications, and a summary of what your publication is all about.

There are different types of bankruptcy. A chapter 13 bankruptcy might work for you. Under chapter 13, you keep some of your more important possessions such as your home and its mortgage, while other items such as cars, furniture, appliances, etc...must be returned (with their debts released). The bills that cannot be wiped free, such as the mortgage and student loans, will be consolidated with the payment due to a trustee.\nI'm sure the laws are different in different states, so consult a lawyer. Make sure you use bankruptcy as a LAST RESORT. The damage to your credit will be a hardship for several years. Good luck!
That depends.\n\nHow soon do you want it?  Why not a tax-deferred account?  Why settle for 9% when the stock market averages 10-12%?\n\nIn the meantime, here's a fun fact for you:  If you save $1 per day for 100 years, you'll have almost $500 million, assuming it's tax-deferred.

"You are very young.  There is plenty of time for you to develop a skill that does not rely heavily on ""academic"" subjects.\n\nDo you have any hobbies?  Almost any hobby can lead to a career, if you think creatively about it.  If you have any talent for music or art or athletics, there are careers in those fields.  Do you make things?  Could you develop a skill there, and become a master craftsman or related professional?  Do you have a good eye for a bargain, and could make your way as a buyer for a shop?  There are thousands of careers that do not rely on an academic degree, and the advantage is you get to start earlier than those who must slog through four years of college.  \n\nYou need to be able to assess your strengths and weaknesses, your likes and dislikes, as honestly as possible.  I strongly recommend you get a copy of ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" to do this self-analysis.  A second-hand one will do, as it does not need to be the most current one.  You are too young to be actively seeking employment yet.  But it will get you thinking about what you can do, and channel your energies into developing what you do best.\n\nGood luck!  And if you find you are a competent sculptor or designer, and start making dolls for a living, let me know.  I'd love to be one of your first customers!"
the only thing more dangerous than someone with bad credit is someone with no credit. they are wary of you since you have no established credit, your a student blah blah blah. it takes them awhile to verify your status, residence, job (if you have one), and your account status. if you had established credit then it wouldn;t necessarily take this long to approve or deny your application. if you do get this one and are financilly responsible; when you apply for other cards in the future, the response time will be a lot quicker. basically, once they can pin you down, see you can make payments, you'll get it.
Leaving a single message is fine, leaving multiple messages is rude.
"You have to start at the very beginning: Private Property.\n\nThe more property in private hands, the more stability. People take their property and exchange with one another; forming a marketplace. \n\nThis exchange creates Prices.\n\nPrices give us the VERY valuable indicators of Profits & Losses.\n\nProfits and Losses tell us WHERE our Earth's scarce resources should be applied.\n\nFor example, high profits tell property owners ""Invest your resources here...this is where the demand is.""\n\nAt the same time, losses tell property owners ""Remove your scarce resources from this area and apply them where they are in higher demand.""\n\nA smooth, efficient marketplace, creates stability. There is no reason to fight or go to war...instead we trade. \n\nIt all begins with private property.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, you have Socialism, where the government owns all of the property. In other words, there is only one property owner.\n\nUnder such a system, you do not have trade (since one property owner cannot trade with itself).\n\nWithout trade, you do not have prices.\n\nWithout prices, you do not have profits or losses.\n\nUnder such circumstances, there is no rational way to know where our Earth's scarce resources should be applied. It's all done by political whim.\n\nThus, you have corruption, instability, and a huge tendency to go to war.\n\nIt all starts with Private Property."
It's a brochure that is designed to be folded so the outside panels have the mailing indicia, return address and promotional copy on what would be considered the 'front' of the piece.\n\n81/2 x 14 is too big to pass through normal postal standards, so your dimensions must mean that is the final size of the piece when unfolded.\n\nTry to design the mailer so that when folded, it conforms to USPS 'regular' size mail.

"""If you build it, they will come"" is not necessarily true on the Web. Putting a website up is one thing, but getting visitors to come to your site is another. The process becomes even more difficult if you have limited resources to market your business.\n\nHere are some shoestring marketing ideas that can help you get the visitors you need at the least cost possible: \n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles such as excerpts from your book and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.\n\n6. Improve your conversion. Getting visitors is one thing; getting them to buy your products is a whole different story. Read the article ""10 Ways to Convert Visitors to Buyers"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/072005/conversion.htm for tips on how to improve your conversion rates.\n\n7. Create a blog and market it with the Resources for Marketing Your Blogs and RSS Feeds http://www.powerhomebiz.com/onlinemarketing/blogs.htm"
"You cand find information on various websites like banrate.com or xmortgage.com, etc, etc.\n\nI also have numerous articles like:\n\n""To doc or not to doc, that is the question!!""\n""Confused about ARMs and FRMs??""\n""Loans with 1% minimum payment? Be careful Get informed!""\n\nand many more if you follow this link http://jrealestate.blogspot.com\n\nGood luck"

in your browser search bar type 'Jobs in Japan'.  There are many websites for this.  You should be able to type the same sort of thing in Kanji and find some websites for jobs in Japan.  I found some sites by simply typing in 'Jobs in Japan'\n\nYou can also type in 'Work in Japan' or others.
Establishing a great credit rating can be challenging. But there are some steps you can take to significantly improve your rating if you know what to do (and what not to do).\nFor example, don't open up a bunch of low-limit credit cards. Each time someone does a credit check on you, it may affect your actual score (lowering it)... \nI'm not a financial advisor, but I did get some great tips from a reputable one. I really recommend you talk to someone you or your family has already dealt with, like a mortgage broker or loans officer, or even someone at your bank...
There should be a number on the back of the cards that you can call and find out the balance. YOu should check them because though these are gift cards, if you don't use them by a certain period of time you actually can lose money on them. The companies will start charging against the cards. \n\nI would even check the stores that the cards were purchased from, some stores now have devices throughout them that allows you to scan your gift cards and it gives you the balance.
A second job(assuming you have one already) would be your best bet.  \nOr if you could get a small acting gig on comercials or small time modeling.  \nJust don't do anything stupid like selling drugs or prostitution\n\ngood luck!
I'm assuming you're self-employed.\n\nYou need to get liability insurance so if you accidentally break something you'll be covered.  There are insurance policies written specifically for this type of risk - you'll need to contact a local commercial agent to assist you.\n\nIf you have a substantial amount of tools or equipment that you use to clean the boat you'll want to get coverage for those as well (if you're tools are only worth $200 though I'd just skip this coverage)\n\nIf you have employees you'll want to consider Workers Compensation.\n\nIf you can afford it health insurance is a good thing for you to have.  Also, if you have a family or any type of dependent you might want to consider a term life policy.  You can get one from your agent or you can look online as well.

"right, look - no job is really that difficult that they have to look far and wide to find someone to fit the bill. What people are looking for is someone who can fit in/ add to the team. Don't be a stiff, be friendly and fun. Shy doesn't work. Nobody is going to want to hire a moody jerk who just gets his work done over in the corner.\nOh, an no matter how cliche it may sound - they will ask ""what your weaknesses are"". They can't help themselves, so be prepared. Just say that you ""lack practical experience,"" that'll do the trick.\nNow go get'em tiger!"
"There are two different types of life insurance\n1) Insurance with savings included in the package (known as cash value life insurance). These types of policies are also knowned as Whole Life, Universal Life, or Variable Life (or mixture of those words). They are always expensive because you are paying for two things (insurance and savings). Rate of return on savings are very low. In the first 3 years of the policy, no savings are accumulated. After 3 years, cash value starts to accumulate and you can borrow it anytime and pay it back with interest. If you borrow any cash value for whatever reasons, and you die without paying it back, this amount will be deducted from your face amount. Upon your death, all cash value will be kept by the insurance company. (All this info is stated in every cash value life policy).\n\n2) Regular insurance such as car insurance (known as Term insurance). These policies are known as ""pure insurance."" They are inexpensive, therefore you can get lots of coverage for a period of time. Since it is inexpensive, it gives you room to invest your money in the market (such as mutual funds). When investing, you should invest in the long term. No matter how the market performs, you should always continue to invest and don't pull out when the market does badly. Depending on how much you invest, you may not need life insurance or not as much coverage in 20 or 30 years. By that time, you should have less financial obligations to pay such as child support, college education, credit card debts, and mortgage. If you are still considering life insurance in 20 to 30 years, you should seek to lower your coverage because of your lower financial obligations than you have now.\n\nI personally own Primerica Life insurance. I bought a 30 year Term with $250,000 coverage. I pay approximately $35/month for it. I also invest $100/month into mutual funds. I'm hoping in 30 years, my mutual fund value is bigger than my life coverage by then. If I were to buy whole life insurance from Metlife, it would of cost me at least $200/month. So which company is good in NY? I would have to say Primerica. Even though I live in NJ, we're close enough."
"What do you mean by ""good?""  You can probably get a job with the US Government if you can interpret Arabic language, my friend is from Jordan and she makes some killer money doing that.  Also, you will face some prejudice in smaller cities, be prepared, stay in the big cities and you should do fine.  It also depends on your education and previous work history."
Adecco should be providing you with a stub for what THEY pay you.  Usually they are mailed to you at home or at work.  Adecco invoices the party you work for, so you would have to ask the HR person at your work to see what they are paying the agency.  They may or may not want to release the info, depending on their policies.
Unless you have the knowledge or resources to make a prototype yourself, your going to need a company to help you. However like the previous poster said if they are the ones that advised you not to get a patent then i'd be very wary. There are reputable companies that do deal in this but I couldn't tell you who. You could go with the private investors but again unless you can make it, or know someone who can what good will that money do?
"RUN FAR AWAY from Amway, and don't let anyone talk you into signing up! It is a SCAM (even though it's legal) and you'll invest far more time and money into it than you get back. In fact, you'll be lucky to get anything back at all. Look on google, there are support groups and websites for people who have been burned by Amway. The peer pressure that the people in this group will give you is unbelievable. It's the closest thing to a cult that a non-religious group can get!\n\nLOL Looks like the MLM people found you here. They'll do anything to hook you in and get you in their group! Theoretically it would work if you got a lot of people signed up under you, but the truth is people run when you mention Amway or any other MLM group, so you're not going to do anything except make your friends and family leery of hanging around you. People don't like their friends trying to take advantage of them by pressuring them into a ""business opportunity."" And if you try to rope in someone who's already into an MLM business, they'll just try to get you into theirs. Perfect example: some of the people who have already posted to you."
Just because you don't have credit yet doesn't mean that you can't get an apartment.  They'll require references, as well as proof of sufficient income to pay the rent.  You'll have to put up the usual security deposit and first month's rent.  Some states allow landlords to collect first and last month's rent in advance so you may have to come up with that.\n\nI used to rent some properties out and never accepted or asked for a cosignor.  More hassle than it was worth.  \n\nEspecially with younger prospective tenants, their look and behavior (clean and neat, well spoken, etc. NOT race!) would usually factor in.  For the most part they didn't meet my standard qualifications so saying no was entirely defensible.\n\nOnce you do get accepted, be a good tenant!  That will help you well into the future.  Pay your rent on time, stick to the terms of your lease, keep things neat and orderly, keep the parties to a minimum and the noise to zero.
What province are you in?  Electrical engineers are needed in Alberta working at the oil sands in Fort McMurray.  I would think work in British Columbia would be fairly easy to find as well in your career.
"First, you are not alone.  There are many out there that are ""stuck"" in the mire of what to do when we grow up.\n\nWith that said, I would encourage you to think about some of the following things:\n1.  What do you enjoy doing?  What can you do and lose total track of time while doing it?\n2.  What are your strengths?  You can find out by reading the book ""Now, Discover Your Strengths"", by Donald Clifton and Marcus Buckingham.  There is also an on line assessment you can take by buying the book and it can help you determine your signature talents.  \n3.  What kind of lifestyle do you want to have?  What kind of income does that require?  \n4.  What are your values?  What matters most to you?\n\nAnswering the above questions will help you start a journey of self discovery and awareness about how to take action.  There are fundamental career decisions everyone has to make and by digging deeper into your needs you can paint a clear path to happiness, but it starts with action.\n\nI would also recommend taking a few classes at a local junior/community college to see what might peak your interests.  While enrolled, utilize any and all career services  they have to assist you in making a well informed decision.\n\nI hope this helps!"
They get a carrot...and they dangle it!
It depends on what you consider Great Paying and how hard you are willing to work.  Real Estate pays great.  You don't have to have a college education, but you have to take a pre licensing course and courses thereafter to keep your licensure.  None of them are very long.  In Florida the longest course is a 72 hour course I believe, and that is for a real estate broker.  Realtors have to work to get the sale though.  So while it is good money it doesn't come easy.  I also know that some truck drivers and building contractors who make a good living.  Again it depends on what you consider GREAT PAYING.

The market is 'risk efficient': investment vehicles with the highest reward also have the highest risk.\n\nAs an example, ETFs of emerging stock markets have performed best in the last 2 years, but they are extremely risky and volatile (check the market action in the last few weeks).\n\nOne way to reduce risk while maintaining performance is to diversify: by holding ETFs covering different asset classes (such as US, foreign, small-cap etc...), the risk of your total portfolio will be less than the risk of its components taken separately.
Yes the HSE website will probably the up-to-date info you need, but basically they work like this ;\n\nPIck a workplace activity like climbing a ladder to inspect a piece of machinery. What is the chance of someone falling off the ladder.\n\nYou then have to look at the likelyihood of risk against the severity of an injury. The HSE website should have score charts or tables for you to make a calculation then it is normally down to the company to determine at what score they take action i.e.\n\nThe likelihood of the accident will be affected by a few things ;\n\nHow often is the activity undertaken, once per shift, once per hour or more - the more often the greater the risk. Is the ladder in good order, does it have a hand rail. Is the floor slippery, does the employee have adequate footware etc.\n\nThe severity of tha accident will also be affected by a number of things like , does the employee have adequate ppe, how high is the ladder, will he fall onto something, will he be hit by something, and also will he be found quickly if he knocs himself out.\n\nHope this helps.
How can this NOT bother you...if age was the primary reason you were turned down?  Im 59, just lost out on a great job for which I was incredibly qualified and I know darn well it was my age.....for the first time in my professional life, I have to face the age thing and it's not pretty.

If it is online lottery you won through your email, then don't replay to such emails. On the internet there are lot of people cheating in this way. First they will ask to to pay some money. if you won ask him to deduct the the charges from your won amount. but they will not agree because there intension is to take mony from you. after giving mony they will not contact you. \n   There are lot of cases happen in the past to be carefull and contact to police to arrest such criminal
They exist, but it works out to about $2 per hour and they pay after 60 days. You will wade through spam until you change your e-mail address, too. There are a couple of thousand that will promise you the moon, however.\n\nYou might register with every temporary agency in town and tell them you are willing to work nights and weekends; they sometimes get a request for a fill-in waitress or other low-paying unskilled labor.\n\nThe places that take your check and hold it for two weeks charge 390% interest in my area; $15 per hundred for 2 weeks.

My husband is an analyst.  He gets up usually around 5-5:30 AM, makes coffee for me, lets the dogs out, brings the coffee up to me and checks our personal stocks on one computer and turns on his laptop to check out what is happening at work.  He sits on his laptop watching transportaion flows all over the US, checks weather to determine whether that will have an impact on shipments, answers e mails, his cell phone and pagers to solve problems and feeds the dogs between 8:30 and 9:00AM.\n\nThen he gets back on his computer and does the same thing until about noon when he takes his shower, asks me to help him pick out a tie for the suit and shirt he's wearing that day, packs up his laptop and goes into the office.\n\nWhile at work, he trains people on the programs that they are not using correctly, procedures they are not following and makes presentations about the same.  He also does evaluations and follow-up reports on large accounts that include suggestions and recommendations on what could have been done better and what was done well. \n\nThen around the time Oprah comes on, he calls me to ask if there is anything he needs to pick up at the market so I can make dinner, stops by the market and comes home around 6:00-6:30 PM to a wonderful delicious gourmet dinner.  \n\nHe is, however, on 24 hour call so often has to answer his cell or return calls if there are any emergencies.  Usually, we take a spa after dinner, put on our jammies, watch some TV and go to bed around 9:00-9:30PM.  Oh, we let out the doggies before retiring.\n\nHe's worked for his company for 40 years since he was in high school, is well compensated and really loves his job.

Ok, first things first, what you did was VERY unwise. You borrowed money for your cousin and made no legal requirement on him to pay anything. The only thing you can do without getting sued is to make payments to the bank and makeup the past due balance. Hopefully you will learn from this experience.\n\nYou have a loan with the bank that you applied for and signed a contract with. The bank is not required to verify that you have a license to give you a loan. There is no requirement about where the documents can be signed.\n\nYou could possibly sue your cousin, however since you don't have any written contract with him, it will be difficult. Maybe he will just give you the car.
A lot of universities will.  Think about all the students who go to business school directly following their 4 year university.  You need to study for the GMATs and do well on those, then apply to whichever schools you like.\n\nTry the link below to see some starting points.
FHA loans are assumable and many adjustable rate loans are assumable.  The potential problem is that you have to cash out the owner's equity which means you have to pay them the difference between the loan balance and the sales price.  You also are charged an assumption fee, but it is not much, around $250- $500.  The person who told you you assumed the prior owner's payment history is wrong.  The lender puts the loan in your name and your payment history starts there.  When you assume a loan, you have to qualify just as if you were getting a loan.  This is so that the lender can release the prior owner from liability in case you default.  The potential benefit to an assumption would be if you could assume a loan at a low interest rate or assume an adjustable rate loan that you could convert to a fixed rate at a good rate of interest.  There are not as many assumptions these days because interest rates have been so low in the last 10 years that it made more sense for people to get a new loan than to assume one at a higher rate of interest.  In any case, you need to know what you can qualify for.  I have been both a mortgage banker and a mortgage broker and, based upon my experience, I would reccomend you call a mortgage banker to discuss your qualifying options.  Many mortgage brokers are fine loan officers, but you end up paying both the lender's fees and the broker's fees in many cases so it may be more cost effective to consult with a mortgage banker.  In addition, many mortgage banks have special comittments from the largest mortgage securitizers, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FHMC) that allow them to offer special loans to first time buyers, those with limited funds availability, or credit challenges.  Good luck and happy hunting.  I hope you find the home of your dreams.

Your startup costs will depend on several factors:\n\n- cost of lease in your area\n- size of the space you will be leasing for the bookstore\n- leasehold improvements\n- initial store facilities\n- initial inventory\n- equipment (credit card terminals, security alarms, etc)\n- insurance\n- legal (permits, licenses, lawyer to help with legal structure)\n- presale marketing and advertising\n\nThe space and improvements will be your biggest expense. One of my clients started a bookstore in the Washington DC area last year, and her startup costs reached as high as $128,000. If you live in an area with lower cost of living, you may be able to start with lower amounts.\n\nOne resource I highly recommend is the Christian Booksellers Association http://www.cbaonline.org/  In July there is an International Christian Retail Show  http://www.christianretailshow.com/ that you may want to check out

"Figure 8 to 15 cents per name, depending on the specifics for the list. Remember many list suppliers have a minimum order, usually 5,000 names. \n\nI usually ballpark about $1 per mailpiece ""in the mail"" including list, printing, postage, lettershop for a standard letter or flyer. \n\nTwo things:\n\n1) if it's basic consumers at home with a certain income, zip code etc, try www.infousa.com\n\n2) if it's a real niche, like old ladies who are into crochet, then go to a big city library and ask for the SRDS - Standard Rate and Data Service Direct Mail list guide.  Or you can buy it online but it's not cheap. \n\nAlso, this is a newbie question... be careful in Direct Mail, it's very powerful if you do it right but if you get even one element wrong your whole mailing is worthless. It's not a media that's beginner-friendly (it's easy to do, but hard to succeed)\n\nI strongly recommend you get a copy of ""Magnetic Marketing"" which is the classic work in this area - it's by Dan Kennedy available at www.dankennedy.com.

It all depends on the complexity of your return, where you live, and who you have prepare it.  Tax prep services like H&R Block usually have a set fee based on the forms they fill out for you.  A CPA will charge you an hourly rate plus expenses (which are nominal).  A small CPA firm will probably charge you around $75 per hour to prepare your return, a medium sized firm will be around $125, and a large firm can be from $150 to $300 per hour.  My suggestion would be to ask fellow business people in your area if they can recommend a CPA.  No matter the cost, trust and integrity are the most important qualities of a CPA.  If they're good, someone will recommend them.  :) PrissyPanda, CPA
"When it no longer meets the original reasons you invested in the first place.\n\nWhen it exceeds your ""asset allocation"" in its class. Consider (if that's the case) selling 25%, 50% etc of your total holdings.\n\nThe key to successful investing is having and maintaining a good ""asset allocation"". This is more important than getting the right stock or mutual fund."
There's no book or resource to specifically decipher all facets of an SEC filing. There are several SEC forms that public companies are required to file, most of which are rather meaningless to an investor. The key ones you should worry about are the 10Q and the 10K. \n\nThose two filings are the 'books' of each company. Filed quarterly, they include balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, etc. The book 'Guide to Investing', published by the New York Institute of Finance, is the best and easiest reading for learning the ins and outs of a companies accounting statements.

Mutual funds - take the investments of many investors collectively - invests them, and manages that investment.   Theoretically, the fund manager knows how to manage investments to make them grow.\n\nNo investment is completely free of risk.  But if you are in a reliable fund, with a competent manager - your risk should be minimal.
I'm not an expert by any means, but I pull and review credit reports almost daily for Apartment Management.  It just shows how many times in the last 3 months you've pulled your credit, but through the company I pull the reports, it doesn't lower your score if you do a 3-in-1.  However, don't pull your credit more than once a year if you can help it, because it raises eyebrows when anyone else pulls your credit.  Hope this helps!

No its not-most reputable insurance plans cover mental health and prescriptions  -sounds like he has a supplemental insurance plan and not  Major Medical which he needs to have-unfortunately even if he changes this is a preexisting condition and more than likely will have a waiting period to cover it.  He can get  prescription card now-search under prescription help and similar topics and can get one for approx 90 some dollars a year or even less . His family doctor can prescribe Zoloft-any MD can.Tell him to go for family doctor will understand his situation if he doesn't any MD will/can prescribe and then shop for lowest price like at Costco.

Well you are going to need to get a dealer's license. A friend of my boyfriend's is going to be a car dealer but he can't get his dealer's license unless he has a place. So first you need to get a place and find out if it is zoned for what you want to do.\n\nSo in order to figure out costs. First you need your rent of the building or if you are going to buy it. Than you need to figure out how much you are going to pay for utilities (phone, internet, gas, electric,etc) . Than you need to figure out what equipment you want in your service department and tools. Figure out what office equipment you need (desks, filling cabnients, etc). Next figure out what staff you want to start with. How many techs, receptionist, salesmen, etc. Figure out how much you are going to want to pay them. Keep in mind if they are full time you have to offer them benefits. Make contacts with Harley Davidson and other motorcylce companies to find out how much it will cost to buy motorcycles from them to sell. You are also going to want to figure out procedures (clocking in, filing systems, paperwork for buying the motorcycles, inventory) Also you have to file with your states taxation department to get a tax id number because you'll have to pay tax. Also you will want to get a tax exemption number to buy motorcylces and parts because you will techincally be reselling these things so you don't have to pay tax. You also have to register your name. Basically figure out what you need in terms of money so that you can get a start up loan. \n\nGot to small business admisitration website for more ideas \nhttp://www.sba.gov/\n\nAlso you need to figure out how you are going to let your customers pay, if you want to take credit cards you'll need a credit card machine. If you want to take checks you'll probably want a posted policy or in the contract for buying or getting a bike fixed that the bike will get put in their possession once the check goes through. Also you are going to need to talk to a bank about financing if people want to pay with a loan.\n\nHope this helps
oui

I have found a website that compiles various resources on starting a non profit. I especially like the Minnesota Council of NonProfits because the site gives information on governance, developing strategic alliances, fund raising and other ingredients of successfully running a non profit. \n\nhttp://www.lib.msu.edu/harris23/grants/znpbib.htm\n\nAs for funding your non profit, I suggest you check out Foundation Center to help you gain ideas on how to properly establish your organization and get support from private foundations. They have the most extensive database of private donors, and they publish a magazine that can be very helpful to your new non profit.\n\nhttp://fdncenter.org/getstarted/tutorials/establish/index.html\n\nI was previously involved in the setup of a non profit, and we were able to get a pro-bono lawyer who set up everything for us, including getting the 501c3 tax status. Contact other non profits in your area and check if there are lawyers willing to work for free to get you started. \n\nNon profits are just like any business - you need to get the word out in order to get the needed funding to help support your activities. Here are some tips to help you market your non profit:\n\n1. Determine your your target audiences: who are the groups and audiences that your non profit wants to reach. Remember that one target group may respond differently to a marketing message as another group so make sure that each strategy is tailor made for each audience.\n\n2. Develop a communications strategy, creating timelines for marketing efforts such as newsletters, press releases, special events, and others.\n\n3. Develop a visual image. Prepare your logo and other branding tools - and use them consistently across various mediums. Make sure that you repeat your branding messages, slogans in everything you make from brochures to newsletters.\n\n4. Employ multiple communications tactics: Nonprofit organizations often target several audiences, which may respond to different approaches. Various communications campaigns can help establish and maintain a more widespread positive image.\n\n5. Select and use appropriate media: Plan to use a combination of approaches best suited to reaching your targeted audiences and that make best use of your financial resources. Include a variety of methods including phone calls, letters, e-mail, newsletters, PSAs, press releases, and editorials.\n\nFor detailed information on how to start a non profit, I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Starting and Running a Nonprofit Organization -- by Joan M. Hummel\n- Starting and Running a Non-Profit Made Easy by Entrepreneur Press, David H. Bangs\n- Starting & Building A Nonprofit: A Practical Guide by Peri Pakroo
Checking account approvals are usually not based on credit scores or credit reports from the 3 major bureaus.  Instead, banks often use a check verification service such as ChexSystems, Telecheck, or CCC.\n\nYour credit score will not affect your approval for the business checking account.  However, if you were to apply for a business loan, your credit score will definitely have an affect.\n\nIf you happen to be listed on ChexSystems, CreditServicer.com offers a free listing of banks that do not verify through ChexSystems.  This list is not only helpful to business owners, but also individuals who have records on ChexSystems.
Every other day?  Sounds like harassment...\n\nTell them that they are in violation of Federal Law (the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) because a) they need to provide you with a written statement of the debt they allege you owe and b) are calling you in a harassing manner.  Also inform them that you are recording every call you have with them.  \n\nDo not give them access to your bank accounts over the phone!  I wouldn't even give them my crdit card number.  Insist on a written, mailed statement.  \n\nJsut remember: if the debt collector is breathing, he's lying.
"Because so many 'work at home' opportunities are scams, frauds, or designed to make money - for the plan operators, not you - it's a good idea that before you invest time and especially money on any home-based business offers, you educate yourself on the different types of home work based schemes there are out there, and what to look for - and what to look out for - before making any commitment\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission offers several advisories about home-based business opportunities and network marketing (MLM) schemes.

Whatever makes you different from every other dynamic business that uses Internet technology. Are you better, cheaper, faster than your competition? Mostly depends on your market and what you are doing exactly. A business plan is a very important step, and you would need to add some more details to get a good enough answer to rely on.
No. You are financing the same amount either way. What it does is stick you with 15 days interest on the total principal. It adds a couple of hundred more dollars to the back end of the loan. It's like the way that car companies used to slide in a bunch of charges that you weren't expecting, like undercoating, dealer prep, etc.\n\nHowever, you should never borrow money to buy a car, anyway. Drive a piece of crap and make payments to yourself for a year. Move up to a better piece of crap and keep paying yourself for another year. Do this for the length of the average car loan, and you can have a brand new car, interest free, with no payments.\n\nWhat's in my wallet - CASH!

I'd suggest talking to your HR department, if you want to go that route.  You're likely to stir up some bru-ha-ha. Document times, dates, and content of the inappropriate interactions he has with you, because you will be asked to articulate your complaint.  ""My boss is mean to me"" isn't going to cut it.\n\nOther than that, about the only thing you can do is look for another job or post to another postion internally.

Yes and No. Really it will depend on local laws. Usually if a person is receiving mail at a residence for any period of time they are considered a tenant with legal rights. Technically they could not file eviction paperwork as you are not on a lease, unless you sublet, the owner would have to file the paperwork instead. If the owner were to file the paperwork it would have to be for all parties in the rental not just you. Long story short if you really want you have means of fighting it and dragging it out for a lengthy period of time.

I agree as well.  You should list all of them.  Employers want to understand your progression.  If those job are irrelevant to what you are applying for then just put the dates, job title or function, and city, state.  That should be enough to erase any initial doubts about what you did in life before that.  But be prepared to answer any questions about those roles and if they have any bearing on your abilities as an employee or how they shaped you as a person.

As with most health insurance questions, a lot depends on your personal situation, and finding affordable health insurance while you’re pregnant can be difficult. Do you or your spouse have access to insurance through work? If you’re self-employed, you might be able to find insurance through a trade association or trade guild. In both cases, you would be part of a group health plan, which cannot consider pregnancy a pre-existing condition. There may be a waiting period before the plan will cover your medical bills, though. Washington does have a Pregnancy Medical Program and a First Steps Program, which offer health care and coverage for low-income families.\n\nHowever, your best bet is to talk with local, WA-licensed health insurance agents. And I emphasize more than one because more agents working to earn your business means a better chance you’ll find the insurance policy that’s right for you and your family. MostChoice.com is a Web site that helps people interested in health insurance get in touch with state-licensed insurance agents. When you visit the site, you’ll also be able to view online rate quotes and policy descriptions from Washington insurance providers like Regence BlueCross BlueShield and Group Health Cooperative. Regence BCBS has a maternity program called “Special Beginnings” while Group Health Cooperative also offers maternity coverage.\n\nSo I’d visit MostChoice.com and have your questions ready for the agents that call you. There’s no cost or obligation, and your personal information is used only for the free quotes and to get you in touch with local area agents. \n\nYou can find it here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nBarnes@MostChoice.com

You are entitled to receive one free credit file disclosure every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies through the Central Source. It is entirely your choice whether you order all three credit file disclosures at the same time or order one now and others later. The advantage of ordering all three at the same time is that you can compare them. (However, you will not be eligible for another free credit file disclosure from the Central Source for 12 months.) On the other hand, the advantage of ordering one now and others later (for example, one credit file disclosure every four months) is that you can keep track of any changes or new information that may appear on your credit file disclosure. Remember, you are entitled to receive one free credit file disclosure through the Central Source every 12 months from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion – so if you order from only one company today you can still order from the other two companies at a later date\n\n  www.equifax.com\n  www.experian.com/fraud\n  www.transunion.com

I know how you feel. I am also sorta in your situation, my job gets really hectic sometimes and at first I was thinking about quitting because I am the new person I have been here for 10 months, and everyone here puts mostly all of the work off on me, but I have my own office and this is the most stable job  I have ever had, so I am sticking it out but still looking around for back up.  Life is to short to be un happy, and if you're like me then you have to do whatcha have to do to pay your bills.  So when you go to\nfeeling unwanted or uncomfortable, think of how it feels to be unemployed and broke you will change your mind and just think of your co-workers as non existent. You have to live for you and just keep on moving cuz' if you run now you'll never stop runnin' but by all means just try and stick it out and see if things change cuz it is not guaranteed that your next job will be better. Then if you feel as if you can't deal then move on.   Good Luck.

For you to mention patients it has occured to me that you are a doc or nurse right.  May I advise you that for as long as you are good at your work with your hands, you will have little people supporting for now but there will come a time when they will come to appreciate your work.  Wherever you will go, you will find such people who are jealous about co-workers and I dont know why even superiors tend to favour the lazy ones who are ever take lies to them.  You have conditions of service in organisation so follow what it says about breaking off. Wishing you all the best.

10% *safe* investments don't exist! In general the more risk you take the better the performance *might* be.\n\nThat said the best you can do is a mix. \nSuppose you have 1000 dollars. \nPut 800 into CDs. One can get about 4%/year on those. So in five years the 800 dollars will grow to 1000 dollars. This guarantees your capital.\nPut the other 200 dollars into a stock index fund, or better buy an index tracker. After five years this investment will have made *on average*  7%/year. It could be much less, or much more, this is the joker part of your investment. In practice you will have something between 150 and 350 dollars.\n\nSo after five years the 1000 dollar will have grown into something between 1150 and 1350 dollars.   \n\nIf you want more risk, change the 80-20 mix to 60-40 or 50-50.\nYour capital is no longer guaranteed, but your chances to gain more increase.
In short, it is an agreement or a promise.

A contract needs to be in writing and signed to be binding. Who's to say that you didn't create the e-mail and send it to yourself.\n\nIn California, your lease agreement automatically becomes a month to month contract if the lease expires and is not renewed and you pay July's rent and it is accepted.\n\nYou're not responsible for finding a tennant and you're doing her a favor by doing so. However, here is how I would approach it:\n\nI would tell her (via phone and through a certified letter) that you plan on leaving August 15th and you're willing to pay rent till August 15th. You're also willing to be flexible when showing the place to potential tennants. You'll even place free ads on the web and at your workplace to help her out. Tell her that she can use your cell phone number as a contact in any of the newspaper ads that she places and pays for to facilitate the renting process. Do not sign any lease or document that states that you're responsible for rent beyond August 15th.\n\nNow while you're talking to her on the phone and if she refuses, it's time to play hardball (do not put this in writing).Tell her because of the financial stress of finding another place till August 15th, the alternative would be for you not to pay July's rent, not to sign anything and not be flexible in showing the place. Tell her that she will need to evict you and you will fight it in court. Tell her that she might win, but it will cost her money and time and you are willing to put everything into a storage and rent a room for a month or stay at your cousin's house once you are evicted. \n\nYou're basically making her an offer that she can't refuse. Also, if you lose the eviction, your deposit will be used to pay July's rent and you just need to pay for the days up until you got evicted. \n\nI own a few rental properties in California and if I was a renter, I would approach it in that manner.\n\nGood Luck

typically you would want your result to be greater than the investment.  You can make an investment and have no results or negative results. You would calculate each separately.  The investment is whatever amount of money/time/labor you put into the project.  The result would be revenues or sales, number of people in attendance, increased awareness of a product, reduced costs, etc.  There can be lots of different results.  If you want to calculate ROI, then the investment and return have to be the same measure.  For example, the investment is $10,000 for an event sponsorship and you had 20 people attend the event.  Those 20 people each represent $1,000 worth of sales, so the return is $20,000 in sales.  The ROI is 20,000 divided by 10,000 or 200%.

No, you do not need to be certified. From my experience in starting my consulting firm, everyone claims to be an expert, but they don't know what they are talking about. In about 6 months, you will know more than all of the books put together. So don't sweat it. It just is not that important.\n\nNo, you do not need a business plan. Whoever told you that you needed one is wrong. Business plans are primarily used to get financing from a bank, which you are not going to get for a service business. Since this is only going to be a micro busniess venture, you will spend more time updating your spreadsheets than using the plan. Since you plan on transitioning from a full-time job to this, you are set financially. Don't let this bogus requirement get you down.\n\nYou do need a marketing plan. For your business, I would strongly recommend Guerilla Marketing by Jay Conrad Levinson. Pick a few marketing techniques that you are comfortable with and go at it. Just off the top of my head, I would have business cards, web site, stationery, flyers, and attend networking events. Your potential clients should include salesman (notoriously disorganized), real estate agents, insurance agents, independent consultants, and executives who want an assistant but their company won't let them hire one directly. You want to be marketing regularly. Again, GM by Levinson is perfect for you.\n\nIf I was looking for a virtual assistant, I would only be interested in references and a client list. Having stated that, your first priority should be to define what exactly you are willing to do? Payroll, travel arrangements, online research, telemarketing, etc.  Once you have an idea of what you will do, I would make up a cost sheet and a list of references. Since you do not have any clients, use personal references. The only other question I have that your clients would share is how well are you going to help me when you have a full-time job.\n\nAlthough I do not use VA's, I know small business owners that swear by them. I also know that there were times when I was stuck in an airport that I would have loved having someone to call  who could get me the hell out of there or arrange a hotel or something.  \n\nBest of luck to you.

Well, think about what you enjoy doing, even if it doesn't typically turn into a career. What were your favorite subjects in school? What are your hobbies? Figure out what you like to do outside of work, and then figure out a creative way to use that talent in a career. \n\nFor example, if you love working out, try working for a company that manufactures athletic gear, or as a personal trainer. Some of your ideas may require going back to school or getting a license, but do it anyways. It'll be more than worth it when you're happy with what you're doing!

Customers will be able to find and refer others to it in the future. \n\nSince any names that are suggested here may already be owned by another party, I wanted to go a different route...\n\nI suggest either hiring a name creation firm or get together with your friends and/or family and throw a ""name party"" & have everyone bounce some ideas around. Compile a listing of names that you like the best. Once you have that list, do as much free research as you can before you delve into comprehensive research. I listed some links where you can do some preliminary name checking. However, please be aware that this is merely scratching the surface of what's out there. Only comprehensive research will tell you if the name is truly available. But, these links are free & a great place to start, so I'd try them out first. \n\nThere are other sites that offer free searching capabilities in conjunction with their commercial services, so I'm not able to post those links due to the Yahoo! TOS. You'll also want to check domain names & yellow pages, so simply do a search for ""free domain name search"" and ""national yellowpages"" and the appropriate links will pop up.\n\nHope that helps!

Yeah, take the week off. Let it heal.
Yes.   Inflation basically boils down to that money today is worth more than it is tomorrow.  As inflation goes up, the value of the debt decreases.  So you are paying off the same amount of debt, but it is worth less.   That's why when inflation goes up, interest rates go up - to compensate the creditor for the lost value.\n\nGenerally, wages go up with the rate of inflation...but the amount of your debt does not.  So while the buying power of a single dollar is less, your total buying power (hopefully) stays the same.  \n\nOf course, no one wants hyper inflation.  But it is a great way to get out of debt.

"Don't worry about other people judging you. Your income and debt has nothing to do with you being irresponsible. The fact that you are trying to do something about it, that to me shows absolute responsibility. The good thing is that there are financial counselors out there who are willing to listen to your situation and make recommendations that best fit your needs. In my opinion your best option is to contact these counselors to seek out your options.\n\nThes programs are known as debt management programs and here's how they basically work:\n\n1) You have lots of high interest debt. Perhaps the high interest rates are making it very difficult for you to make any progress. So what do you do?\n2) You call a credit couneling company. I can't speak for all companies, but the ones interested in the consumers show care and compassion because they understand you are in a difficult situation. This is sometimes all someone needs. Someone to just listen to, but if the counselor finds that a debt consolidation WILL help, then they will walk you step by step through the program. Okay so you qualify now what? \n3) You enroll your high interest debt into the program and the company will begin contacting your creditors to negotiate lower interest rates on most of your accounts. This is a tremendous help because interest consumes most of your monthly payment anyways. Another important thing that you have to remember is that the creditors also CLOSE your accounts. This is to further help you along in paying off your debts. But what do you have to do?\n4) You stay in contact with your consolidation company and creditors. But you only make ONE payment to the consolidation company, who in turn forward it to your creditors. Then what?\n5) Sit back and watch your debt slowly disappear! Regardless of the debt, it typically takes a person 4-5 years to pay off your debt. As each account is paid off, your payment is then redistributed among the remaining accounts. It's a snowballing effect, where the payments to your creditors get larger as each account is paid off. \n\nIn choosing a company you also want to look for these things:\n\n1) A company who is genuinely trying to help consumers: A company who is looking for the consumer's best interests will not only counsel you, but they may take you through a budget, analyze your situation, provide free financial material, etc. In other words they don't just try to enroll you. You should never feel pressured.\n2) A company who is non-profit, certified, and has a good track record with the BBB. A company who is non-profit may ask for a donation but it is purely voluntary. All your payments should go to your creditors. Also there are regulation agencies in place to weed out the ""shady"" companies, so you should make sure they are certified and a responsible member of the BBB.\n3) A company that answers all your questions and whose counselors are also certified. You probably have lots of questions, but a caring and knowledgable counselor will walk you through step by step, and explain thoroughly every step of the process and its affects on your credit.\n\nThe reason I am a big fan of this method is because I myself am on a debt management program and I was once a financial counselor! My overall experience is a smooth one and it probably has something to do with the fact that I saw how the DMP (debt management program) worked behind the scenes. As far as my debt goes, in about 18 months, I have gone from $14000 debt, to about $8500. That's a big leap for me, and it's only going to get better as the payments get larger when accounts begin to close. It's a great system and more people need to take advantage of the great opportunity creditors have given consumers through the DMP. My credit score wasn't bad to begin with but it has increased from 695 to 723.\n\nSo if you are interested in the company I worked for, it is http://www.incharge.org . It is based in Orlan"

Maybe.  It's feasible if 1) you like HOW they market, 2) you follow their process.  The critical part of any MLM is to get people to do the same thing over and over again.  This usually means there are a lot of rallys and sometimes inauthentic pep talks.  What's happening is people are replacing what large corporations have to pay to accomplish.  So, if I were Nestle, I'd have a very large marketing and advertisiting budget to tell people to buy Nestle Hot Chocolate.  But, if I'm Stevens, I get a bunch of people to tell their friends and family tht this is the best hot chocolate made in the world.  If I were to trade my time to do that, I'd get paid for that.  I'd also get paid for anyone else I've gotten to do that with me.  \n\nSo, it makes sense.  It works, if you work it.  What are the drawbacks?  I've looked into a few, and found that I can't keep my dignity and do these things.  I am a thinking person, and thinking is not allowed with these groups.  They want you to follow the formula, kind of like a drone in a bee hive. \n\nAlso, a lot of these groups don't have a lot of credibility.  Face it, you hang out with a lot of people that are kind of like you.  In an MLM, a lot of people aren't like you.  When you bring people like you to meet with people not like you, they wonder if you're like them.  In a typical business arrangement, Nordstrom shoppers don't mix with thrift store shoppers, and so nobody questions whether the store can meet their needs.  MLMs mix up the people in a way that favors people who believe in the lottery, but don't invest in their own education.  \n\nLast thought: I know a lot of dignified and successful people who have worked in MLMs.  Some of these have incredible wealth, and they did it on the merits of their labor, not on anything else.  It's a way to level the playing field.  \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck

"Yes, I have heard of Goji Juice, I market it. I have checked out the website you listed and would have to agree with the fact that people who claim it will ""Cure"" cancer, aids, etc. are in direct violation of the company terms.  It is a ridiculous statement not to mention extremely detrimental to the rest of us who are marketing this product.\nBUT!  Let me add that the New Zealand News was also to blame for slandering this company.  Their claim that Goji has a high sugar content is completely unfounded!  I can back that with scientific evidence.  The lie that it is sending diabetics to emergency is also ridiculous.  You will note on your article and video on that site, that nowhere does it state that anyone in New Zealand tested it!  There is substantial proof on pubmed.org under the heading Lycium Barbarum that what they are saying is totally untrue.\nThe only claim we make is that Goji can help with diabetes. This tiny red fruit has been used in China for the treatment of diabetes for many years, and it's polysaccharides have been shown to help balance blood sugar and insulin response.  It also contains betaine, which can prevent fatty liver disease and vascular damage often seen in diabetics.  Goji also assists in weight loss by enhancing the conversion of food into energy instead of fat, and it increases exercise tolerance, stamina and endurance.  All of this is backed with medical evidence.\nOf course when someone starts making outrageous claims and the media gets a hold of it, they are able to tear it to shreds in minutes,  which is exactly what they did here.\nI did not hear of one Doctor in New Zealand who tested it and showed any scientific evidence to the contrary (where the sugar is concerned).  I spoke to Dr. Earl Mindell personally....he is the one who made this discovery, he is a Pharmacist, Master Herbalist and world renowned nutritionist who is also the author of the Vitamin Bible.  I asked him specifically about diabetes and glucose content because I have 2 diabetics in my home who I love dearly.  I would hardly give them the juice knowing there was any glucose content!  Dr. Mindell assured me there is a trace of glucose in each bottle, not enough to even give consideration to.  He also assured me that the health benefits would be apparent in approximately 3 months of taking the juice.\nI am satisfied with the evidence at Pubmed and The Chinese Oncologists reports that this product does indeed go to work on all auto-immune deficiencies and I will continue to market it based on what I have personally seen it do.  \nMaybe you should contact Freelife International and ask what their opinion is on all of this.  We do expect some negative feedback, as with any product, but I think most educated people would see that someone had made unreasonable claims and the media frenzy that follows only fans the flames.  I have many customers and that video would never be enough to change their minds on consuming this product for what it actually does.  They are satisfied with what it has done for them, including the 2 diabetics in my home who are seeing their blood sugar balanced for the first time in years, that they will continue to take it.  \nMillions of people can't be just imagining the benefits!\n\n\nDragondaddy!

"The mortgagee ( the lender / bank ) has the right to file a suit for a deficiency judgment for any loss suffered.  However, because of the situation, this is very rarely done.  Normally, they would win the suit but then how do they collect ?  If a person has lost a property through foreclosure, it isn't very likely that they are collectible.  But, if a person does have other assets and the lender knows about it,  they may file for a deficiency judgment.  If one is in the situation of possibly being foreclosed, it is usually better to sell the property and pay off the mortgage or discuss with the lender the possibility of a ""deed in lieu of foreclosure""."

I think it depends on what kind of business you are interested in starting. Will you be selling something on-line (i.e. retailer) or will it be for information (possibly for a brick and mortar)? \n\nIMO an on-line retail site would be more difficult to set up, but it is possible for you to run and host it. I use 'DreamHost' which has the ability to host your site and set up retailer shopping carts. \n\nAn Information site will be easy, since all you have to do is create pages telling about your services, and include contact information - either an email or an on line form someone can fill out. \n\nAs for hiring someone, that will cost some money to create, design, and host. In addition you will need to go back to them from time to time in order to make changes. In NYC a freelancer can charge anywhere from $25/hr and up; plus hosting costs.

what the?
Interest is most certainly a cash expense.  The reason you add interest expense back is to compare apples to apples.  The simplified cash flow calculation is Net Income plus Interest Expense plus Depreciation Expense (there also might be some other oddball add-backs which I will ignore).  Now you can compare cash flow to principal and interest payments.\n\nIf you didn't add back interest, you would be double counting.\n\nHope this helps.

Many of these positions are on commission and the best way to make the most money is working on commission. It is a sales position and I have always said that sales is the highest paid hard work and lowest paid easy work. You might not make much in the beginning but if you are a risk taker, commission is much better.
"So you want to raise funds for your group by having a raffle. Here are some questions that you probably should ask yourself:\n\n - How much money do you want to raise?\n - How much money do you want to spend to raise the amount in the first question?\n - Who will be likely to buy raffle tickets?\n -  How many raffle tickets do we expect to sell?\n\nMany local businesses might be willing to donate merchandise or services as prizes for your raffle in exchange for some advertising. If you are thinking of having lots of small to medium prizes, check with your local Starbucks - they often will give out gift cards for groups as raffle prizes. Also check with smoothie places. For nicer prizes, perhaps companies can donate items for gift baskets - like movie tickets or spa coupons or fancy snacks or gift cards to different local stores. For really high-end prizes, check with car dealerships for cars or travel agents for travel packages.\n\nOnce you have a grand prize or set of prizes, you can price the tickets - perhaps $1 for a chance to win something in the $10-$50 range or upwards of $25 for a chance to win a trip or a car. If you are selling $1 tickets, you can probably get by with just having a cashbox at a booth and a roll of tickets, and just have ""must be present when the number is announced to win"". but for high end prizes, you should probably be able to accept checks, make special custom tickets, and get full contact information for ticket buyers, to let them know if they win.\n\nLocal businesses love to say that they give back to the community, and one way they do that is to donate stuff for community and school groups that raffle off the the stuff for fundraisers. So check with your local businesses - perhaps you might be raffling movie tickets or gift cards for the mall or an iPod or a weekend trip for two to a local resort. make sure you raffle off something that people want. if people aren't interested in your prize, they might not be willing to buy a ticket.\n\ngood luck!"

You're going to want to handle a few things here.  You've got to establish yourself legally as a distributor, which probably involves incorporating or at least setting up an LLC.  (You don't want the personal risk of a shipment going south, do you?)  \n\nSecond, you're going to want to establish distribution fulfillment (how long does it take to get things here, what choices do clients have, what terms are you willing to provide, what kind of shipping insurance, etc. are you putting together to make this a predictable process?)\n\nNext, you're going to want to establish a business presence.  The large retail organization will have buyers: professionals that choose what's going to be in a certain season or promotion's lineup.  You've got to get them the goods, interface with them, and meet their expectations.\n\nI'd recommend one general book for your process: The New Conceptual Selling.  You're going to want to manage client expectations and go through a fact-finding process with them that's going to match their win with your ability to fulfill it.  \n\nI'd also recommend that you meet one or two buyers before investing too much into the business.  You can explain your position and get an actual buyer to teach you at least a few pointers.  Once you get those pointers down, you will be well-enough grounded to actually start the conceptual sales cycle with potential clients.\n\nWhen you're finally to this point, you're going to buy a list of buyers (infousa.com is a reputable source) and prospect them in a regular, cyclical way.  Prospecting Your Way to Sales Success by Bill Good is a great approach to this.  (Kind of a cheesy book, but still the best one I've found out there.)  \n\nThis is probably a very good business for you to get into if you have reliable sources and know what they can safely deliver for you.  Be sure you are delivering what you're selling, and you'll build a business for yourself.\n\nOne alternative approach you can take is to do the same thing with designers (usually out of New York).  These guys are going to drive the biggest retail companies' buy decisions.  For these, you'd position yourself as a direct-factory resource for whatever they're designing.  They'll have exacting standards of quality, materials, textile treatments, delivery times, sizes, etc.  They'd probably be a much more steady source of revenue for you, once you establish yourself with them.\n\nGood luck!
You should use the website I use....you can start with a free account and once you start getting jobs you can upgrade.

Thats not true, its not being conceided if you feel positive about yourself.  Its just like any other job.

I would favor the employer-matched 401K because it is free money and it reduces your current tax burden.Employer matching typically maxes out at some amount, so put in at least that much in order to get the most free money from them.Those extra funds will help your 401K grow faster throughout the life of the account.
The ISC gives you some knowledge of the internet systems but know practical skills.  You can probably get an entry job with state government working with a systems analyst.  I'd network with local company IT directors to see what might be available.\n\nAs for part II, a CAT exam is not necessary to get an MBA from an accredited university.  You should submit your scores to an accepting school along with scores from the GMAT exam.

A lease or tenancy is an interest in personal property or real property given by a lessor to another person (usually called the lessee or tenant) for a fixed period of time, and the lessee obtains exclusive possession of the property in return for paying the lessor a fixed or determinable consideration.\n\nIn law, there are two types of property:\n\nReal property is land or any permanent feature or structure above or below the surface. Ownership of land is an aspect of the system of real property or realty in common law systems (immovables in civil law systems and Conflict of Laws). \nAll other property is considered personal property or personalty in common law systems (movables in civil law and Conflict of Laws), and this property is either tangible or intangible, i.e. it is either physical property that can be touched like a computer, or it is an enforceable right like a patent or other form of intellectual property. \nThere are three separate levels of rights or interests affecting both forms of property. In descending order of importance they are:\n\nownership, \npossession or \ncontrol and use. \nThe legal documents that transfer these rights are respectively: conveyance/transfer, lease/tenancy, and bailment/pledge for tangible personalty, assignments and licenses for intangibles.

"Only as a road map, not necessarily to be followed.\n\nIn my experience with business plans, their main benefit is to help you think through the business before you start. It forces you to research the market, to know what to expect, the obstacles you will face. It is one thing to say ""I want to start a clothing store"" and another to be confronted with the realities of how to find manufacturers, how to get your clothing line to the stores, how will you compete, the question of production, the finances you  will need, etc.\n\nThe trouble with business plan stems from the assumptions you will make -- especially in the financial section. One of the common mistakes of entrepreneurs is to depict a very rosy prospect for their business -- which is fine, if it is true. They think they will sell this much; they think they can accomplish this much; they think they can do all the marketing plans they've thought of; they think that they can get the financing they want. Then they start the business and find that the demand for their products is not what they anticipated; hence their revenue and sales figures fall short of what they assumed in the business plan. \n\nBusiness plans end up useless because of the erroneous assumptions made. More so with a dynamic, changeable business.\n\nDo a business plan mainly for the purpose of getting financing."
Each person must find their own path to follow. Once on that path, they must accept the pitfalls as well as the treasures.\n\nI, personally, am a person that finds treasures in life, i.e. birds, trees, people, etc. I appreciate having money but not to the expense of losing my treasures.
bankruptcy is a legal filing where you declare you are unable to pay your creditors. there are different types of bankruptcy and if you go this route you need to do some SERIOUS HOMEWORK and be DAMNED CAREFUL. A bankruptcy can stay on your record from 7-11 years depending on what you file. there are a ton of websites, books and lawyers who can assist you. I'd also ask free legal clinics. One other better route for you is  consolidation where you can end up paying half or less of what you owe without screwing up your credit. PLEASE do your homework first and THINK before you do anything!!\n\nVin

You answered your own question by asking it.  Most housing near usf is around $700.  You can get a 1 bed for around $625 in Springwood, I lived in Oak Ramble for a while and paid $575 for a 1 bed, you can sometimes find a 2 bed in The Oaks for $700, there are 1 beds in Campus Walk for $575...you just need to go to the area directly north of campus, between 42nd and 46th street and start shopping, it's on the bus route, so that will also help if you don't have a car, or don't want to pay for a parking pass for campus

Goals are the targets that we establish. We need both personal and professional goals. Without goals we have no direction or structure in our lives. Without goals we can not measure success or failure. We need both short term, ie, daily, weekly,and monthly goals as well as long term goals. Annual and longer.If you do not have well written, well thought out goals in your life, you will waste so much of your time living without direction. I would encourage everyone to write down their goals and record their success in attaining these .
"Business intelligence involves collecting quite a bit of information and analyzing it. Many business use tools to achieve this. A few of the data tools are data modeling, data warehouses, and data mining. Data tools help employees collect the data and analyze it efficiently. Data tools are for organizational purposes mostly. Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is used in the analyzing process. OLAP is sometimes simply referred to as Analytics, which is based on the hypercube or ""cube"" and dimensional analysis.\n\nSome businesses also use software vendors for BI tools. There are quite a few enterprises offering BI technology. If a business does not get the BI tools themselves, then software vendor will provide a business with tools, and sometimes software support and BI professionals who will help the company analyze results and collect data. Some companies providing BI software are Siebel Systems, Microsoft, Altius Consulting, Business-Soft, and SAS Institute.\n\nFor more info read this site http://www.wareprise.com/articles/business-intelligence-101.php"

Of course you will take a loss on it, but that's the price you pay when you don't read all of the fine print on such a major sale.

"Payday loan services are worse than loan sharks.  Do NOT get one of those.  Because there is a limit on the interest rate a financing entity can charge, they get around it by charging ""service fees"" instead.  You can end up paying 50% interest on your money with those outfits.  At some point, the government will wake up and shut them down.  Until then, the only way to try to get rid of them is to not use them.\n\nIf you need some extra cash, getting a job might be a good idea."
The license will be anywhere from $10,000 to $150,000 or more, depending on where you are.  Budget for 6 months lease (sign a longer lease but have enough money in the bank to cover 6 months). Inventory to open will be another $2000-10,000 or more. If you want to sell food, add another $2000-20,000 to your licensing fees.  Furnishings, equipment... that may come with the space, or you pay for it.  Payroll for the first 2-4 months.  Business insurance will be $5000-20,000 or more per year. City and state business permits, tax certifications and all the other various licenses, permits and such will be another $2000-10,000.\n\nMore important are your costs for the first 2 years or so. Most new restaurants and bars don't break even in the first year. That means it costs more to be open than you bring in. So you'll be covering the shortfalls yourself as the owner--- particularly the liquor bills and payroll.  And remember, as the owner, you're not on the payroll. Your staff gets paid before you do.  And a lot of first-time owners don't factor that in, which is why 50% of these new businesses fail in the first year and only about 20% make it to the 5th year (search for Nation's Restaurant News, they have an online magazine somewhere with all these statistics).\n\nYou can make a lot of money owning a bar but it takes a while to get there. In the DC area where I live, it's well over $150,000 just to open the doors. In a rural area you may be able to do it on $50,000. But make sure you double your estimate, so once you open, you can cover the bills, till you start making money.

"I am a former financial counselor for a consolidation firm in Orlando so I can answer your question. Whenever you get a settlement offer from a collection agency or a creditor, you have to way the pro's and con's of your decisions. Two big factors determine your credit score: 35% is payment history, and 30% is overall debt. Based on these two factors, by making a setlement you're score will increase somewhat because you are satisfying the debt with that creditor, but may not increase as much as if you paid off the entire debt completely. Score may not be your only concern, because future lenders will see the special status of settlement for this debt which lenders frown upon. It's as if you borrowed $100 from a friend and only decided to pay him/her back $60! It satisfies your friend who you owed the money that they got anything back at all, but don't go asking other friends for money, you already have a reputation! \n\nSo in summary, if your financial situation only allows you to pay a settled amount, then by all means pay it. That collector at least will stop calling your house asking for money (PS make sure to get the offer in writing as described above). But remember this, negative credit history can remain on your credit report for a length of 7-10 years. Or your other alternative is to slowly pay off the debt by making smaller payments. If it's with a collection agency, then they probably aren't charging interest and you are already used to their collection tactics. You may be able to pay it off sooner than 7-10 years, and remember they will show ""satisfied"" on your report instead of ""settled"" which is much better."
Some of the most common mistakes employers make concern inquiries into an applicant's medical history--such as asking whether the applicant ever filed a worker's compensation or disability claim or has ever been hospitalized, and if so, for what condition. The Americans With Disabilities Act strictly prohibits employers from asking applicants any questions that would reveal whether an applicant has a mental or physical disability. Employers should provide the applicant with the essential job functions of the position applied for and inquire whether the applicant can perform those essential job functions with or without a reasonable accommodation.
It's better to make money before you move than to move without money, so I'd recommend taking two jobs for the rest of the time you're in Orlando. Not only will your bank account grow, but you'll spend a lot of time away from the home, which leaves you less time to fight with your ex. Also look at what you are planning to bring on the move with you; household items like dishes and furniture can often be more expensive to move than to replace when you are settled in.  Sell everything you don't absolutely need to bring with you; you may not become rich off of a yard sale but you'll have some more cash and less stuff which makes for easier travel.\n\nIf your goal is to simply be closer to your daughter rather than live with her in NJ, look into Delaware, especially the Wilmington area, for a place to live. Wilmington is experiencing a great phase of growth right now so you may earn more there than you expect, and the cost of living is still fairly reasonable.  It's just about an hour or so on the Amtrak from Wilmington to NYC so it's pretty close to NJ.

People tend to have more credit today and to shop for credit - via the internet and other channels-more frequently than ever.  FICO scores reflect this reality.  However, research shows that opening several credit accounts in a short period of time does represent greater risk - especially for people who do not have a long established credit history.\n\nMultiple credit requests also represent greater credit risk.  However, FICO scores do a good job of distinguishing between a search for many new credit accounts and rate shopping for one new account.  Your FICO score takes into account:\n\n1) How many new accounts you have.  Your FICO score looks at how many new accounts you have by type of account (for example, how many newly opened credit cards you have).  It also may look at how many of your accounts are new accounts.\n2) How long it has been since you opened a new account.  Your FICO score may consider this information for specific types of accounts.\n3) How many recent requests for credit you have made, as indicated by inquiries to the credit reporting agencies.  Inquiries remain on your credit report for two years, although FICO scores only consider inquiries from the last 12 months.  FICO scores have been carefully designed to count only those inquiries that truly impact credit risk.\n4) Length of time since credit report inquiries were made by lenders.\n\nSo in summary, if it's been some time since your last new line of credit was opened, or you last applied for a dept store card, opening and promptly closing a new account will more than likely not dramatically impact your score. On the other hand, if you plan on doing this regularly, I would recommend just waiting for the store sales to get that extra 15% off. Good luck!
You are a consultant if someone will pay you to consult with them.  Be careful, however, and avoid stepping over the line.  If you are going to be selling stock or real estate or insurance in the guise of consulting, you need to be licensed.  But pure consulting in any field is generally not licensed (and also usually not worth anything).

"There are two kinds of ""couriers"" in the sense that you mean.  One is the ""occasional,"" who has been checked out and had a bond written and can be called at any time with an offer of an assignment by companies that provide this service.\n\nThe other is as a uniformed courier in full-time employment with a service company.  If I am not mistaken, and it's quite possible I am, one of the firms that offers this service is Wells Fargo.\n\nYou need to have a clean criminal record, be able to pass a pre-employment drug test as well as surprise tests at any time while working, and a decent financial situation (that is, not be in or at the very verge of bankruptcy).  There are other qualifications, too.  It helps to have a current passport and for overseas assignments have a current immunization schedule as well as the ability to read, speak and write another language.  Above all, it is important to dress neatly and without calling attention to yourself, be well-groomed and use reasonable manners.\n\nCheck the newspapers in major cities - especially Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C.  Their classified ads columns on Sunday usually have ads for couriers.  Today you can see most of those online and it is really tons easier searching the ads that way.\n\nAlso look in the Yellow Pages for companies that provide courier services - and best of all, call the local offices of airline cargo departments.  They can tell you which companies are active nearby and perhaps even whom to call about this."

"First answer's got the right idea. Since this *is* for a house, you want as little risk as possible. Unfortunately, that usually means low rates of return. However, in your case, I would strongly advise against putting the money into stocks and mutual funds: you'll probably need every penny you've saved, and all it would take would be one wrong decision to put you back at square one.\nCheck with your local bank; most places offer higher interest rates as balances go up.\nNow, my questions are, how firm is that year and can you avoid dipping into the savings while you wait? If the answer is ""very"", and ""yes"", go with a Certificate of Deposit. Most banks offer a significantly higher interest rate on a CD compared to a regular savings and even most Money Market accounts (I've seen anywhere from 20% to 300% better retruns on CD vs. MM). And (again depending on the bank's minimum deposit requirements), you may be able to split that up into different CDs; say, 15,000 in a 6-month and 15,000 in a 12-month. That way, in 6 months, you can reevaluate your situation, and either roll the 6-month over, or cash it out.\nAnother solution, though one to be wary of, is finding a reputable online bank. Online banks don't have the overhead costs of a traditional brick and mortar bank, and can offer higher rates of return. One reputable online bank offers a 4.25% APY for a basic savings account, compared to the 0.95 APY I can get at a local bank. The only downside to this is the turnaround time, a deposit to from your online account to the linked checking/MM/savings account usually takes a day or two."
Nothing is for certain, but if you can handle all of the tasks of a small business owner and do so successfully, you already have a lot of what it takes to succeed in the corporate world.\n\nThe only thing that might be a barrier is what most folks look at as a positive:  your past experience being the boss.\n\nMost corporate leaders have to answer to others, whether it be higher ups or stockholders.  Some small business owners cringe at the thought of having to have a boss.
You have three options.\n1) Rent from an individual who will not run a credit/background check.  Of course if they own more than one unit (i.e. apartments instead of a house) you risk having neighbors who have done gods-only-know-what because 99% of the time the criminal background check is done with the credit check.\n2) Go to public housing, but I thought you said no dumps....\n3) Admit up front what the issues are and keep looking until you find a property manager who is willing to work with you.  You may be required to put down an additional deposit, but it won't be as bad as other options.  If you chose to do this option, MAKE SURE you talk to the property manager, not an assistant or a leasing agent as they are not authorized (generally speaking) to make those kinds of decisions.\n\nMy family was in a similar situation a few months ago but thankfully we found a community that had just emptied due to renovations and was trying to lease up again fast.  The manager was willing to work with us because she needed the occupancy.
In theory because they have the highest skills, the most experience, the most responsibility, and they make the final decisions.\n\nIt is a nice theory, but debatable.
Put everything into a box.  Pack it just as you will be sending it and then to estimate the weight, first weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding the box.  (Weight will be B - A) If it's more than 10 lbs you are going to be better off shipping by UPS or DHL.  They have websites you can go to and calculate shipping based on weight and dimensions of the box.  \nWhen you list it on eBay you can use a shipping calculator that will give your bidders their shipping cost based on the weight you enter and your location when they enter their location.  \n$150 sounds like too much to me, but it all depends on how much it all weighs and the size of the box.\nCheck my website for eBay selling help:\nhttp://www.themainsail.net/helppg.html\nI also have links for help with shipping and packing.\nGood luck.

"NO.  IN most cases you can still owe money.  Your house was merely the security for the loan.  Lenders are in the business to make money - ""forgiveness"" is not usually a business term.  \n\nExample:\n\nLets say you had a mortgage for $100,000.  When you made your payments you mostly paid the interest so at the time of the foreclosure you owned $97,000 on the loan you signed.  \n\nAfter it is foreclosed the bank/lender sells the house for $85,000.  \n\n     $97,000  (amount you promised to pay)\n -     85,000  (amount the lender got for selling the house)\n____________\n     $12,000   (the amount still owning on the note you signed)\n\nThey can sue you to recoup the amount they lost.\n\nAlso, when a house is foreclosed the house now ""belongs"" to the Lender.  It is no longer your house.  If the bank sells the house for a profit (more than you owe) they keep the difference.  After all, they just sold THEIR house."

If you want to become rich, now is the best time to do it, but don't expect immediate results. You are more passionate about things than older people, and that is a good thing. That's what gives you drive, but be careful not to gamble and make calculated decisions. I would go to college to educate yourself and learn how to set goals and achieve them(plus, there's a lot of chic's). Most people don't realize that education is actually an act of leisure, in an economic theory way. But there is also higher earning potential. And I mean potential, not a guarentee. My friends didn't go to college, but instead picked up a trade or license(ex: selling insurance...) and they make more than myself who has graduated.

"I work for a staffing firm and may be able to give you some advice. \n\n1) If you are sending in your resume to openings it's probably buried underneath a pile of hundreds of resumes on someone's desk (or on someone's inbox if you emailed it). Sometimes the postings are also just formalities. Some companies have a policy of posting their open jobs even though they already have someone in mind for the position. \n\n2) Post your resume online. You may have already done this, but you can't just post it and assume it's being viewed. You have to understand the nature of these resume search engines. When employers search for resumes online, the ""newest"" resumes come up first. So if you posted your resume yesterday, your resume will probably come up in the second or third page, and some employers don't even get there. Make it a habit to ""refresh"" your resume every morning. Change something in it. Something. Anything. Add a word, change a word, add a punctuation mark, whatever. Just change something and hit save. The search engine will then think it's a ""new"" posting and will come up on top of searches increasing your visibility to potential employers. \n\n3) Network. A lot of jobs are filled via referrals. Depending on your industry, attend professional events, visit exhibits, collect business cards. Use online social networking sites like LinkedIn, Zero Degrees, or Ryze. \n\n4) Depending on where you are and what you do, I may be able to help you out. :)"
It's always hard to leave school and hit the working world.  I'm suprised that your school didn't have guidance councelors or anyone helping you figure out how to get a job after you graduate.  It's also normal to be scared and unsure at this point.\n\nI know we had information that said what we should do to help us get jobs.  They said if you didn't have practical experience in your field you should somehow manage to get it.  Work part-time in your field, get an internship while still in school and  volunteer somewhere that would count towards your field.\n\nYou may have to move elsewhere to get a job and/or start with a really low wage until you get the experience you need.  I'd see if your school has a placement agency or someone who could advise you better on what would help you get a job.  Also ask your instructor for advice.\n\nGood luck :)

"It does depend on the state you live in.  Best bet is to file wills and have your name put on the deed w/rights of survivorship.  You can actually file these yourself in the county courthouse.  Don't let a lawyer charge you too much for this.  It's a very simple process.\n\nAnd it's called ""dower"".  Not all states have it.  You co-signed on the second loan, and therefore are responsible for the loan, though not the home itself (you couldn't file your own mortgage - this also varies by state)."

"IN THE HOOD BUT SELL IT FOR CHEAP.Your question about what happens to stolen diamonds is very good.\n\nThe answer is that it is very varied. I would think that what happens to them depends on the knwoledge of the thief.\n\nAn inscription on a diamond is sort of a redlight to the knowledgeable theif. It tells them that this diamond needs to have it's inscription polished off. It also is a notification to a very experienced thief that in order to avoid detection by ""cert matching""the diamond may require re-cutting. \n\nIn thefts where a lot of diamonds are stolen, such as a Fedex type robbery or a large robbery, where they are inscribed, chances are that the thieves are well versed in how to avoid detection of the stones stolen, and have connections to get the diamonds altered enough to avoid that.\n\nFor diamonds that are not inscribed, but do have GIA lab reports, there is in their computer database a way to match a diamond. This was done many years ago, so they could tell if they graded the same diamond previously. Unfortunately, the primary use of this is for their information only, and it isn't set up to be a way to identify stolen diamonds. From what I've been told about the system, it bascially works using a 3 D plot of the inclusions, although there could be other methodology used. They do keep this information very confidentia, and firther I do not know how effective it is in matching stones that are recutl. \n\nGemprint on the other hand is very active and cooperative with law enforcement agencies both local, national and internation in helping to recover and match any diamond they feel is likely to have been stolen that is recovered from pawn shops, jewelry buyers, smugglers etc. And of course most recently terrorists, as stolen diamond trafficing provides them with funding, and of course ""blood/conflict diamonds.\n\nThere is also the Jewelers Security Alliance group that is very experienced in assisting recovery and providing law enforcement with various types of information not only about the stones stolen, but they also provide personal files for those that do participate in stolen trafficing of diamonds, and Gemprint does have a very active part in assisting them. The scope of illegal activity also addresses smuggling of stones as well.\n\nBut very few diamond theives are really educated and have the connections to have diamonds recut. Many don't even have the ability to spot small inscriptions of inscriptions under the table. But if the stolen diamonds have reports noting this on them, yes they know they have to either recut these stones or sell them to people that have that capability.\n\nFor consumer thefts, where one or just a few pieces are stolen, recovery is a lot easier, particularly if the gem was gemprinted previously and there isn't a telltale inscription of evidence of it on a grading report.\n\nI really don't understand why the industry is so negligent about gemprinting their inventories. Gemprint as well as brilliance scope / Gemex has ways of identifying diamonds previously imaged.\n\nBut if theives knew all diamonds were previously imaged for identification and matching purposes, then just about every stolen diamond would be recut except the ones stolen by those would not be knowledgeable as to how to ""cover up"" the matching.\n\nThere is also the factor of the law enforcement agency's level of work and attention in recovering such items. Unfortunately, not every police department has the same level of ""due diligence"" in recovering these items. In areas where there are Gemprint centers, we all cooperate and assist police departments and state attorney with diligent assistance by imaging at no charge,any stones brought in by re-imaging any stone they find or are suspicious of.\n\nGemprint will also provide expert witness testimony at trials where there is a recovery, at no charge as well. They will fly in anywhere to assist in helping to "

The 5% is an annual interest rate. Your yield depends a bit on how often the interest is compounded. If it is compounded monthly, then each month you will earn 5/12%  or about .42% interest on the combined principal and accrued balance. Your balance at the end of the six months will be 1000*(1.42)^6 = $1025.26. You have earned a whopping $25.26!

As you probably know, it was mainly used only in high level electronics, especially in the aeronautics industry, until the widespread introduction of the catalytic converter where it is used as the catalyst to reduce smog components in automobile exhaust. This gives it quite an edge over other metals, a widespread application which actually uses up the material. However, its price in relation to gold has far outstripped its relative usage, and I think a lot of speculation is involved considering other possible applications such as fuel cells. I would expect increased demand through automotive applications for at least the next twelve years, by which time we may see some shift to new technology, but still at least level demand.

when you say 10000 a time, do you mean actual gains?  what i mean is to calculate your gain, you subtract your basis(what you purchased it for) from your sales price (what you sold it for).  If that is amounting to 10000 a time, then yes - you have to pay capital gains on that.  \n\nhow do you reduce?  well, if you have other investments that are not doing so well, and you think they wont ever do well, sell them at a loss.  this will reduce your capital gains.  this includes any capital assets you have - real estate, investments, etc, etc.  other than that, there really is no way you can avoid taxes because you already sold them for a gain.  in the future, what i would recommend is at least holding the investments for over a year to ensure long term capital gains rates.
Rather than taking out a $25,000 loan, try setting up a repayment plan.  By incurring further debt, you are laying the foundation for another bankruptcy.  Contact each of your debtors, tell them your situation and then tell them how much you can pay them each month.  Most companies are willing to work with you when it comes to repayment.  If there are interest rates involved, ask that the interest rates be reduced while you try to pay the money back.  In the long run, this is a far better solution than incurring more debt.

The joke I have with a co-worker is anything but an English major.  English majors tend to learn the rules without learning the art of the language.  That major tends to attract some of the meanest, pickiest people around.  That said, if you do end up as an English major, just have fun.\n\nYou go to college to learn to think.  Thinking is different than writing.  Writing is a creative process that comes before thought.  So, the first thing I'd do is write.  Then fit in college after that.\n\nStudy what interests you.  If you're going to be a writer, you're going to create your own income from publishing, right?  Grisham studied law with the intent to be a writer.  Others have done the same.  I'm not saying Grisham's the greatest author, but he's developed his interests.  \n\nGood writers tend to be good readers.  They have curious minds and have developed a sense of rythm in their writing.  Music, literature, liberal arts all come to mind as good seed beds for your mind.  \n\nYou might enjoy grabbing a Great Books list from somewhere (like Columbia) and reading through that.  It'll get you grounded in many classical things to write about.  \n\nAs far as publishing, that's another story.  You'd want a business background for that.  Publishing is just a business with a lot of self confidence.  They've created high beariers to entry to increase their salaries and their sales.  \n\nGood luck with all that.  Enjoy what you do, whatever that is.

It sounds like an episode of Seinfeld!\n\nI hope you get the job.  Your chances look good!  But, if they are interviewing other people then I guess it's still undecided.  I would give it 2-3 days and give them a call to see if they have made a final decision.  Let them know you were impressed with the benefits, etc. and tell them you're really excited about working there.  (Maybe in more professional terms, of course.)

"I once put in my two week notice at my job and the day after I put in my notice they asked me to leave.  They did not fire me.  I asked if I was being fired.  On applications I put that I quit and the reason that I left.  Mostly put ""Looking for a wider range of experience,"" or something like that.  I always tell them that they can call my previous job.  My job can't say anything bad about me or else it is slander.  They can say that you did work there and that they would or would not hire you back.  All other employers will give you a chance to explain why you left.  Just don't speak badly of your previous employer.  If you were fired they will say that they won't hire you back.  If you quit they can say that you are rehirable.  Since they did not say that you were fired you can say that you resigned."

NNNOOOOOOO!!!!!! dont do it!!! I thought that is was a good idea to sign up because you go at your own pace.  so I researched it a little bit and their website looked legit and they said they were accredited.  So I sent them a check for 5 dollars and they said they would get me started and I would make payments to them every month. After I gave them my check, they asked if they could record my voice saying that I want to join the school.  So I did.  Well, they send me my first semester's materials, and they are like middle school literature.  And they even have books that look like they were photocopied.  So in reading the material, it says that if you don't send them your first exams in a certain amount of time, they will drop you from the school, so I didn't send anything to them for a few months because during this time, I found that they are accredited but the president of their board that does the accredidation, is the president of the school.  They accredited themselves.  Also, there is a difference between regionally accredited and nationally accredited.  I found out that after I had already given them the 5 dollars, that most colleges would not let me transfer credits from ashworth.  Most of the colleges had never even heard of ashworth.  Now Ashworth college is trying to come after me for 9 thousand dollars for the whole semester!! When speaking to others, I was told that this one person did an aerial view of the address and all that was there was a warehouse.  There was no school like there was in the pictures on their website.  The same person who did this, called the college and said he was in the area and he wanted to come by and meet some of the staff and they told him he couldnt There are quite a few people including myself who are interested in opening a class action law suit against the school for fraud and deception.  Please, Please, Please, dont do it!!!
I find Indeed.com to be a great starting point for Job Searches.  \n\nYou get results from most of the major job search engines like Monster, Career Builder &  Craig's List in one easy to use location.  They also tell you which engines the jobs originally came from so you can visit them for a more filtered view of jobs.  I have included a link to a Indeed page with Birmingham jobs.\n\nAlso I have included a link to a great free tool for organizing your Job Search. Job Search Log tracks your jobs, ads, and allows you to create and send customized letters for jobs you enter into their system.

When I was 15, I worked as a chambermaid at a motel near my house.  You make an hourly rate plus tips, and you can control the length of your workday to some extent.  For example, if it was a hot, sunny day and we wanted to go to the beach, we busted our azzes and cleaned really quickly to get out of there, and if it was rainy or something, we took our time and stretched out our hours, working longer and making another hour or two's wage.
As Loan Administration Manager at a lending institution some years back, we would consider (and usually approve) deletion of mortgage insurance IF \na) the customer had a good payment history, \nb)  if he/she paid for a new appraisal -- from the appraiser of OUR choice AND\nc) the loan-to-value ratio (based on the new appraisal) was less than 80%.\nHowever, that was  number of years ago and times may have changed since then.  \nI would recommend that you contact your lender and make such a proposal.  The worst thing that can happen is that they will deny your request.
"It's best not to pay an initial fee just to take surveys... there's a website called the ""Survey Club"" that lists all the best free places to take surveys (it's worth a look).\n\nhttp://www.surveyclub.com/special/\n\nPersonally, I take most of my surveys with Global Test Market http://www.globaltestmarket.com/.

There are a wide range of programs available for down payment assistance.  Your loan consultant should be able to give you an overview of all of them.  Ask about special state bond programs, and any federal assistance programs.  I think Ameridream and Dreamhouse are both national but I am certain that will be some that are local for you.\n\nAlso ask you loan consultant about 103% and First Horizon's 107% loans.  The rates are slightly higher but they will also cover some or all of your closing costs.

Well, it takes a bit of creativity, but it can be done. First, before you do this,make sure you have a good reason to do so. If it's just to get cash to blow somewhere, then walk away. However there have been times that I have known I needed the cash for an emergency but been unable to get the cash and credit cards do no good.\n\nIf you are still determined, you might want to set up a PayPal account. Do not use the card information you want to get cash from on your account with Paypal. It would even be better if you had an alternative address on your PayPal account, such as work.\n\nOnce you have your account open, you can send yourself an email requesting payment for a service, by which you can then pay by credit card, minus the small fee. Once you have paid yourself, PayPal allows to you transfer funds into a checking account (or even by a debit card from ATM that they will send you.)\n\nLike I said, takes some creativity, but can be done. Just be sure you NEED to do it.
Normally, the labor force consists of everyone of working age (typically above a certain age (around 14 to 16) and below retirement (around 65) who are participating workers, that is people actively employed or seeking employment.\n\ntherefore It could be a survey for detemining the working age of the present labour force.

The problem with Ebay is that you pay a fee.  Craigslist is the best because you don't have to worry about long distance shipping (a lot of drums I see on Ebay are shipped internationally and the postage is more than the drum is bidding for) and  you don't owe a fee or a commission if you sell.  And it has a subsite for most large US cities and even has a category for musical instruments.
Always ask if the lender reports to a credit agency.  Also, make sure to ask exactly *what* kind of information they report.  There are a lot of lenders out there that will only report information to a credit agency that is negative.  So, for example, if you were late on a payment they would report that information but if you had paid the loan on time they would simply not report anything.
Making a major change is a frightening thing.  You just need to sit down and decide what the pros and cons are of staying or going.  Don't let the people you work with be the only deciding factor.  No one can make this decision but you.  Good luck on your uncertain future.

A good place to start would be the Shanghai area since you are going there. There are loads of factories around the area: Wenzhou, Zhejiang, Suzhou (there is a huge furniture place there - more than 10 huge malls on one street and you can take more than a couple of days just to view it) etc. \n\nAs for container pricing, it really depends on how much you need....there is a bulk discount if you do it in bulk. All the factories will know how to do it when you talk to them. Now...here is one important tip...everything a chinese manufacturer says is up for negotiations...EVERYTHING. Make sure you get all your tax numbers and export documents sorted out - especially for the UK side. \n\nThe Import/Export business is rather physically demanding here as you need someone around in China to make sure that everything goes smoothly.

Homes in Arizona (Tucson and Phoenix specifically) are sitting on the market longer these days.  Many forclosures will be coming on the market as people's adjustable rate mortgages keep rising and they can't make their monthly payments. I would say wait a year to get a good deal, but the drawback to that is that rates will be higher then. You'll have to do the math to see which is a better decision.

"In your example, the quoted ""3%"" refers to interest earned for an entire year.  You cannot expect to earn 3% for only one month.  Each month may be as short as 28 days, or as long as 31 days, so the amount of interest is different each month.  If you calculate the interest each month for a year and add the 12 amounts, you will find the total really is 3% for the entire year (except for possibly a few cents difference because of rounding - our monetary system does not recognize fractions of a cent).\n\n""3%"" REALLY IS 3% in business, but your understanding of simple mathematics needs a little more work."

Not everyone is your target market. Demographics allow you to determine your market and the number of your target market in order to verify whether the business can be profitable.\n\nOn the Web for example, a website needs to determine the demographics of their visitors -- their age, country, occupation and customer segmentation. These information can help them tailor their content to their audience. A website that attracts baby boomers, for example, would offer a different set of content from those that attract high schoolers.\n\nIf you are planning to open a restaurant and you are thinking of a high end fine dining gourmet restaurant. But the demographics of the area where you are planning to open the store shows that the residents in the area are low to middle class income families. Then it doesn't make much sense to open a high end restaurant -- unless you can find a way to bring the high income residents (your target market) to go to a low income place and dine.\n\nA catalog business offering men's products may go after professionals earning $100,000 a year, about 30-52 in age, who owns a house and drives a sports car. That's demographics at work.\n\nDemographics is an important tool in market segmentation. They are a way for you to find your perfect prospects!

"The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. \n\nLegitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that. They can give you anywhere from 1-5 at most surveys in a month. \n\nOther companies simply ask you to answer as many research as possible, and you don't earn anything just the chance to win at a raffle (which I find lame).\n\nThe article ""Earning Money from Surveys"" provide a short list of legitimate market research firms and contains explanations of what to look for when joining surveys (and weeding out the fraudulent ones)\nhttp://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol121/onlinesurvey.htm \n\nPinecone Research http://www.pineconeresearch.com\nGreenField Online http://www.greenfieldonline.com \nHarris Poll Online http://www.harrispollonline.com  \nBuzzBack http://www.buzzback.com  \nSurveySite http://www.surveysite.com \nSurveySavvy http://www.surveysavvy.com\nSurvey Spot http://www.surveyspot.com/\nhttp://www.internetpaidsurveys.com/"
"You're running into a ton of issues here...\n\nFirst of all, the attorney is going to have to be able to docuement ALL of the fees incured for providing you services. He is in no way obliged to any fees for providing the ""loan"" for you unless he is also a licensed loan broker. The fees for securing the loan are not to exceed 5.99% of the total loan amount. These fees are stated as Non-recurring closing costs and are all the fees listed on the HUD-1 closing statement minus the title insurance fee and any state incurred fees. Basically the top 8 lines on the HUD-1 plus the escrow fee.\n\nIt is VERY common for loans to be sold. In this case the attorney realizes he is not a lending institution and with good intelligence has reverted the loan (Probobly sold it at a premium, illegally since he's probobly not a licensed mortgage broker) and made yet another profit.\n\nThere is also an issue in him appointing himself as the trustee to the note. As stated in RESPA a trustee to a secured note is to be a ""Mutual third party with no interest in the loan transaction"". \n\nI imagine the entity that bought the loans is a ""loan to own"" type entity and hoping that you will defualt on your mortgage. So, if I was you I would be very wary of missing any payements whatsoever to your mortgage. If you have to make a choice between paying your mortgage or car notes, pay the mortgage.\n\nA real-estate attorney will gladly look over the transaction and ensure that everything was done not only legally but ethically as well without charging you an upfront fee. If he finds there is misconduct, he will take on the case without any upfront fees if he is worth his weight.\n\nGood luck, and next time you need some cash shoot me an Email. I've been doing private money loans for a few years now both ethically and legally."

Good.  It leads to the creation of money and economic growth.  Flexibility and the ability to invest.
Sounds like you need to get a job.
Ask them !
Try UPS or another delivery company.  If you're willing to work weird hours you can make $12/hr or more.\n\nOr you could try to get hired as a mailer at a newspaper.  Some big papers pay pretty good.  Depends where you live.\n\nSome restaurants hire assistant managers without a degree or experience (I was offered this before I had my degree).  Then you can move up the ladder from there.\n\nOr there's always construction.
You will only be able to borrow up to 125% of the value of your home.  Typically that is a bad idea incase you have to move and end up having to pay money to sell your own house.  Good luck
It seems the families they pick have something extraordinary that happens to them...it's not like they always lived that way (most)\n\nAlso, seems like from time to time the family is given a little cash too.
"Sorry to say but this is an increasingly common scam.  Please do yourself a favor and do a web search on ""australian international lottery""\n\nHere's what the Department of Consumer and Employment Protection of the Government of Western Australia has to say about the ""Australian International Lottery""  \n\nfrom: http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/ConsumerProtection/ScamNet/Scams/Australian_Internati.html\n\nAustralian International Lottery\nAdvance fee fraud\n\nWouldn’t it be nice to be told you have won $200,000? Not if the email is from the Australian International Lottery Program.\n\nThe only money you’ll see is the money you waste sending it to these scammers.\n\nWestern Australia’s government lottery commission, Lotterywest, is receiving numerous emails from overseas consumers asking whether Australian International Lottery Program is legitimate. It’s not.\n\nLotterywest have posted a warning on its website http://www.lotterywest.wa.go.au about these types of lotteries.\n\nAustralian International Lottery claims your email was selected from a computer balloting system drawn from 900,000 email addresses from around the world.\n\nIt claims the lottery is promoted and sponsored by a conglomerate of some multi-national companies as part of their social responsibility to the citizens in the communities where they have an operational base.\n\nYour email details falls within the European representative office in Amsterdam, Holland, and your money will be released from the regional branch in Nigeria.\n\nConsumers take note: Nigeria is the home of the advance fee fraud.\n\nBut be warned that the scammers often change slight details in these emails including the amounts, their office locations and where to send money.\n\nIf you respond to this email, you will be asked to send $500 through Western Union to release your prize. The $500 is supposedly needed to swear an affidavit on your behalf at the Federal High Court of Justice so the money can be transferred out of the country.\n\nThe scammers (under the guise of a bank) request your bank account details, address, birth date, driver’s licence or passport, and your signature. Ask yourself: do you really want these people to have your details?"
NO! US FEDERAL labor laws!
"I am assuming by ""credit card imprint machine"" you are referring to a manual imprinter and not a electronic credit card terminal - let me know if I am wrong. This makes a big difference in regards to the setup costs, since you do not have to purchase an expensive terminal. It does, however, also add a manual step in processing that will need to be properly managed. Also, all of your transactions will be considered ""key entered"" and you will be charged a higher rate. To be clear - if you do not process a card electronically, you will not receive the low rates that merchant processors quote in their marketing materials.\n\nYour best bet will be to start a dial-pay account. With this type of account, you will actually be imprinting the card and then calling in for approval for every card presented. This is actually a very quick process, but if you are doing a large amount of transactions, you should consider investing in a terminal.\n\nYour bank may seem like a very easy choice for processing. Unless it is a very large bank, though, they do not actually perform merchant processing services. It is more likely that they have been solicited by a merchant processor that won the bid for your banks customer leads and a certain portion of your fees will now go to your bank. The service and support, though, will be handled by the processor and your bank will not be involved.\n\nBe sure to consider the following:\n1.) As you will not be swiping cards for approval be very aware of the retail ""card not present"" and ""key entered"" rates that your processor assesses. \n\n2.) Be sure to know all of the different card rates. You will most likely receive debit cards, personal MC and Visa, Visa Rewards, MC World, and MC & Visa Corporate cards. Many processors sneak in a ""nonqualified"" rate for the Rewards, World and Corporate cards that can be upwards of 3%.\n\n3.) Be sure to work with a service oriented processor. Your method of processing will not be typical, so don't get stuck with a company that does not have a reputation for decent account management.\n\nYour key entered rates should start in the low 2.0% range and vary depending on card type.\n\nIf you would like more information about merchant processing, feel free to contact me at jbordeaux@windriverfinancial.c... or at (920)993-9433. Wind River is a merchant processor that specializes in offering well supported, competitively priced, custom processing services."

Money is important because it's the link between buyer and seller in most economies.  It creates a mutually beneficial exchange between buyer and seller. Buyer gets goods, seller gets cash to by more goods...\n\nAnyhow...you can work and make money, inherit it, or win the lotto....or maybe get a loan.

"My cousins are coming from overseas and imigrating to the U.S. So I have a general idea. It's very difficult for them right now to get credit cards due to their lack of any credit history. The only ones available are either bank cards that they open an account with, or other credit card companies that will give them a small credit line and require annual fees.\n\nTo quickly build credit, I would recommend opening a bank account of course, start paying some sort of bills (utlities) quickly to get a record of on-time payments. You will quickly establish a history and your credit situation will improve. I hope that helps!\n\nGood luck!\n\n**EDIT:\n\nI just noticed you said you were moving to the U.S. to join your husband. If he already has credit, then you might want to also consider opening joint credit cards with his name on the card. This will also help you establish credit without having to start from the ground up. You'll get a ""boost"" from his credit."

"Blue Barrel\n\nIn reference to petroleum, specifically oil and natural gas liquids, bbl is an abbreviation for 1 barrel, equal to exactly 42 U.S. gallons, or approximately 159 liters. The abbreviations 1 Mbbl and 1 MMbbl are generally accepted to mean one thousand and one million barrels respectively. (In non-industry documentation Mbbl can sometimes stand for one million barrels.) While North American markets typically measure oil in barrels, elsewhere oil is more commonly measured in cubic meters and less commonly in metric tonnes. Natural gas is measured differently.\n\nIn the early 1860's, when oil production began, there was no standard container for oil, so oil and petroleum products were stored and transported in barrels of all different shapes and sizes (beer barrels, fish barrels, molasses barrels, turpentine barrels, etc.). By the early 1870's, the 42-gallon barrel had been adopted as the standard for oil trade. This was 2 gallons per barrel more than the 40-gallon standard used by many other industries at the time. The extra 2 gallons was to allow for evaporation and leaking during transport (most barrels were made of wood). Standard Oil began manufacturing 42 gallon barrels that were blue to be used for transporting petroleum. The use of a blue barrel, abbreviated ""bbl"", guaranteed a buyer that this was a 42-gallon barrel."
Check with the I.R.S. and the Small Business Administration for some free advice.\nYou can deduct business expenses like advertising and travel.  Check out Allocation of Income and Expenses, schedule P form 5735 at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf.  This is the basic form you are looking for.\n\nYou can deduct any equipment that is used exclusively for the business, like a file cabinet, which can be depreciated, usually over seven years, where you recover the expense of the equipment over time.  You can also deduct the expenses for your car when used to travel for the business.  You must keep a mileage log to qualify.  If you use a computer and deduct it then that computer must be devoted entirely to the business, any personal programs on it will cancel this deduction\n\nYou can deduct part of your home expenses for the area of the home that you use exclusively for your business, but this is a red flag for the IRS, and can force an audit.  If you want this deduction then make sure that part of the house is used only for business.  I knew an Amway dealer that had a system of shelves in the garage for storing his stock.  That would be a legal deduction, and you will may need some space to store stock and samples.\n\nYou will need to use the 1040 tax form and remember to pay the self-employment tax (Check out lines 13, 24, 27,28, 29).  You will need to fill out Schedule SE Self-Employment Tax (instructions are found at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/i1040sse.pdf the form itself is found at:  http://www.unclefed.com/IRS-Forms/2005/f5735sp.pdf)  Use Form 8829 Expenses for Business Use of Your Home.\n\nThese forms are pretty daunting so you might want to find Tax Preparation software, make sure it can handle a small business.  Or you might want to go to a Tax Perparer like H&R block.  I recommend the later because they will know what deductions are legal and accepted by the I.R.S.
A coverdell 529 plan is a state sponsered education savings program that offers some tax benefits. Money that you put into it are dedicated to the education of one of your kids. It took the place of the education ira as the primary way that people saved money for college expenses around 4 years ago. Every state in the US offers a different plan and some of those plans are better than others in terms of investment selections and plan fees. There is a good website that allows you to input your situation and it will recommend which state plan would work best for you. (You are not locked into the plan for the state in which you live) That website is www.savingforcollege.com. For a lot of people the 529 plan is the ideal way to save for college. You can start one of these plans directly thru the state that you choose or you can go thru a broker. If you go thru a broker you will likely pay fees that you wouldn't pay thru the direct route.

Check your agreement, or any billing statement.  It spells that out exactly.\n\nThe minimum payment is typically 2.5% to 5% of the ending balance, usually with a minumum of $10.00 or so.  There has been pressure from lawmakers to raise the minimum payments lately to help get people out of debt more quickly.\n\nAnything over the credit limit is also due immediately, as are any late fees or over-limit fees.\n\nSo, if your credit card has a 4% minimum payment and you were right at the $1,000 limit, your payment would be $40.00.  If you went over your limit by $100.00 and they charged you a $30.00 over-limit fee, your minumum payment would be:\n\n$44.00 (4% of $1,100.00) plus\n$30.00 (over-limit fee) plus\n$100.00 (amount you are over the limit)\n\n$174.00 (total minimum payment due)
The fact that you are on here asking this tells me that you need to cut that card up... there is nothing in life that is THAT important that you should have to charge it.

Hey I can relate.  I worked for a whacko of a boss for 8 long years and she made me feel very nervous because she took great pleasure in bringing people down one at a time... but then she would be nice to them the next week and then wham!!! She would take you out at your knees...well, in 8 years she never changed... so that is probably the way your boss will be until you leave or your boss does.  \nStrategies- no eye contact unless you have to speak to her.\nDO NOT go out of your way to be extra friendly as this is percieved as a weakness in their eyes.  ( You think you are safer when you are friendly but you are not)  Do your job well so you don't give her the opportunity to ream you out.  I tried to kill my boss with kindness and things got worse... I stopped and she started to be nicer to me.  Go figure?  \nShe was nasty with many of the staff at my work and we grouped together and supported each other making us stronger as a group.  HR was called many times but nothing ever became of it.  Keep your chin up and don't be afraid of her behavior.  I know it is easier said then done... but if you stop caring what she is bitchy about then you will find your sanity will return slowly.\nTime to tune her problems out and do your job to the best of your abilities. If not there are many other jobs out there...you will have to go hunting.
Contact the business, first by phone then by registered mail. If no activity is seen then the only route is hire an attorney and charge them the legal fees.

Say you come in to a bank and want to open a checking account.  The customer service person does this for you, but he or she will also talk about opening a savings account, getting online access for your account, getting a credit card, and other things.  They are referring other products to you.  If you get the product, they have made a successful referral.  \nThis process is called cross selling, which just means that they try to get you to buy other things while selling you what you came in for.

Yes.  You can get management experience working in ANY field.\n\nThink about it - whatever job you have, you have a manager, right?  How do you think that person got the job?  By first having your job and being promoted.\n\nSo, get a regular old job, preferably at a business that's growing fast, and work hard at it.  Don't goof off like the other employees.  Act responsible and help the more junior/newer employees when they don't know how to do something.  This will mark you apart from your co-workers as someone who can handle the responsibilities of management, and you'll probably soon be trained into an assistant manager position, and from there, you'll be gaining management experience.
More purchasing power to the people., Credit cards indirectly infuse more funds into the market., \nfor example in a country where a total of $ 120,000 millions are spent in cash, that is $10,000 MN per month, and if credit cards are used, for one month's purchases, then one half months' purchases would be made additional for that period of 12 (a total puchases of 13.5 months could be effected in 12 months, assuming 45 day credit period) , to that extent it will have a positive effect on the GDP.\nthat the following are the possible effects.,\n1. higher inflation\n2. Increase in the market size\n2. cheaper credit (provided if you repay in full in time)\n3. if Large amount of credit cards dues are not recovered they could have a bad effect on the economy as a whole,

New Jersey is very strict with their real estate laws.  Commissions can only be collected by a licensed real estate agent.  Technically an attorney who is a licensed real estate agent can accept a commission.  If they are acting as a lawyer AND real estate agent on the same deal it might create a conflict of interests, by not representing their client's needs to the fullest.  This might be a problem with the New Jersey Real Estate Commission.

"Im a newly certified real estate salesperson in N.Y. One thing that I suggest you refresh on is Respa, fannie mae, sally mae, and freddie mac, Remember they symbolize the secondary market... Remember what is involved with dual agency. Breathe before the test .... Get this my test was given in the state capitol of new york.. i live about 2 hours away and I thought i had left early enough. Guess not anyway I got there about 10 min late then got lost going to the testing site. I forgot some of my paperwork in the car which they would not let me get. I then proceeded to fill out their paperwork. It was about 11:30 by the time i started the exam and it was timed. I didn't think I passed because I know I didn't actually finish but was unsure of the question number I got too.... I PASSED!! So don't do all of that and breathe before the test you'll be fine YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW!!.. Don't cram the night before you take the exam... It will stress you out and the information will not leak in... I am confident that you will pass all of your own expectations and pass with flying colors...\nAlso I suggest you attend a couple of your local open houses. Open houses are the best place to see a realtor at work.. do you need to secure a broker before the exam is taken? If so speak with your sponsoring broker He obviously is rooting for you to succeed I mean the more money you bring in the better for the broker.  Remember that it is just a test and you can take it again... know the differences of deeds, warranty, referee, Bargain and sale deed with covenant, bargain and sale deed without covenant, executors deed, quitclaim deed. Know what a lein is and how a person can get one. Supply, and demand, etc.. good luck you'll do fine as my sponsoring broker says ""its not rocket science, just do it"" Good luck with your future career. And if you need a study partner I can help, I could always use a refresher before I get into the REAL WORLD of real estate!!"

They're not true.\n\nThe government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.\n\nFor one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.\n\nThere is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.\n\nYou can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two FREE sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

"""Call Loans and the Interbank Call Loan Market\n\nCall money are amounts traded in the interbank call loan market that correspond to the excess or deficiency of each bank in terms of reserves. These can be overnight placements.\n\nIBCL transactions among banks are done primarily to correct reserve requirements. The reserve position of each bank or quasi-bank is calculated daily on the basis of the amount of the institution’s reserves at the close of business for the day and the amount of its liability accounts against which reserves are required to be maintained. The reserve positions of banks are normally known after the check clearing results have been transmitted. As the check clearing results are known only by late afternoon, interbank call loans are currently done from 4:45 PM to 5:30 PM\n\nThe interbank market can either be securitized (collateralized) or unsecuritized (clean) lendings/borrowings, as well as repurchase agreements. Repurchase Agreements are (RPs) are generally short-term sale of government securities with an agreement to repurchase on the agreed maturity date. Repurchase agreements are extensively used as a means of short-term financing by government securities dealers and by banks.""\n\nSo, Interbank Call Loans Receivables would be money that's coming in from the interbank call loan market."

Most managers have a set model that they use and is generated by computer.

Yes you can. The low 3.99% APR is usually for a short term. You can borrow $25,000, say for 6 months, then put that money in a 6 month CD (they pay a higher interest rate) typically paying 5.80%. You pocket the difference, 1.81% of $25,000. You make $450 in 6 months.

That depends on what rate you're paying on your student loan.   If you're loan payment is higher than the 5-5.5% you can get from the bank or CD, then you're losing money on the spread.  In other words, the loan is costing you money.   On the other hand, if you had your money invested in something that gave you an average annual return that exceeded the loan rate, then I would advocate keeping the loan because you're making money on the spread.\n\nThe other issue is whether your student loan is fixed or adjustable.   Student loan rates will be going up about 1.5% in the next few months.   If that affects you then it may be even more motivation to go ahead and pay it off.   Ultimately, you just have to decide if you can invest the money for more than the loan payment with a reasonable low risk (based on what you're saying your risk factors are) because if not, then paying on the loan while you make less from the bank doesn't make sense.
It´s a good idea to invest but you need a plan. \n\nInstead of investing assets in a lump sum, you can work your way into an investment position by slowly buying small amounts each month. This spreads the cost basis out over several years, providing insulation against up and down periods of the stock market. \n\nThis method is called Dollar Cost Averaging.\n\nIn order to begin a dollar cost averaging plan, you must do three things:\n1. Decide exactly how much money you can invest each month. Make certain that you are financially capable of keeping the amount consistent; otherwise the plan will not be as effective.\n 2. Select an investment (index funds are particularly appropriate) that you want to hold for the long term, preferably five to ten years or longer.\n 3. At regular intervals (monthly or quarterly works best), invest that money into the funds you’ve chosen. If your broker offers it, set up an automatic withdrawal plan so the process becomes automated. \n\nThis idea works even better in a tax deferred savings plan like a 401K in the USA.\n\nThe source refers to Dollar Cost averaging, but the whole site is interesting.
"The previous answers are good.  \n\nYour credit does take a dip when you cancel your credit card.  It removes part of your ""credit history"" and increases your debt/credit ratio.  These two items make up a large part of your credit score.\n\nI would suggest contacting BOA.  You said you got a better offer from another company?  Ask BOA to match it, or else you will not do business with them.  If they don't remove the annual fee then definately cancel the card and take the momentary hit to your credit report.  I think annual fees are a scam anyway."
Letters of Credit, a commercial letter of credit issued by a bank on behalf of the importer.  In the document, the bank agrees to honor a draft drawn on the importer, provided the bill of lading and other details are in order.  In essence, the bank substitutes its credit for that of the importer. Obviously, the local bank will not issue a letter of credit unless it feels the importer is creditworthy and will pay the draft.\n\nThe letter of credit arrangement almost eliminates the exporter's risk in selling goods to an unknown importer in another country.

"you gotta start somewhere. you can get professional jobs right out of college but they'll be, depending on what you're looking for, manager trainee or asst. something. look at it this way, you haven't any professional expereince but are looking for work at a place that is ""professional."" stepping stones you know. gotta learn to crawl before you can walk. find something along the lines of work you're looking for. stick it out for awhile, then start looking for the real job you want to get. if you want to work at a bank, start off as a teller or a sales associate. you'll learn everything you need to know and in a 8-10 months you'll know enough to shop yourself around and look for something more professional. education nowadays is expected but really amounts to nothing. experience is what employers look for. can you do the job, have you ever done it before, have you been successful in the past. they need documented track of success or very good references that prove to them you are capable of handling the job and responsibilites. no one gives professional experience, you gain it. like i said, you have to start somwehere. sounds to me like your looking for the quick fix to your career search and it's very unlikely you'll ever find it. might get lucky but most likely you'll just keep looking and find nothing."
I think you just tell the company who holds your IRA that you are wanting to buy a home and you would like to use your money in your IRA to put a nice down payment on one & they should be able to fill out a 1099 form (i think that is what they call that form-it is either 1099 or 1098) showing that that money is not taxable income.

I recommend the east bay near the bart stations. I used to live in El Cerrito and the neighborhood is very nice. The only thing is, that was over 5 years ago, I am sure prices are up, but you should be able to find something reasonable around there. Good luck!

You have to go to a bank and cash it.  If you don't have an account, mabye your parents do and they can cash it for you if you sign it over to them.  Hope this helps you!  Congrats on Graduation and the best of luck to you.
ı am an accounting and finace major student. This is my last semester. I will continue to a masters degree in accounting and finace. My advice is continue i a different school from yours and country. Finace is wide so there is a way to go. ıt is not so important for a marketing major to make masters degree but i think its important for finance. You can continue in England. They have one year masters programs and they are very good. I will go to LSE next year. Good luck...

"""Bad"" is relative and subjective; different for every person; a perception.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act is the tail that wags the dog, and is unconstitutional. The Federal Reserve is a private institution, run by a few very powerful men, that decide the fate of our economy.\n\nIs that bad? I would say so. Not what our forefathers intended. You're complaining about nickels and dimes. The whole thing is a scam."
You don't have a lot of options. Unless you can come up with your arrears in a hurry, your best bet would be to contact one of the many companies that offers rapid purchase of your home, and sell it to them. If you owe less than the home is worth, you get some money to start over, and no matter what you owe, you avoid foreclosure which will haunt your credit rating for years. You can also let the lender know you have a sale pending which should halt the foreclosure for at least a week or two, giving you time before the sale to find somewhere else to live.
"Most employers and employees (over 16 years of age) in Ireland pay social insurance contributions into Ireland's national Social Insurance Fund. In general, the payment of social insurance is compulsory. \n\nIreland's Social Insurance Fund is made up of a current account and an investment account managed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance, respectively. The current account consists of monies collected from people in employment. This money is then paid back to fund social insurance benefits and entitlements. The investment account is a savings account that is managed by the Minister for Finance. The Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for ensuring that the accounts are kept in order and reports are made to the Houses of the Oireachtas. \n\nIf you are in employment, the amount of social insurance you pay depends on your earnings and the type of work you do. Your social insurance contributions in Ireland are referred to as PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance). Sometimes, you will hear people describe their PRSI record as ""stamps"". This term dated from before 1979 when employers would literally stamp a card each week of employment. That card was then brought to a local social welfare office in order to claim social welfare payments. \n\nSince 1979, your employer keeps a record of the insurance contributions you make. These monies are now collected by the Revenue Commissioners who in turn make annual returns of these records to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. All records of your insurance contributions are kept by the PRSI Records section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. \n\nSocial insurance rates\nFor people in employment in Ireland, social insurance contributions are divided into different categories, known as classes or rates of contribution. The type of class and rate that you pay is determined by the nature of your work. For example, a person employed in a supermarket earning less then 38 euro per week will be insured under Class J. If that person earned over 38 euro, they would probably be insured under Class A. In fact, most employees in Ireland pay Class A PRSI. This class of contribution may entitle you to the full range of insurance-based benefits that are available from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. \n\nThe other classes of social insurance are classes C, D, B, E, H, J, S, K, M, and P. If you are insured under one of these classes, you are paying insurance at a lower rate than Class A contributors, which means that you are not entitled to the full range of social insurance benefits. This is because you are paying less towards social insurance than a Class A contributor. \n\nExample: Joe earns less than 38 euro per week. He is insured under Class J, which only entitles him to Occupational Injuries Benefit. \n\nDetails of the different groups and occupations that these classes apply to and the benefits covered are contained in the Department of Social and Family Affairs Booklet SW14. (Also available from your local social welfare office). \n\nIf there is a problem in deciding what class of social insurance you should pay, the Scope Section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs may decide the issue after examining your employment situation. \n\nHow is social insurance (PRSI) paid?\nIf you are an employee, your social insurance contributions are deducted by your employer and collected by the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners then pay the money into the Social Insurance Fund. A record of the contributions you have paid is then sent to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Your employer will also pay social insurance on your behalf. \n\nAs well as paying into the Social Insurance Fund, you will also be expected to pay what is called the Health Contribution, which is charged at 2% on all income. The Health Contribution is not paid into the Social Insurance Fund. This money is collecte"

"You may want to read the article “6 Hottest Businesses on the Web  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/052006/web.htm which lists six areas of the new Web that present new opportunities to small online businesses:\n\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\n\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\n\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \n\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\n\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or EuropeforVisitors.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\n\na. Advertising - From the article ""How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site"" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\n\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \n\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \n\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \n\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\n\n3. Sell advertising for your site directly. This is admittedly a more difficult route for a small business site wanting to earn advertising revenues. But hey, as they say: ""no pain, no gain!"" \n\nb. Affiliate Programs - you sell other people's products that your audience may be interested in; and you get a certain commission after the desired action was done (whether a sale, a lead, subscription to email newsletter, or however this is defined)\n\nc. Paid online content. Hoovers.com or WebmasterWorld.com Supporters forum all require paid subscription before accessing the information\n\nd. Content licensing and syndication.

try this strategic trick:\n\n1. go to your bank first where you are familiar with the people. ask them for a loan, get the interest rate and the plan and all details, check for any hidden extras.\n\n2. check online at all the banks offers (including your bank) print the best offers that you may get (i am sure u will get a lower interest rate than your own bank) from reliable banks.\n\n3. now be very cunning: go to the first step with a twist, show them your research, and show them the best deal you have got from the internet.\n\n4. mostly they are ready to negotiate and ask them for a lower rate than the one you have researched. mostly they will discuss (privately with some hidden manager) and  get back to you. \n\n5. if they give a lower rate you have striken a jackpot, if not go to the internet loan offer.\n\nhurrah now you can feel that consumer is a king. and you have nothing to lose.\n\ngood luck.
a 30 yr term policy is not a good choice--you will overpay the premium the first 15 yrs, and underpay the 2nd 15 yrs, to get a level premium.. a better choice would be ART, annually renewable term..this is more a pay-as-you go premium..it increases some every yr, yet you don't overpay in the early yrs to get a level premium..also, you can renew it for as long as you want to keep the policy.. much more flexible, and a better value, premium wise..look for an Independent Insurance Agent in the yellow pages, under life insurance.. that is someone who represents several different companies..he/she will search out the best value for you, based on your circumstances.. any other ??..holler back at me..good luck to you..i am a retired Independent Insurance Broker for life and health insurance, and a retired CPA, CFP, & LUTCF also.....
"There is such a thing as an ""implied easement"" for utilities.  Almost certainly, that's what your state allows.

"There are many businesses who started with so little yet grew to become good income vehicles down the road. There are many businesses that you can start with $25,000. \n\nThe key is to determine what your interests are, what you want to do, what is suitable for your lifestyle and your overall goals, and what can fit with your resources.\n\nDan Ramsey in his book ""101 Best Home Businesses"" has a chapter on how to find YOUR best home business.

Consider your time and effort - if you have little cash, you may have to work harder for the money because you will have no resource to outsource or employ others to do certain tasks for you; or you have no money to buy equipment so you can only do certain things the long way\n\n3. Get your creative juices flowing. With no money, the only thing you have is your imagination. Be creative and find ways to get things done \n\n4. Be prepared to do all the work yourself - from doing your business plan, finding financing, writing emails, shipping and handling, marketing or whatever processes your business requires. \n\n5. Be prepared to invite investors - you may need financing help from someone down the road so be prepared to share some of the pie."

I have owned 2 condos & 2 houses.  I noted that owning and living in each of them posed different benefits and concerns. \nCONDO is the way to go IF\n1 -   You can afford to pay the Mainteance Fees. \n2 - You realize that even after you pay the mortgage on your condo, you will also still have to continue paying the mainteance fees.  \n3 - the BENEFIT is that there is no shoveling of snow, and the association will do all outside repairs. \n  \nA HOUSE is the way to go if:  \n1 - You want more privacy\n2 - You want your own private yard.  I miss that about the houses. \n3 - If you enjoy or are willing to do some repairs around the house.  I learned how to do all sorts of things & loved it. \n4 - There are NO Mainteance Fee payments to an agency, you just pay for your own repair costs.  \nIf you need help with finding the luckiest numbers to help you find the luckiest homes, or finding the best dates to move, etc. visit http://astrowishes.com
Based on my experience, it's probably not that much. I used to work in a bank and would review loan applications from people with little or no credit history. Your best bet is to get a co-signer with a good credit history to back the loan with you being the primary applicant but even with this approach you may still only qualify for up to a few thousand or less depending on your current income and other expenses. Although, even starting with just a few thousand it should be a good starting loan to establish some history for you. Keep in mind though that every lender has their own requirements but the more lenient they are you're probably paying for that with a much higher interest rate.
You can't go wrong with a simple black or gray suit (whether pants or skirt) and a crisp white shirt. Your town may have a clothing bank (usually found in a church outreach ministry or as part of an employment assistance agency) or if you have thrift stores in town such as Salvation Army, etc. you will be able to find inexpensive clothing there that is top notch. Do your best to keep your look simple and professional, and look and smell clean. Your ATTITUDE will be your best piece of wearing apparel!

"There are clubs for ""dominants & submissives"", gay clubs and clubs for ""swingers"" to hook up.  So why not a strip club for men (or women) who enjoy a fuller form?  I have said for years now (usually as a punch-line -- yet half-seriously, too) that if I ever had the financial means, I would open such a club in Las Vegas and call it Phatt Chicks. That was long before the Phatt Pharm clothing line was launched.  (I had the name first!  Dang, I should have copy-righted it or trade-marked it or whatever you do!  I could be rich!)  Oh, well.....\nLet's face it, we live in a sexually diverse culture.  Just because many men would reject such a club I don't doubt that there is a market for your ""product"".  The reason I would select Vegas for Phatt Chicks is that you would have a large cross-section of the adult population in a city that was created tfor the express purpose of providing an outlet for adults to ""let it all hang out"".  Besides that -- it's Vegas, Baby.\nGood luck on your proposed venture.  Feel free to send me my ""cut"" if you use the name I have proposed.  Thanks!"

Let me start by appologizing to you if what follows is insulting.  I am trying to be completely honest and helpful.\n\nAre there any banks which will floorplan your start-up used car lot?  Yes but ...  Many banks do not like to make floorplan loans because they are inherently risky (collateral by its nature is mobile and tends to disappear).  Many banks do not like to lend to start-up businesses because they do not have a history of success.  Many banks do not like to lend money to independent used car lots because they can be shady.  That said, I suspect you might have a hard time finding a floorplan line of credit for a start-up independent used car lot.\n\nI might suggest a loan company as opposed to a bank.  Be prepared to sign the loan personally and possibly mortgage your home as additional collateral.

If they had any estate, the creditor can collect the debt. If not, they have to write it off.
"Let me warn you of something.\n\nIf you were to pay off this bill, and IF the creditor notifies the credit bureau, your account is changed to ""paid"".  However, it will still show that you had late payments, or that the account was in collections.  This is still a negative item on your report, and it will still hurt your score.\n\nDoes it make sense to pay off your bill and still have bad credit?\n\nThe problem is that the only way you can get a negative item removed is for the creditor to tell them to remove it.  There is no other way (except to go through the dispute process and hope the creditor does not respond to the investigation). \n\nWhat I advise people to do is negotiate with the creditor.  Tell them that in exchange for paying off the bill, they must agree IN WRITING to remove all negative information from your credit report.  \n\nSee the link below for more info."

Without the county name, it was hard to find the exact site you're looking for but I did find a few that might point you in the right direction:\n\nhttp://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/welcome.html -- Bureau of Justice Statistics\nhttp://www.disastercenter.com/crime/ -- Link to all states crime statistics\n\nSorry I couldn't find the exact site -- hope these help!
To answer your question, there is no website that provides which credit bureau a creditor pulls from. One way to find out is to get denied and then they must tell you which one(s) they pulled from.  The best bet is to get your credit in order across the board. Not all 3 bureaus carry the same information, but you never know when information may cross over. Would hate to do all the work in the world to get Equifax up and then find out that Experian shared some info or something. Or worse, that the creditor pulled from all 3 anyway.\n\nWork on getting your scores up by having the right balance of revolving credit, installment credit and payments made on time. Negative items within the last 24 months may be affecting your scores, so you may want to address them. If older than 24 months you may not need to worry about them until later, but eventually you will want to get them straight too.\n\nNo long term shortcuts in credit, but with the right direction long terms excellent credit is attainable for anyone!
