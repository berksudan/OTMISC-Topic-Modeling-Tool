This Week in Tech is a great podcast.  It's hosted by Leo Laport (of TechTV fame) and features several guests each week, usually other ex-TechTV people and John Devorak.  It's basically a discussion of tech news stories from the week.  It's been the top podcast for some time now, probably because of the well known, intelligent hosts as well as the professional production quality.\n\nBrowsing the podcasts available on iTunes can be a good way to easily sample some podcasts on topics you're interested in.
"Yes, and some sites provide ""partial"" feeds via RSS, requiring the user to go to the site before being able to read all the data.\n\nThe argument for full feeds more or less runs like this:  You need to entice users to your site.  By providing a full feed you are giving your users what they want, and they will be more inclined to look upon you favorably.  So rather than directly forcing eyeballs to your site, you are working on the reputation of your site for quality data, and hoping the users will pass along your site to others through bloglines or deli.cio.us, and getting new  eyeballs indirectly."

Hi jfitznc,\n\nThe good news is, yes, most of the time; Using the System Restore disk is your surefire bet to getting rid of the virus.\n\nImmediantly after you format/restore your system, I HIGHLY reccomend that you download a virus scanner (http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmVLdYKgcntPhHyt6WuZ9afsy6IX?qid=1005120804379 ) and to a scan right away.  If your updated antivirus software does not detect anything -- you should be in the clear.  Keep your scanner running after this recovery so you don't get a virus again!

Hi.\n\nYour in quite a sticky situation :(\nYou might not be able to find the service that the person you wish to email is using (the bit after @) as if they have a popular address then it would be likely that many people would have that prefix but with other services. You would be best trying to contact the person via another means of communication and asking them for the ending of their address.\n\nHope I Helped.\n\nDavid.
"First, you must upload the video to a web server. In your HTML, use the following tags:\n<embed src=""your_movie_filename.mov""> </embed>\nOr, a more current practice is to use the <object> tags.\n\nAnother easier alternative is to use video sharing web service like www.youtube.com, where you can upload a movie and it will generate the appropriate scripts you can add to your webpage."

"While all AMD processors now support 64 bit processing, the Sempron processors are AMD's ""value"" line, run at somewhat lower clock speeds, and have less L2 cache on chip, making them much less expensive to manufacture while still providing very good performance. (see link 1) The AMD Athlon 64 and 64FX processors (links 2,3) run at higher clock speeds and have more L2 cache, providing excellent performance, but costing much more to make than Sempron.  Athlon 64 X2 is AMD's dual core CPU, providing more stable operation for tasks such as video editing."

Noticed he said CONTENT.  Content is information aside from the website design and layout.\n\nContent on a website is best unique, as opposed to syndicated (taken from someone else).\n\nIf your site is uniquely written, that's good.  If it's well written, that's great.\n\nIf your site is writing about an interesting topic, uniquely written by you, and well-written, that's awesome -- That's the premisis for creating content for a good website.\n\nAlso, content can come in forms of raw data -- Like, if you wanted to make a travel site -- you can list the prices it takes to fly from Chicago to Pittsburg.  Or you can have a currency converter.\n\nAnother thing you can incorporate is a chatroom or message board for users to discuss the content and post their suggestions.

It is better to stick on your normally doing. I know from experience that pretty interesting email is dangerous. I clicked on an interesting email once and got more and more spams since then. Spammers are skillful today, they know how to make their emails not go to bulk folder. No matter how interesting the email you got is, please don't reply. Hope you haven't yet. I understand your curiousity if that email address really exists, but remember, curiousity can cost you a lot.

"Contact your cable provider first as some do not permit the use of privately owned modems, or use proprietary cable modem technologies not available on the market (few but some).  If they will allow it, ask if it needs to be DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0 compliant as different cable services have varying requirements.  \n\nIf they provide a modem, make sure, once you receive the modem and setup your service you have them ""provision"" the modem on their network as it is likely they will have provisioned theirs already for you.  Provisioning assigns the address of your new modem to your cable connection, otherwise the new modem will not be ""allowed"" to communicate on their network.  Also, make sure to return the modem they provide, and have them cancel your rental fees!"
get 3 network cards (NIC). They are around $5. Get a autoswitch (you can get a Dlink DSS-5+ for $15 on the net). And get 3 Cat5e cables to connect with the switch (they are 3-5 $ each). Often computers have a NIC on board, so check first (control panel - system - hardware - device - mangager - network adapters) if you need a NIC on each pc.

"What Does AJAX Stand For?\n\nAJAX means 'Asynchronous Javascript and XML'. Adaptive Path came up with the term in this essay: http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php. However, the word is really a bit of a misnomer: AJAX doesn't really rely on XML at all, but rather on a Javascript function that happens to be named XMLHttpRequest.\n\nAll About XMLHttpRequest.\n\nXMLHttpRequest was originally invented and implemented by a Microsoft team who were working on a webmail application, and it's been around for a while now (since 1999, in fact). The reason it has suddenly come to prominence now is that Google used it in three projects, Gmail, Google Suggest and Google Maps, and in each case managed to create a much better user interface than they would have been able to otherwise.\n\nSo what does XMLHttpRequest do? To put it simply, it lets your Javascript go back to the server, fetch some new content, and write it back out onto the page - all without the user having to change pages. This gives a 'smoother' feel to web applications, as they can do things like submit forms without the whole browser window needing to go blank and reload the page. Take a look at maps.google.com now, and notice how you can drag the map around anywhere you want to go without having to reload the page. This would be unthinkable without XMLHttpRequest.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons XMLHttpRequest has become popular now is that browsers other than Internet Explorer have started to support it, mainly due to the fuss over its use in Gmail. The function is, by all accounts, a very simple one in technical terms: it was just a matter of someone having the idea.\n\nGetting Started with AJAX.\n\nThe first thing to do to get started with AJAX, then, is to create an XMLHttpRequest object in your Javascript code. As ever, Internet Explorer has to be difficult, doing this a different way to every other browser out there. That means that you should use this Javascript code:\n\nvar ajax;\nonload = function () {\n   if (window.ActiveXObject) {\n      ajax = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");\n   }\n   else {\n      ajax = new XMLHttpRequest;\n   }\n}\n\nWhat you've done there is declared ajax as a global variable (usable by all functions), and then created a new AJAX object when the page loads, either using ActiveX for Internet Explorer or the XMLHttpRequest function in other browsers.\n\nThe next step is to write two more functions: one to get data from a URL, and one to handle the data that comes back.\n\nfunction getText(url) {\n   ajax.open(""GET"", url, true);\n   ajax.send(null);\n}\n\najax.onreadystatechange = function () {\n   if (ajax.status == ""200"") {\n   // do things with retrieved text (in ajax.responseText)\n   }\n}\n\nAll you need to do then is call getText from the relevant part of your code with a URL you want to get text from, and put that text wherever you want it to be in the state change function.\n\nThe most powerful thing about this approach is that the URL you send to the server can contain variables, using the old REST (question marks and equals signs) way of doing things.\n\nThat means that, using the code above, you can easily send a request to ajax.php on your server, and include the current value of, say, an input box for a username on a registration form. The ajax.php script checks whether that username is already in use, and then sends either '1' or '0' as its only output. All you would then need to do is check whether ajax.responseText was 1 or 0, and change the page accordingly, preferably using getElementByID.\n\nShould I Use It?\n\nThe question remains over just how useful this is: it's certainly good for some applications where users would otherwise have to submit data over and over again, but it's not much use for smaller ones. AJAX coding has a tendency to take a lot of time, especially the first time you try it, and this is "
"Simplest way: call technical support.\n\nWhen you call customer service and choose the option to cancel your account, you get transferred to a department called ""sales"".  Their job is to try and convince you not to cancel your account.  Their performance is based on how many members they ""save"".  Talk to them if you want to get a couple free months.\n\nIf you just want to cancel without the sales pitch, call technical support.  They have access to cancel your account and would be very happy to do so because their performance is based on call time."
Monetization of a blog can be rough.  The first thing you have to do is decide on the types of ads you want to display and then look at availible networks.

"Adjust wireless antenna height, placement, alignment.   Try moving it all over.\n\nConfigure the wireless part of the router to use a different channel.  Perhaps the default channel is already being used in your area or is just really noisy.  There are channels 1-11 to choose from.  (Again this is on your wireless router configuration)  If it is on 1, change it to 6 or 11.  If it is on 11 change it to 1 or 5.   If it is on 4-6 try either 1 or 11 and see which ones are better signal.\n\nKeep in mind that the signal strength isn't the only measurement...make sure it doesn't drop the signal.  An okay signal that is stable is better than a great signal that drops out from time to time (which can happen)\n\nWhen ""tuning"" your antenna position, keep in mind that walls might have metal in them that causes interference too.  Try to provide ""line of sight"" when ever possible between wireless devices.  Glass is fine.  Maybe putting your antenna closer to the window if you are trying to get the signal somewhere else in the house... or putting it closer to a hallway so there is less physical material between the two places."
At present, Mozilla Firefox wins the race.\nVersion 1.5 introduces several new features, including an improved software update system, a new option to clear private browsing data, drag-and-drop reordering of browser tabs, and more robust pop-up blocking.\n\nAs more users continue to abandon Internet Explorer, Mozilla's popular Firefox gains traction in the browser space. Version 1.5 of Firefox offers a few notable features, foremost of which is the ability to reorder tabs by dragging and dropping them. You'll also find a tool that lets you quickly clean up your surfing history with two clicks of the mouse or a hot-key combo. The latest iteration of the browser seems more responsive than it has in the past and also is more efficient; with 10 windows open, Firefox consumed slightly less RAM than either IE or Opera.\n\nIf you're new to Firefox entirely, you'll appreciate the other features, including the RSS feeds, the JavaScript debugger, the basic download manager, and the ability to search several popular sites (such as Google) directly from the address bar. You can easily create toolbars by dragging and dropping icons. More technically minded users will appreciate that Firefox displays the page source in a new window, using indents and color-coded tags like an HTML editor. The built-in pop-up blocker is still extremely effective, and Firefox's reuptation for tight security is still well deserved. Anyone who's tired of IE will find more than one reason to like this free alternative.\n\nTop Ten Reason To Switch To Firefox:\n1. Tabbed Browsing - Makes surfing the web faster\n2. Popup Blocking\n3. Find Stuff Easier\n4. Simplified Privacy / Annoyance Eliminator\n5. Better Bookmarks and History\n6. Accessible, Intelligent, Responsive\n7. Customizable and Extendable\n8. Modern Download Manager\n9. Built for standards\n10. KISS (Keep It Simple and Straight-Forward)

"I do not know of any that would notify you when a website changes. I think the reason for that is with so many websites that have dynamic data, it would become monotonous when you are notified everytime a date changes, or some subtle part of a website changes. \n\nWebsites owners and website visitors are more apt to utilize syndication feeds on thier sites, you might have heard of RSS, or ATOM links.

"Basically if you are going to do any gaming or applications that require a fast response time you will want something that has a response time of less than or around 16ms and if it isn't you may experience a ghosting effect which causes blurry images on fast moving sequences.

Some people are more sensitive to it than others so if you aren't sure look at the monitor in a store before you buy."

Actually NAS is better known as Network Attached Storage. I currently use a 160GB Buffalo LinkStation and found it extremely easy to configure and use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe LinkStation is a network-attached storage device, but it also includes a print server, attachable via one of its two USB ports, and it creates a shared folder for use by anyone on your network. You can use the other USB port to attach an additional drive, but you have to format it with the LinkStation first.\n\nDisk performance is limited by the network. 100 megabits per second (which is only a quarter of the raw capability of USB 2.0) so almost all of the other devices that I looked at outperformed the LinkStation handily. But the convenience of having disk storage available to all of your PCs makes the slower speed bearable. Buffalo does not currently provide centralized backup software for the LinkStation, but I had no problem scheduling and initiating backups from individual PCs using Windows Backup. The network connection was more than adequate for streaming music, even to multiple PCs.\n\nI referenced the following sites when I was trying to make my choice\n\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1874,677853,00.asp\nhttp://reviews-zdnet.com.com/Buffalo_LinkStation_120GB/4505-3382_16-30639593.html\nhttp://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-207-ProdID-HDHG250LAN.php
You can have two (or more) hard drives in once machine.  The second (slave) harddrive does not need to have Windows installed on it, but it does need to be formatted by windows.  Plug in the new harddrive, boot up the machine and it will pretty much do the work for you.  Then you'll see a new drive under My Computer, and you can just drag and drop files between the two drives.\n\nDoes that answer the question?
"The rest of the partition may be used by the swap file which is not reported in Explorer.  Try reducing your swap file size.\n\nAlso, depending upon the sizes of your files, they may be taking up more disk space than the actual totals of the files.  In short, the file system can only write in fixed-length blocks (I think NTFS default is 64K).  If a file does not occupy the entire block, the rest is not used...the next file must be written to another block.  If you have tons of small files on your hard drive you may be using much more than the total sizes of the files.  There's not much way around this other than moving the files to another partition with smaller block sizes.\n\nFinally, some applications (like Photoshop) actually reserve block of space on the hard drive as ""private"" swap space.  This guarantees the application will always have a work area on the disk while its operating.  Check with the software vendor for some of your applicationsto see if this is the case and if you can either resize the reserved block, or move it to another drive."

Hello, \n\nHere are some strong reason's you should consider upgrading to XP. \n\nStability. Windows XP has the ability to run a large number of apps without running out of resources, without crashing. (If you're running Windows 2000, you already have this, so there's no gain. \nSecurity. This is a huge topic that I can't adequately cover in a few sentences suffice to say that security of your data and your privacy in Windows XP is leaps and bounds beyond anything available in Windows 9x. (Again, if you have Windows 2000, you already have most of the security capabilities of Windows XP.) \nUI enhancements. A variety of changes in Start menu, taskbar, Windows Explorer, and Control Panel make everyday tasks such as launching programs, switching between windows, and managing files just a little bit faster, easier, and more convenient. These features can each be customized, so you can use the ones you like and change others back to Windows 9x/2000 style. (Similarly, you can banish the new look of Windows XP while still enjoying its other benefits.) \nFast User Switching. Great for shared computers, FUS lets someone else log on without requiring you to first close all your documents and applications. \nPower management. Standby and hibernation let me save power (on desktop PCs as well as portables) yet still have fast boot time, bringing me right back to where I left off. (That is, all the windows that I left open when the system powers down are already open when I power up.) \nDigital photo support. I was never a fan of digital photography until I got XP because it was such a hassle before. But the support for cameras and scanners, as well as the features built in to Windows Explorer for viewing, printing, e-mailing, and manipulating images have actually made it fun and practical to work with photos in new ways. \nRemote Assistance. The ability to actually see and work with someone else's screen while conversing with them through text, voice, and video chat is a killer feature for anyone who's looked upon as a computer guru and gets calls for support from relatives, friends, and neighbors. (I suspect that includes most PIBMUG members!) \nRemote Desktop. The ability to connect with my home computer from the office (or vice versa) is awesome. It looks and acts exactly as if I'm at that computer five miles away, and I have access to all its files, printers, and other resources. And like remote assistance, it's acceptably fast if you have broadband Internet access. I also use it to work with other computers on my own LAN that's sometimes easier than hopping back and forth between two computers. \nBetter help. It's easier to navigate, integrates information from the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and includes links to a number of diagnostic tools. \n\nPlease see here for more http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=why+upgrade+from+windows+2000+to+XP&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt \n\nhttp://www.windowsusers.org/whyupgrade.html
SMIL (Synchronised Multimedia Integration Language) is an official W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) specification which offers a simple framework for creating rich media presentations from separate elements. Although support for SMIL is still far from perfect, it is one of the useful formats for creating captioned video presentations like Zeldman's Web Essentials keynote speech. \n\nA fairly detailed explanation of how the video was achieved can be found on the 'Skills for Access' site.
Web 2.0 is a term often applied to a perceived ongoing transition of the World Wide Web from a collection of websites to a full-fledged computing platform serving web applications to end users. Ultimately Web 2.0 services are expected to replace desktop computing applications for many purposes

Until the new Yahoo! mail comes out of beta -- or at least the beta goes public -- the easiest to use is Google mail.  It also gives you the most storage (more than 2.5 GB).\n\nThat said, the new Yahoo! mail is said to be more like Outlook than Google is, and the current Yahoo! mail is pretty good, so if you're used to Outlook you should probably consider getting a Yahoo! account and waiting for the new version.\n\nOf course, you can always sign up for both, and try them both out -- perhaps by signing each one up for a few mailing lists.
"There are - like in other businesses - project-stages:\nWhen you start a project and u have first results but far from finishing, its the pre-alpha-stage.\n\nAfter that, u have first results, some functions work and maybe for a first look for financiers or other people is possible, its alpha-stage. \n\nBeta-Stage is reached, when most of the functions work, the project is near completion and the bug-searching begins, or maybe the fine-tuning. \n\nAfter Beta-Stage (should come gamma-stage :) ) comes the Release. Beta-Stage is also know as testing-stage.\n\nIn Web-Pages u can see it like that:\n\nPre-Alpha: U think about what's going to be on your page\nAlpha: The basic structure is built, without any further functions or just few functions.\nBeta: Most of the functionality of your page is up and running, your friends can have a first look on it and maybe test the Forum or so...\nRelease: Its opened for business :D\n\n(For those who do not know: Alpha, Beta ... comes from the greek alphabet (<- the word ""Alphabet"" also does), where the first letters are ""Alpha"", ""Beta"", ""Gamma"" ..."

Basically it's to keep people from submitting hundreds of questions a day as a form of advertising, etc.  Once you level up (mainly by having people accept answers that you've written, or by accepting other people's answers) you can answer more, because you've generated some trust with the system.  Once you get to Level 5, you can answer an unlimited number of questions.

It is called Google Zeitgeist\n\nhttp://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html
"What you may be referring to are so-called ""virtual currencies"" that exist in many network based multi-player games like Diablo 2.\n\nIn Diablo 2, a standard (very fun and well designed) hack-and-slash fantasy game, you can gain gold be going around a killing things. Since the game is multi-player a high level character can log on with a low level character and give them lots of money.\n\nThis has brought up a question of how these digital currencies and virtual economies will work. One main question is ""How will inflation work in an economy that is continually producing more money?"" If the high level characters are constantly racking up huge amount of gold and giving it away, what makes the game difficult anymore? Many theoretical solutions have been proposed, but none has proven to be the magic bullet that solves the problem.\n\nAnother type of digital currency is the money you're holding in your bank account. Most middle class people hold money in bank accounts rather than cash, and very few will go and withdraw all of that money at once. As a result, banks take that money and lend it out elsewhere, rarely holding more than 5-10% of the original amount in actual cash. Since this is a practice of most banks, most of the money in the economy is actually virtual, going back and forth between in digital ones and zeros across the internet; very little is kept in cash form."
If you can see the windows loading screen and as soon as it gets to the desktop it blanks out, its a video card refresh rate problem or resolution problem.  Usually you monitor will say 'out of range' if that happens.  If your screen is simply going blank after the compaq spash screen, it means that your computer has sucessfully completed POST (power on self test) and you probably have an IDE device causing the hangup.  Its hard to tell whats causing the hanging unless you start disconnecting hardware.  Hook up only the hard drive (set as master) on the primary master controller with no other drives present.  Also remove any uncessary PCI cards.  It it boots up then, add one piece of hardware back in at a time until you resolve the problem by process of elimination.\n\nIt could also be a power supply issue but I would need more details of how the screen goes blank. For example, the monitor tube shuts off due to no signal, or there is just a black screen (meaning that the tube is actually displaying a black screen).  Is there a blinking cursor at the top left corner?  etc.

Whether you buy D-Link, Linksys, or any other WiFi router, encryption setup should be really simple.\n\nThe key is, well, the key.  Whether you use WEP or WPA encryption, you will need a passphrase.  Some router firmwares will generate a code for you, but you can create one yourself.  Just be sure that you make a record of it someplace in a text file.\n\nOnce you enter the passphrase in the router and reboot it, all the wireless adapters in your network will need to add that passphrase to the profile set up for your network.  Most newer adapter utilities have a Connection Wizard that helps you enter it correctly.\n\nOnce all your adapters are updated, you should be all set.  Now only those users with the correct passphrase can connect to your router.  No bandwidth thieves for you!

Also, most DVD's are dual-layer, using up to 8.5GBs of space.  DVD-R discs are all single layer and limited to 4.7 GBs.  If you have a dual-layer burner, make sure you're using dual-layer media.  If there's no copyright protection, or your burning software ignores it, it should burn fine.  Otherwise you'll need a DVD ripping application to trim the video down to 4.7GBs.

Completely uninstall your sound card and reinstall it with the latest drivers from the manufacturer.  If you have onboard audio just remove it from the device manager and restart your computer so it redetects it.  Otherwise it is possible that your sound card could have gone bad in the process of upgrading.  It would be just a case of bad timing on its part.

Anyone that uses the web or other internet technologies can benefit from learning at least the very basics of networking, for example, the difference between a telephone cable and a Cat5 ethernet cable and the places they plug into on the back of your computer. \n\nKnowing the difference between public and private networks, how data travels from one computer to another, and how to troubleshoot problems can save you money and frustration, but for many people it's easier to pay someone like me $80 an hour to fix it for them (fast).\n\nIf you work in IT or use networks on a regular basis, it would be very beneficial to study up on TCP/IP and Ethernet basics.

"Meta tags do not affect the display of a website at all, but provide useful information to web ""crawlers"", which can affect the search ratings.\n\nMany people will tell you that google ignores meta tags. While this is not totally true, google does not rely very much on meta tags because they can easily be used to misrepresent the page to get better rankings.\n\nIf you want to increase your search ranking for certain keywords, here are some tips:\n\nMake the title relivent, and include some keywords if it won't make it tacky. For example, on the index page, you could discribe your business in a few words in the title.\n\nAlso, try to use the keywords in your writing without making the text sound aqward."

Over/under-clocking is rarely a simple task on a generic computer.  If it isn't done automatically and can't be done in the BIOS (watch as your laptop boots), I would't mess with it.\n\nNext time around, make sure you get a mobile processor in your laptop instead of a desktop replacement if battery life is a concern.

"Remove the hard drive from your computer, find another working machine and plug it in there.

Hi, since you are looking for a free solution you should give a try to Debugmode's Wink. You can get it at http://www.debugmode.com/wink/. Wink does not capture audio, I believe. But, it captures the video very well.\n\nIf you were considering paying for it then your best bet would be Camtasia Studio.

It uses data compression and prefetching of content which may be cached on Google's servers to speed up page load times.\n\nThis is similar to Fasterfox for Firefox which uses unique features within the browser to uses idle bandwidth to cache and prefetch all the links on the page when you click on them.\n\nAs mikeiam20 pointed out, this is only going to make things faster on a broadband connection it will do little to nothing for dial-up.  There is NO EFFECTIVE way to speed up dial-up connections.

Mind you that many hosts (e.g. workstation, laptop) do have multiple network interfaces and could technically act as a router.\n\nIn that case if you are an authorized SNMP manager, you can try to view the machine's ipRouteTable (more on that see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2096.html.)  The table's content would tell you if this machine is configured to route/forward IP packets, hence acting as a router.

i assume you don't have a DSL router - which would be the best solution.\n\nIf you want the client machine to stay connected to the internet, you have to keep the server machine connected to DSL and keep sharing the connection. Alternatively, you could just plug that client machine into the DSL, but you'd have to set it up to login or whatever and, if you have some sort of DSL modem, you may need to restart it.\n\nOf course, that opens your second machine up to the usual internet dangers of port scanners and such.\n\nLike I said before, the best thing would be to get a DSL router that connects to the DSL where you could connect any machine to the DSL without it being dependent on any other machine, and you can set up the router to open certain ports so that a web server or Quake server can still work.

I'll basically tell you what it says once you click on the question to fix it:\n\nIf you do not wish to change your browser, 1) you click the ""Options"" link on the top-right hand; 2) click ""General Preferences"" under the ""Management"" category; 3) choose the option ""compose messages as plain text"" under the ""composing E-mails"" section; 4) scroll to the bottom and click the ""save"" button.\n\nThis is thankfully what worked for me.

It is easy.   Just go to their web site, go to the Drivers & Downloads section, and then download the drivers that you want.  Look on the printer or in the manual for the exact model before you download the driver.\n\nMake sure it is the write version of that driver for your operating system, too.\n\nThen, just exit all your applications and follow their instructions for installing the printer driver.

Dell, Gateway, and other new computer vendors also are good sources for direct purchases of used laptops.  For third party sources, I've always been happy with ubid.com, and if you study the ratings carefully, ebay can be a good source as well - my general rule is to buy from sellers who have at least a 97% satisfactory rating, and who have at least 500 transactions.
You cant, the page is only designed to show 8 friends at a time.
There is neither in existance currently.\n\nGive bush a few years and both will probably be used.
There are reasons, and mainly they have to do with power supply kicking off, pulling a lot of current and then your hard drive spin up. They are using air as bearings for the drive, so they float when running but when off sit metal on metal. \n\nIt is like starting a car, a lot of things are happening and typically that is when a car fails. \n\nAlso, if you mean just rebooting all the time, that is because windows creates virtual memory allocations of your hard drive for swap memory. These tend to get fragmented and take up a lot of memory if you just power off without shutting down. If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves.
•  Belkin Wireless Pre-N \n(*est. $130) \n\n\nMore experts recommend this router than any other—praising its range (up to 1000 feet), resistance to interference, and speed—useful for sharing data, music and video files. It uses technology anticipating the future 802.11n standard, including multiple input/multiple output (MIMO). Easy setup, a lifetime guarantee, 24/7 toll-free support, WPA security, backward compatibility and built-in parental controls make it the best-reviewed router we found. To take advantage of the extra speed, you'll need the corresponding pre-N network adapter cards (*est. $85 to $125). The Belkin is backwards compatible with older Wi-Fi 802.11b/g devices. \n\n\n\nU can buy this at ....\n\n\nhttp://www.consumersearch.com/www/computers/wireless-router-reviews/retailers.html

A couple of years ago I was having tremendous problems with a previous internet service provider that sent junk mail from their worm infested mail server...I used a program called mailwasher that used to be available for free at www.mailwasher.net. Basically this program shows you what's on the server before you download it to your email client and has a built in 'blacklist' of known spammers and such but you can choose to block/blacklist or bounce messages or do all three. By bouncing messages and adding them to the blacklist, you do 2 things, you tell mail washer to mark that message as spam if it comes in again and if you bounce it, chances are that you will be automatically removed from the list that is sending the messages.  One click and the unwanted spam is deleted and you dont have to download it at all to your computer. It really helped clear out my inbox, however, since switching ISPs, I dont have that much of a problem and I also use Thunderbird available at mozilla.org and set up message filters which work well.

Hopefully, this isn't something that you've already tried and been frustrated with, but...\nReally, the Scheduled Tasks capability that is built into XP is great! If you've already tried it, then don't bother with this. But hopefully, this will work:\n\n- In Start, click Control Panel.\n- Now if your Control Panel is in Category View (you'll know it is if it has a blue bkground instead of white), then click 'Performance and Maintenance'. Otherwise, just ignore this part and keep going with the next step.\n- Click 'Scheduled Tasks'\n- Now, open the 'Add Scheduled Task' wizard that's at the top of the list.\n- 'Next' button\n- If your app. is on the list, just select it. Otherwise, 'Browse' for it.\n- Now whatever settings you need: Daily, Weekly, etc. Note: if you want biweekly or something similar, then choose 'weekly' right now.\n- Your exact schedule for the program.\n- Enter the password, if you have one. If you don't, then don't worry about it.\n- Check the box for advanced settings.\n- Now if you didn't have a password, then it will bring up an error. Just click 'OK' and we'll take care of it soon.\n- Now in the properties box, you'll have to check 'Run only if logged on', unless you have a password entered.\n- Take a look at the schedule, make sure it's right -- you have a lot more settings available here than in the wizard.\n- And now, for stopping the program. Under the 'Settings' tab, make sure to check the box 'Stop the task if it runs for...' and enter your time limit. Sorry, I don't know how to make it end at a time on the clock, but since it starts at a specific time, you can effectively make it do that by setting the time limit.\n\nDoes that work? I'd love to know.\n\nMuch easier than writing a program -- let's not reinvent the wheel. :)
It the worst case, none of the 0's is in the correct place, so it will take 4 swaps to put them in the correct the first 4 slots of the array. That leaves you with 7 1s and 9 2s. It will take you 7 swaps to get the 1s into the correct positions. The worst case will look like: 11112222222221110000\n\nIn general if you have n objects in broken into subsets, it will take you minimum of n - (size of largest subset) exchanges to get them into position by swapping. Swap all the smaller subsets into position first, and the largest subset will end up in the correct position.

Spam has to do with email so there isn't much you can do there, that has nothing to do with the Operating system.  Also, there is little to no adware/spyware on the Mac, again because it is harder to execute on OSX and because the user base is so low for the Mac OSX platform.\n\nAnd your last part...if so, what?

You absolutely can!  DSL is deregulated, meaning you can get your DSL service from any DSL provider in your area.  While some service providers have restrictions on their subscriptions (i.e. having to purchase your local phone service from them as well), it is ILLEGAL for your phone company to deny you DSL service from any other providers in your area, just like it is ILLEGAL for them to deny you local phone service from any other providers in your area.\n\nThere are several DSL providers nationwide (SBC, Verizon, Covad, PacBell (in California), etc.).\n\nA quick search of Yahoo gave the following:\n\nhttp://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/Broadband/Digital_Subscriber_Line__DSL_/\n\nHowever, your options as to whom provides DSL in your area may be limited.

There are many reasons why you cannot access your e-mail account, although I have noticed that Yahoo will randomly take accounts off line for anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, especially if they see that there isn't very much activity on those accounts.\n\nPerhaps they do this if they're uploading new ads, or if one of their servers is having some problems. They have been known to disable certain accounts for awhile, although they usually put those accounts back on line within 3 weeks or thereabouts. Of course, they're certainly not going to admit to doing this, as you could imagine the number of complaints they would receive!\n\nOutside of that scenario, double check your username and password for spelling errors, as typos are the most common reason why people cannot access their e-mail accounts.

phising is the attempt to obtain sensitive information by trying to fool a user to input sensitive data into what he/she believes is a real/secure form or email.  \n\nFor instance you might receive an email saying that something happened with your paypal account and they ask you to click in some link, that looks like the real deal ie something.paypal.com, which takes you to a webpage with a form, it will ask you to put some personal information to log on or continue; when you hit the submit button the information will go to someone else not paypal, thus someone getting your sensitive data which might be use for malicious purposes.

"I'm not sure how you've got your Firefox set up. It may be just the default settings we're dealing with here, or it might even be the result of a funky extension causing some issues. Either way, though, I'm going to tell you how I've got my browser set up to handle links that open in a new window (e.g. pop-ups). Of course it's first important to distinguish that these pop-ups you describe are the good pop-ups. I mean you probably still want Firefox to block the JavaScript pop-ups from showing. No problem, however, because my method won't bother those settings! So, deep breath. Here we go.\n\nFirst, read up on editing your user.js file at [1]. Next, download and place the following file from [2] in your profile folder. Make sure Firefox is closed when doing this.

You need an image host. You can find this at such places as http://photobucket.com (my personal favorite), or even http://www.picrack.com/ and just sign up, host it, and then bingo, copy and past the URL that the picture is located and you're all set.
The host is the computer or server you are connecting to; the client is the computer you are connecting from.

"Just because the laptop has an external video connection does not mean it supports a seperate display.\nLet me clarify:  Most laptops are fully capable of what is called ""mirroring.""  This is what you're seeing.  Certain laptop video cards in recent years do allow you to split your desktop so that you can see different views on each available screen.\nFrom looking at the general specs on IBM's website (see sources) it mentions a 16MB ATI Radeon 7500 video card.  The second link in Sources is the direct link to the *standard graphics card's specifications.\nIf it was capable of allowing you to split the video signal to both the Laptop's built in screen and the external monitor, it would state something like ""dual channel supported."""
"Sims 2 by far.\n\nOne of the best things is a more intelligent AI.

Add to that things like community lots and I wonder why anybody would want to continue to play the original."
Search engines follow all links on a website.

You could use a crossover cable if both pc's have ethernet cards.  Join them in a Mircosoft network.

This is hard to do if you have never done it before.\nOther method which only need sequencial (not concurrent) computer use:\nOne product that I have used sucessfully is Norton's Ghost.  This is especially good if the new computer has a blank hard drive.\nAnother method is to use a cd writer from the old machine to copy the file to a CD-rom which can then be read on the new pc.\nFinally and external hard drive (or less expensively, a flash drive) could be used to copy the files.\nData files are easier to transfer than programs (which usually have to be installed on the new computer).

iPod is a brand of portable digital media player designed and marketed by Apple Computer. Devices in the iPod family provide a simple user interface designed around a central scroll wheel (with the exception of the iPod shuffle). Most iPod models store media on a built-in hard drive, while the smaller iPod shuffle and iPod nano use flash memory. Like most digital audio players, an iPod can serve as an external data storage device when connected to a computer. Discontinued versions of the iPod include two generations of the popular iPod mini and four generations of the full-sized iPod, all of which had monochrome screens except for the fourth-generation iPod with color screen (previously sold as iPod photo before it replaced the monochrome iPod in the top line). As of January 2006, the lineup consists of the fifth-generation iPod which can play videos, the iPod nano which has a color screen, and the iPod shuffle; all three iterations were released in 2005. The iPod is currently the world's best-selling digital audio player.\n\nThe bundled software used for uploading music, photos, and videos to the iPod is called iTunes. iTunes is a music jukebox application that stores a comprehensive library of the music on a user's computer, as well as being able to play and rip it from a CD. The most recent incarnations of iPod and iTunes have video playing and organization features. Other forms of data can be added to iPod as if it were a normal data storage device.
I think you can't. There are two reasons for that.\n1.) Yahoo does not necessarily show the yahoo id of the person asking or answering question. You can create an alias or a nick name.\n2.) You can not search on the basis of person's name. There is no options in the advanced search also.\n\nI personally feel that this setting is right. If I am asking questions, why should I be known to people.\n\nHope it helps.
Connect the data cable (IDE) exactly how the hard drive has been connected.  Usually, if you connect it the wrong way, it won't go into the drive at all.  If you are in doubt, refer to the manual that came with the drive or on the box.\n\nUsually, the jumpre has to be set to slave since the hard drive is the master.  If you have two IDE cables there are 4 options: Primary master and primary slave and Secondary master and secondary slave.  Your hard drive usually will be connected to  primary master.  So, depending upon your choice and any other connected drives set the appropriate option and jumper settings.  These settings are mentioned on the drive itself.  First verify the jumper settings of your hard drive.

It all really depends on what type of application has the port open.  For instance, if you are running a web server you would most likely see port 80 and perhaps 443 for a secure web site. If you had an FTP server running, you would see port 21 open.  To gain access to these various ports, it is best to use the application intended (ie. Web browser, FTP client, etc.) If you want to make a raw connection to an open port you can sometimes uses the telnet protocol and add the port number to the end.  Drop to DOS and type 'telnet <ip# of computer w/open port> <port#>' like this:  'telnet 127.0.0.1 25'  This would connect you to a SMPT server running on your local computer (port# 25).

There are different formats for CD, like CD-Audio, VCD, SVCD etc, each format has its own way to store data. If we are talking about CD-Audio Standards then it can store upto 80 minutes of sound recording, this will be stored on tracks, you can not store these tracks to your computer hard disk. If you want to store your audio cd on your computer then you have to convert it (RIP) into mp3 or wma format using Media Player 10 or any other Ripper, it will convert the CD-Audio track into almost 4mb file. but remember its another standard.\nThe best way to check whether your car sound system play mp3 or not is that try to play an mp3 CD in it. :)

It will be slow and agonizing, the slow upstream.  There are dynamic dns services you can subscribe to.  I know they have them for windows os, so they might have a linux one too.  However how it works is you pay like $20 a year and install their utility on your webserver.  So the utility on your server will send an update like every hour to their dns server.  It will update their dns to your new IP and your domain will continue to feed people to the right place.\n\nhttp://www.no-ip.com\ndynamicdns.com

I can take a reasonable guess not having looked at how it's implemented...\n\nOnce the object exists there will be almost no difference. Remember, a class is simply a collection of functions that have protected access to a group of variables. The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store. Putting them in objects is simply more convenient in so many ways. You pay a tiny bit in performance for that, but you probably use less developer resources (if they count here).

Assuming you have a computer that you want to connect to the Wireless network, either right click on the wireless connection icon in the system tray or go to Start > Control Panel > Network Connections and right click on that, then click on View Available Wireless Networks, when your Network shows up (it will probably be the only one in range anyway) you will want to click Connect when you do Windows will ask you to enter the Network Key (the WEP key) two times so make sure you enter it correctly both times.  You will then be able to connect to the network.  Though, you only need this when connecting wirelessly.

hello again.  thank you for choosing my previous answer as 'best answer'.  so sorry to hear you are still having problems.\n\ni, too would recommend replacing the cyan printhead.  it should run no more than $34.  Item number is HP c4921a.  Some printer units out there usually do not print ANYTHING if there carts/printheads are bad.  but they usually refuse to move at all.\nto replace the machine with the updated one would run you about $200.- $250.  so you need 2 decide if you want 2 put more in2 this 1, or scrap the idea and get a new 1.  i'd hate to see you be only $34 away from having the printer work flawlessly, and on the other hand, you don't want 2 nickle and dime you in2 the $200. price where you could have gotten a brand new one.\ndouble check with HP, i think they can be a great asset.  i think they also have a buy back program, where they will buy your old machine back.  they only give $50, but i'm not sure if this is limited to handheld units or not.\ngood luck - have fun!! - hope this helps.

Do the following to remove it:\n\n(1) Start Yahoo Messenger\n(2) Press Control D (Both simultaneously). Alternately,  go to messenger menu and then press Sign Out option.\n\nMission Achieved! Now Sign in using your username and password. Hope this answers your query!
I think, you can probably do it by using remote desktop (no third party software involved, it's part of Windows Utility). Although I dont know details of how you can do it, I am sure you will find plenty of ways to do it on forums. Try eng-tips forum or search in google groups. I have had a good experience with these in past.\n\nHope it helps!
There should be no reason why you can't send messages. \n\nI think you should write to the rediff help team and ask them why this is happening. \n\nI would suggest trying a few more times though.\n\nAll the best!
Most scanners today are variations of the desktop (or flatbed) scanner. Hand-held scanners, where the device is moved by hand, were briefly popular but are now not used due to the difficulty of obtaining a high-quality image. Both these types of scanners use a charge-coupled device (CCD) as the image sensor, whereas a drum scanner uses a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor.\n\nOther types of scanners are planetary scanners, which take photographs of books and documents, and laser range scanners, for producing three-dimensional models of objects.\n\nDrum scanners:\n--------------\nDrum scanners, the oldest scanning technology, have a scanning photomultiplier tube, which moves back and forth along a single axis. The image to be scanned is soaked in oil, then wrapped around the drum; this process is known as dry mounting. The drum then rotates in front of the photomultiplier tube. The use of drum scanners has declined significantly as flatbed scanners based on charge-coupled devices have dropped in price; however, drum scanners are still used for certain high-end applications, such as museum-quality archiving of photographs, desktop publishing, and print production of books and magazines. They are very expensive. Only few companies manufacture them. Due to the fact that a photomultiplier tube is much more sensitive to light than a charge-coupled device and the scanning beam can be focused very narrowly, drum scanners can produce scans superior to those of flatbed scanners, both in resolution and in the gradations of color and brightness. Also, since drum scanners have the advantage for resolution, their use is generally recommended when a scanned image is going to be greatly enlarged.

What site?  Did you try pinging it?
If you login to Yahoo! Mail, it will show your available capacity near the top right (below the banner ad, in the form of '1% of 1.0GB').\n\nI believe that 1 gigabyte is the capacity for new accounts, but I am not certain.
It all depends on what the program is, and its specific system requirements.\n\nCertain programs (like Word, Powerpoint) could care less about what type of processor it is, as long as the system is running WIndows.\n\nOther software, like ProTools, has very specific hardware requirements, and deviating from their favorites list will just cause you much drama.\n\nOther software can flip-flop either way. MS-Excel for example acts the same with both CPU's until you get into some super large numbers (2 to the 50th power or something like that) or extremely complex mathematical formulae (like what brokerage firms or actuaries might use). AMD processes mathematical calculations slightly different than Intel, and it will show up in complex calculations.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is to check the programs' system requirements.
Hi James,\n\nSorry for not being abble to answer any of your questions :(\nDo you remember when you answered me about favicon.ico? You were right!\nI just don´t know how to do what you´ve instructed, because I think your instructions were to web developers. I´m saing this because I´ve just found a site which teach exactly what you told me, but it´s for programmers not for ordinary users, as I am.\n\nPlease, take a look at it:
The standard for low bandwith video telephony and multimedia.Comparing with mp3,mp4 can plays videos.\nPlus mp4 allows streaming over the internet. It also allows multiplexing of multiple video and audio streams in one file, variable frame- and bit-rates, subtitles and still images. Apple's QuickTime file format was the design starting point of the *.mp4 file format. Although *.mp4 still resembles the QuickTime format, it has been improved upon in many different ways.\nI hope this will help u.
You need the software for the shopping cart.(ie. Miva Merchant), then you need to set up the payment gateway. You may also, if you don't have one already, get a digital cert. so your customers will know that their transaction is secure.
HP always seems to be very expensive (for what they give you) and EVERYONE I've ever known who went with HP (printer,scanner,laptop) had SOME sort of issue that was very difficult, ans sometimes costly to solve.\n\nSony was behind the recent XPC spyware fiasco.\n\nThis doesn't exactly answer your question, but maybe it helps you narrow down the choices.
depends. pc2700 is better because it is faster memory than pc2100. But, remember, if you have a pc/laptop that accepts pc2100, then you can put a pc2700 memory in it but it will not make your laptop faster. It works only because all memory modules are backward compatible and work with old slots but will not be able to take advantage of the speed capabilities of the newer memory modules.
Most avatars are made up by people with a lot of free time and photoshop. Just use a search engine to find a image you like and use a image editing program to add a witty saying or something. To make a animated avatar (call a .gif) you can try finding a program that makes them or find them online. Try gif.com they have a few of them.

"paste special lets you choose what of the cell you want to paste.\n\nfor example, if you have a formula that's calculating averages, and you want to move the answer to a second location, if you do ""regular"" cut and paste, then the formula will update to the new location, giving you a screwy value.  but with ""paste special"" you can copy just the value of the cell to the new location.  this also lets you copy just the borders, formatting, comments, formulas, or any number of cool things.  i've personally found it most helpful in dealing with formulas and borders, but there's probably a gazillion other applications."
If both of them are routers then you only need one of them. I don't know what models you have so there might be different things on each router that you might want. If you need both then I would hook up the wireless one 1st and then http to the ip address and check the wireless settings.

"Hi,\nAVG is one of the best; available from http://www.grisoft.com. The free version is good. I bought the ""buy"" version for 33 dollars US for two years.

An Oracle Database Administrator holds a key role in keeping the system up and running and hence, whatever business it supports up and running. It is a very technical role. They are typically the ones who move objects (tables, views, triggers, functions...) from one environment to the next (Development-->test-->production). They work closely with developers who write software to read/write/update/delete data to and from the database.  They monitor database size allocations and make adjustments for growth. they determine proper data elements that should be used for indexes so that searches against the database run quickly for customers. There is much more. It is a demanding job and they are often the first ones who are required to 'get the system back up and running' when the database goes nutty. (like when someone accidently submits a wacked out query doing a full table scan.\na SUN administrator is different than a DBA because they do not focus on the database but they keep the server hardware running that the database runs on. They monitor server performance and deploy other custom written unix or java applications that programmers have developed. they too get involved with 'getting the system back up' when something goes haywire. It is also a very technical role and requires great knowledge of the unix commands and operating system.

Depends on what you want to do, as with anything else. If you're working with LAMP systems (linux, mysql, php) I know a lot of people who prefer Mac laptops because they have unix underneath and they can just go into the command prompt to do a lot of stuff for development without messing up their production environment.
The service provider usually provides you the facility of keeping track of your MB/GB usage. You can also call their helpline to know the same at any time.

Since China is a communist country and doesn't practice democracy, freedoms are very limited. The government doesn't want the Chinese people to have unlimited information to the rest of the world. If they do, then the people will realize how little freedom they have compared to the US. Also by banning sites, China is banning opportunities for demonstrations/uprisings, which could lead to violence. That could lead to international attention and would cause China to lose face.

I agree partially with the post above.  You should uninstall the drivers you have by going to Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  You should see something along the lines of NVidia TNT Drivers or whatnot.  Reboot the computer.  A generic windows driver will be installed so that you can still see the desktop, but it will look like crap.  Go to www.nvidia.com and download the latest drivers for your specific adapter.  Once installed, reboot the system if it doesn't reboot automatically, then when you get back to windows, right click the desktop and go to properties, click the settings tab, and reset your resolution and color depth as necessary.  You can also click the advanced button and tweak your refresh rate and other video settings here.  good luck.\n\nI should add that you can also uninstall the drivers using the device manager...but the add/remove programs method will help ensure that all registry entries and whatnot are removed.  This helps eliminate compatibility issues with later driver versions.

"Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\n\nThe term ""personal digital assistant"" was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\n\nPDAs are some times refered to as ""Palms"" or ""Palm Pilot"" after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc. This usage is a case of genericized trademark, similar to refering to a tissue as a ""Kleenex""; or a bandage as a ""Band-Aid"".\n\nThe currently major PDA operating systems are:\n\nPalm OS - owned by Palm, Inc. \nWindows Mobile (Pocket PC), (based on the Windows CE kernel) - owned by Microsoft \nBlackBerry - owned by Research In Motion \nMany operating systems based on the Linux kernel - free (not owned by any company) These include: \nGPE - Based on GTK+/X11 \nOPIE/Qtopia - based on Qt/E Qtopia is developed by Trolltech, OPIE is a fork of Qtopia developed by volunteers \nSymbian OS (formerly EPOC) owned by Ericsson, Panasonic, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericsson \nMany PDAs run using a variation of the ARM architecture (usually denoted by the Intel XScale trademark). This encompasses a class of RISC microprocessors that are widely used in mobile devices and embedded systems, and its design was influenced strongly by a popular 1970s/1980s CPU, the MOS Technology 6502.\n\nAccording to a Gartner market study, the overall market for PDAs grew by 20.7% in the third quarter (Q3) of 2005, compared to Q3 2004, with marketshare resolving as follows (by operating system):\n\nPalm OS for Palm, Inc. PDAs and some other licensees- 14.9% (declining) \nWindows Mobile for PDAs that comply with the Microsoft's Pocket PC specifications - 49.2% (increasing) \nBlackBerry OS for BlackBerry PDA (produced by Research In Motion) - 25.0% (increasing) \nSymbian OS - 5.8% (increasing) \n\nPopular PDAs\n \nPalm IIIxe PDAPsion \nApple Computer Newton \nBlackBerry \nhp iPAQ Pocket PC (Originally Compaq iPAQ until HP merged in 2002) \nPalm Pilot, Tungsten, LifeDrive, Treo and Zire \nSharp Wizard and Zaurus \nSony CLIÉ \nTapwave Zodiac \nAlphaSmart Dana \nDell Axim \nGMate Yopy \nFujitsu Siemens Loox 720 \nList of PalmOS Devices \nAbacus_PDA_Watch \n\nVarious operating systems based on the Linux kernel for various special designed PDAs (many other supported) - 0.7% (stable) \nOther - 4.4% (stable) \nThe reason usually cited for the resumption in PDA market growth (after market declines in 2002 - 2004) is the growing interest in PDAs offering wireless email capabilities (such as BlackBerries), and PDAs with built-in GPS capabilities for navigation. Smartphones — mobile phones with PDA-like abilities will likely curtail PDA growth in the near future, as smartphones are becoming very popular."

Hey, just bringing this old question up for a vote.
A bugtracker is a ticket tracking system that is designed especially to manage problems (software bugs) with computer programs.\n\nTypically bug tracking software allows the user to quickly enter bugs and search on them. In addition some allow users to specify a workflow for a bug that automates a bug's lifecycle.\n\nMost bug tracking software allows the administrator of the system to configure what fields are included on a bug.\n\nHaving a bug tracking solution is critical for most systems. Without a good bug tracking solution bugs will eventually get lost or poorly prioritized.\n\nDirectory for Software Development\nThe most useful links to\nDefect Tracking Tools Sites  provided by\n\nQ-Success \n 95 Hand-picked Defect Tracking Tools Sites \n\n\nclick here for further details:\n\nhttp://www.software-pointers.com/en-defecttracking-tools.html
Some sites automatically log you out eventually as a safety precaution. While it is a favor for your security, it can be a hassle if you like to keep an internet site open. I would email the site administrators and see if  they have any special cookie settings necessary or see if they automatically log you out after a certain time period or certain amount of inactivity. \nRock ON!
wow you should've seen me the first time my dell laptop got dirty...i tried everything\n\nif you don't want to buy anything for it, take a soft cloth and use a little bit of warm water...wipe the screen lightly from right to left starting a new row with each stroke...\n\nPS. the warm water streaks doesn't streak whereas the cold does..but don't use burning hot water\n\nhowever, if you're screen is merely dusty, theres no need to wet the cloth at all...but if it's dirty as in little specs, then wet it a little\n\nhope this helps and ur screen is squeeky clean

There is a common misconception about PAT and NAT.\n\nPAT\nThis is a many to one solution. In this situation you have multiple machines talking to one firewall and then the firewall talks to the destination machine with your information but with the firewall as the return address. The firewall then receives the information the passes it on to you with the received IP being the orginal distant end.\n\nNAT\nWith NAT you need to have multiple ARIN routable IPs assigned to the public side of the firewall. This allows your private IPs to pick up a public firewall IP and hold on to it when talking. This is what many companies do to protect their webservers. When they have multiple inside webservers with multiple inside IPs they program the firewall to point one outside IP to a specific inside IP.\n\nMost home routers from linksys and dlink use PAT but they just call it NAT since this is how everyone knows it.

My understanding of the law is that you are allowed to make a backup copy of a DVD that you make.  For example a DVD movie of you and your friend.  \n\nYou are not allowed under the law to buy a DVD of a Hollywood movie and then back it up to your Hard drive.  \n\nFor example in the united States you are allowed to buy a Music CD and rip it into a MP3 file on your computer yet for movies this is not allowed.  \n\nI was watching a episode #1 of on confused Nerd TV and they were talking about this exact situation.\n\nHere is a copy of conversation they were having.\n\nBandwidth is not decreasing, you know. It's an incredible lesson, when I first put my server together over six years ago it was a little bit of a strain. It could barely compress things in real time. Now I stick a CD in there and get it all ripped and compressed in under five minutes. It's just little corner of most people's hard disks. So the next things are the movies, which have an order of magnitude size of information, so I've started doing those as well. I put together a movie server for myself that now has over 500 works on it.\nBob: Really?\nAndy: It's illegal, because one of the worst laws I'm aware of, the DMCA says that even though I buy the DVD I can't copy it onto my computer.\nBob: I forgot you are a criminal.\nAndy: I'm a criminal in more ways than one.\nBob: Our new Attorney-General will be watching this.\n\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/transcripts/001.html\n\nYou can watch episode #1 here.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/

you can buy a wier connection that would attach to video card and than has two outputs but in this case you would just get a mirror emage on booth monitors good for presentation kind of thing ( kind of Cheap)\n\nif you whant to open say diffrent Internet Explorer windows with say two diffrent webpages one one each monitor and move the mouse inbetween booth you need to buy a speciall video card that would support that  you would find video card that would support even more than two monitors ( kind of expensive)
Ethernet connects to your computer, sometimes you have the USB option.
"One of the most important factors, that nobody else ever seems to care about (and it pisses me off to no end), is the RESOLUTION of the monitor. And I've never seen an LCD tv that has a resolution higher than 1280*1024 (an ""amazing"" performance, achieved in the last millennium by over 99% of the common 17"" CRT monitors and many 15"" monitors too).\n\nThe 27"" beast you mention makes no exception; its resolution is even lower: 1280*720. My Viewsonic VA1912w (19"") already beats it (1440*900) and my (older) 19"" CRT totally humiliates it (1600*1200). Even my 15"" laptop screen has 1400*1050.\n\nWhat this means (having a HUGE monitor with a low resolution) is that you won't have more pixels on the screen (actually, you'll probably have less), but the pixels will be larger.\nJust like zooming into a low-resolution image. It gets bigger but it doesn't look any better.\n\nNow, 1280*1024 is plenty enough for TV (and HDTV), so that display is perfectly good for watching TV, from a comfortable distance. And this is the key: it is a TV, not a computer monitor! It's probably good enough for games too, because games don't need very high resolutions. What matters for games is the low latency for fast and impressive action.\n\nHowever, if you want to do serious graphics, don't settle for anything less than 1600*1200. It's just not worth it. And you can find that resolution (or higher) in LCD monitors (not TVs!) starting from 20""."

Yes there is.  Not only is the AGP bus technology more advanced than PCI, the video cards available for AGP slots are generally alot faster/better than ones available for PCI slots.  For example, in the previous generation of video cards the most powerful nvidia PCI video card was the FX5500 while the most powerful nvidia AGP video card was the FX5900 (higher model numbers are better than lower ones).  With the current generation of video cards, I don't even think any PCI versions are available.

Hardwired systems are made to perform in a set manner, implemented with logic, switches, etc. between any input and output in the system. Once the manner in which the control is executed, you can not change the behavior of the system.\n\nMicroprogrammed systems are centered around a computer of some sort, often a microcontroller in small systems, that controls the system using a program. Input is sent to the computer, and the program determines what should be done with the input to come up with an output. So the processor is between the input and the output, rather than a direct link between the input and output.\n\nThe vesatility of the microprogrammed system far exceeds the hardwired system. The systems can also be considerably smaller. The size of a complex microcontroller can be quite a bit smaller that a bunch of logic and switches for the same functionality.\n\nThis what you were looking for?

"No one person invented the Internet as we know it today. However, certain major figures contributed major breakthroughs:\n\n(1) Leonard Kleinrock was the first to publish a paper about the idea of packet switching, which is essential to the Internet. He did so in 1961. \n\n(2) J.C.R. Licklider was the first to describe an Internet-like worldwide network of computers, in 1962. He called it the ""Galactic Network.""\n\n(3) Larry G. Roberts created the first functioning long-distance computer networks in 1965 and designed the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the seed from which the modern Internet grew, in 1966.\n\n(4) Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which moves data on the modern Internet, in 1972 and 1973.\n\n(5) By 1983, TCP was the standard and ARPANET began to resemble the modern Internet in many respects. The ARPANET itself was taken out of commission in 1990. Most restrictions on commercial Internet traffic ended in 1991, with the last limitations removed in 1995. NCSA Mosaic web browser also came out in 1993, the first browser that supported both text and graphics.\n\nFor an excellent article on history and evolution of the Internet, refer to the following links:\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\n\nOn the lighter side, as popularly said, 'Al Gore' invented the internet.

"How to Install a Wireless Network by CNET\n\nStep 1:\nGetting started\nA broadband connection brings the Internet into your home at blazing speeds. And with a wireless, or Wi-Fi, network, you can get that access on multiple computers throughout your home--and even outside it--without cords. What's more, today's wireless-networking products make broadband Internet sharing easy, inexpensive, and secure. In this Weekend Project, we'll show you how to distribute broadband Internet access among multiple notebook or desktop systems, and we'll walk you through the necessary steps to keep your network protected.\n\nThe core of a Wi-Fi network is a wireless router or gateway. We used the D-Link DI-624 AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g router, which sells for $99 before a $20 rebate. You'll also need a wireless adapter for each system that connects to the network. We installed two D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g wireless adapters: a DWL-G650 PC Card adapter for a Windows 2000 notebook PC ($65 before a $10 rebate) and a DWL-G520 PCI adapter for a secondary desktop running Windows XP Home Edition ($69 before a $10 rebate). The primary PC, connected to the router via an Ethernet cable, was running Windows XP Professional.\n\nStep 2:\nWhat you'll need\nBefore you get started with this project, we recommend that you have the following:\n\n* A wireless router\n* Wireless adapters and/or a wireless-enabled system or laptop\n* A broadband connection to the Internet (typically via cable or DSL modem)\n* An Ethernet cable\n* Pen and paper to write down current network settings, such as IP and MAC addresses\n\n* The IP address assigned to your system by your ISP if you use a static IP address\n* If you use DSL, the username and password assigned to you by your ISP\n* The MAC address for all wireless network adapters\n\nStep 3:\nPrepare for installation\nYou may need a few bits of information to set up your router correctly. Double-click the Network Connections icon within Control Panel and right-click the icon for your PC's Ethernet adapter. Then choose Properties > Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) > Properties. If ""Use the following IP address"" is highlighted, your Internet access uses a static IP address. Jot down the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway. Then click ""Obtain an IP address automatically."" Click OK to apply your changes and OK again to close the dialog.\n\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\n\nIf you have a DSL connection, you'll probably need the username and the password your system requires to connect to your ISP. If you don't know the values, try looking within the software your ISP provided. You may need to uninstall the PPPoE connection software that your ISP provided. To find out, check your router's documentation.\n\nNow is also a good time to collect the MAC addresses of any wireless-network adapters you'll be installing. The MAC address should be printed on the Wi-Fi PC Card or the PCI adapter.\n\nStep 4:\nInstall the router\n\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\n\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nBefore you install the router, power down your PC and modem, then disconnect the Ethernet cable from your PC and connect it to your router's WAN port so that the Ethernet cable connects the modem to the route"
The Google sponsors links are okay because they're fairly small and plain.  I just hate big flashing banners :(
Ok first off save yourself a lot of trouble and don't call your ISP they will waste your time and will not support your router config anyway. Check out the link listed below. One tip if you have DSL the setting is PPPoE. Hope this helps

"computers store this information in a CMOS chip that uses a small battery to retain the information when the computer is shut off. \n\nCMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) is type of chip that consumes very little power; therefore, while the computer is turned off, the battery discharges very slowly. But the battery will totally discharge if you leave your computer turned off for a year or so. Even if you turn your computer on every day, the battery is designed to last only a couple of years. Occasionally a battery will fail prematurely. \n\nToday’s plug-and-play computers can detect most of the necessary settings, but if your CMOS battery is dead, your computer will not be able to retain the date and time. The computer will also lose any custom settings, for example, the boot sequence. If you set a password in CMOS, you may be locked out of the computer. If the CMOS battery does fail, you might receive the message ""System Configuration Lost"" when you start the computer. It would be wise to record all the CMOS settings as a precaution. \n\nTo record the CMOS settings, watch for an on-screen prompt when you first start your computer. The prompt tells you to press a key, usually the Del or F2, to enter CMOS. To enter the CMOS configuration utility, you have to press the indicated key while the message is on the screen. After the CMOS configuration screen appears, follow the instructions provided to page through all the screens and record all the settings. \n\nIf your computer loses its time setting overnight, the CMOS battery may not be holding a charge. The CMOS battery is located inside the case on the motherboard. Changing the battery is usually a job for a computer technician. In fact, a layman might not even be able to find the battery. \n\nIf you want to locate the CMOS battery in your computer, be aware that a static discharge from your hands can damage components inside the case. After taking proper precautions, open the case and look on the motherboard for a battery. If you have a diagram of your motherboard, locate the battery on the diagram first. \n\nDifferent motherboards use different types of batteries. The battery may be shaped like a barrel or a coin. Some motherboards use a component that resembles a chip which contains the CMOS and the battery (made by DALLAS or Benchmarq). Batteries come in different voltages, so make sure you get an exact replacement. \n\nSometimes the battery is mounted in a holder. Sometimes it is soldered to the motherboard. De-soldering and re-soldering a battery is usually a job for a computer technician. An inexperienced solderer can cause a lot of damage. If you want to try to do it yourself, first practice on an obsolete circuit board. You may change your mind. \n\nIf the CMOS battery has failed because it’s too old, this might be an opportunity to upgrade your motherboard. When upgrading a motherboard, the most important considerations are to make sure the new motherboard is the correct form factor for your case, and that the new motherboard has the correct bus connector slots for your expansion boards."
the error occurs if there is any of your report calculation is divide by zero. for eg. you have a salary field (eg.5000) and you are calculating salary for for day. so in your report you will give like salary/30 . this will work fine if the salary fiels is having value grater than zero. if the salary value is zero in the database then this error will occur. so check your database. also if the result is grater than the field length , this error will occur. check both and reply. \nHappy programming.

its the amount if pins on the processor, thus a 754 wont fit into a 939 or visa versa.\n754 was the first mainstream amd64 socket. the max cpu that will be made for it is the 3700amd64. it is going to now be the budget line so it wont be developed a whole lot further as for as mainboard features. it does not feature dual channel memory.\nskt939 is the current enduser socket. processor speeds are going beyond dual core 4800+ processors so there is a definate upgrade path. it can handle dual channel memory. the motheboards have features like the nf4 chipset including SLI, pci-express, better sata options, and more. since better chips/chipsets are being manufactured on 939 it is also perferred for overclockers and \nThe major difference between S754 and S939 is that S939 processors have a 128-bit memory controller and the S754 has a 64-bit memory controller. In other words, dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it, from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI, PCI-E, etc), those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards, simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money.

Best Answer - Chosen By Voters\n\nThe negative usage of hacker is one who exploits systems or gains unauthorized access through clever tactics and detailed knowledge, that is, through the use of a hack. However, because most hacks do not exploit systems or gain unauthorized access, most people who have enough technical skill to produce clever hacks consider the use of the word hacker in this sense to be bigotry. Malicious hackers in this sense are often called black hat hackers, but it is more appropriate to call them crackers as this is a term which distinguishes the exploitation of security weaknesses from hacking in general. The opposite term of black hat hackers, White hat, are those who attempt to break into systems or networks in order to help the owners of the system by making them aware of security flaws, or to perform some other altruistic activity. Other hackers often viewed negatively include phreakers and software crackers.

Yes and No.\n\nFor the average user, the new MacBook Pro offers faster startup time and many applications that are designed for the new (to Apple) Intel processor that will run faster than before.  \n\nThis is one side of the story.  Many computer users choose Apple for use in design projects ranging from graphics to film editing.  Applications like Apple's own Final Cut Pro, Motion, and non Apple programs like Photoshop (Macromedia)  will most likely run faster on the older Powerbook G4s because they are not written to work natively with Intel processors.  This does not mean these programs will not work on the MacBook Pro, they will just run slower because they require a special (invisible) program to allow them to run on the Intel processor.  \n\nFor the average user, however, the MacBook Pro is well worth it.

yes, u can definitely connect 2 computers together with a USB. Make sure your usb cable is the special kind, that is there's a box or some thing fat sticking out of the cable.

Well...Yes...Anywhere there is a Wireless Access Point (WAP) available.  And now-a-days, this is pretty much anywhere.\n\nGo to Starbucks, or McDonalds, or Holiday Inn....Or just a crowded neighborhood and you're bound to find one.\n\nOf course, if the WAP is secured, you'll need to know the password to connect.\n\nNow, the alternative is a WWAN card.  This is what Verizon and Sprint are selling now.  It's a card that goes in your laptop that allows you to connect to their wireless broadband anywhere you can get a cell phone signal.  This will provide much greater coverage, but generally slower speeds.

First thing is first... did the paper rip? There may be a small peice that is caught inside causing a jam. Second, is there a feed button? Might try this to see if it's the printer itself (which my guess is that it is). Third, usually when you turn a printer off and then back on depending on brand, there will be a test print, if this works, you know it isn't the printer. Fourth, unplug it for about 10 minutes and then plug it back in... sometimes it is the most simple things..lol. Fifth, if this doesn't work, uninstall the printer from your computer, reinstall. Don't have the disk? Don't worry! You can almost ALWAYS go to the website of the manufacturer and download the drivers for your particular model (same thing a disk would do). Hopefully one of these things work, and be safe on your travels back to wherever you live on Friday!!

"PCMCIA :- Personal Computer Memory Card International Association.\n\nPC card\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n(Redirected from PCMCIA)\nJump to: navigation, search\nPC cards are cards designed to be inserted into laptop computers in order to enable extra functions.\n\nThey were first called PCMCIA cards as the original standards were set by the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association. This awkward initialism was jokingly expanded as ""People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms"" or ""Personal Computer Manufacturers Can't Invent Acronyms"". A later revision of the PC card is known as CardBus. The PCMCIA is also developing a new notebook peripheral specification called Newcard or ExpressCard.\n\nThe first PC cards (PCMCIA, with the more logical IBM meaning: Peripheral Component Microchannel Interconnect Architecture) were Type I, and supported actual Memory Cards (e.g. ATA Type I Flash Memory Cards), such as DRAM or flash memories. Type II cards added I/O support in addition to memory applications, and type III expanded on this. The interface's role as I/O for various devices has largely superseded its role as a Memory Card, but this role did spawn a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of ATA Type I cards (CompactFlash, MiniCard, and SSFDC(Smartmedia)).\n\n \nType II and III PC Cards. The Type III is twice the thickness of the Type II.Contents [hide]\n1 PC card \n2 CardBus \n3 ExpressCard (Newcard) \n4 External links \n5 See also \n \n\n\n[edit]\nPC card\nA PC card is about the size of a credit card. There are three different sizes, varying in thickness: Type I is 3.3 mm thick, Type II is 5.0 mm thick and Type III is 10.5 mm thick. All are 85.6 mm long and 54.0 mm wide. Most notebooks used to come with two Type II slots or one Type III. With the removal of legacy ports, most notebooks now only come with one Type II card slot. Fortunately, most Type III cards were normally external hard disks that have since been replaced with USB, FireWire and now Serial ATA solutions, along with flash memory options. Memory cards such as ATA Type I flash memory cards continue to be available for the PC Card Type I.\n\nAs the original name suggests, the first PC cards were for memory expansion. However, the existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to all manner of devices being made available in this form. Typical devices include network cards, modems and hard disks.\n\nThe electrical specification for the PC card is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter need only be a socket adapter.\n\nThe form factor is also used by the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts.\n\n[edit]\nCardBus\nThe original PC Card bus was 16-bit, similar to ISA. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus, in the same physical form as the earlier cards. The notch on the left hand front of the card is slightly shallower on a CardBus card so a 32-bit card cannot be plugged into a slot that can only accept 16-bit cards. Most new slots are compatible with both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices.\n\nCardBus includes the bus mastering ability, which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU. Many chipsets are available for both PCI and CardBus cards, such as those that support Wi-Fi.\n\n[edit]\nExpressCard (Newcard)\n \nExpressCards compared to the predecessor PCCard.The PCMCIA has developed a replacement for the present CardBus standard, called ExpressCard (originally codenamed Newcard), which is claimed to be faster and less complex than CardBus. The host device supports both PCI Express and USB 2.0 connectivity through the ExpressCard slot, and each card uses whichever the designer feels most appropriate to the task. The cards are hot-pluggable.\n\nExpressCard supports two form factors, ExpressCard/34 (34 mm wide) and Expre"
I do know that it causes eye strain.  I hear many people say that they wear glasses now because they have worked with computers for so long but, if the computers were the cause I don't know.

It used to be with old hard drives you had to park the heads before you moved the computer.  With the newest models of hard drives, they automatically park every time power is disconnected.  So now you just have to make sure all the cables are disconnected, and everything is packed securely without a lot of rattling.

I've had this problem with my laptop as well. I tried looking for every problem I could think of--viruses, malfunctioning updates, spyware, or overheating. I'd suggest looking for all of these culprits first. In my case, none of these problems were responsible for my computers flaky performance, so I decided to format my hard drive and install a fresh copy of XP--now my computer works like a charm:)

You can only inherit from a single class.  You can implement at many different interfaces into a class as you want/need.  Interfaces allow unlike classes to bahave the same way.

"Mac OS X 10.4.5 (""Tiger""). I have an iMac G5. It's definitely a lot better than a PC, it has built-in wireless LAN (AirPort), bluetooth, and speakers. It's also a monitor and computer in one box instead of a monitor plus a big box.\n\nG5's are definitely faster than Celeron 1.8 GHz machines, which I previously had. Since many of the computer manufacturers still sell Celerons as low-end computers, I just figured I would let you know."
Choosing interfaces and abstract classes is not an either/or proposition. If you need to change your design, make it an interface. However, you may have abstract classes that provide some default behavior. Abstract classes are excellent candidates inside of application frameworks.\n\nAbstract classes let you define some behaviors; they force your subclasses to provide others. For example, if you have an application framework, an abstract class may provide default services such as event and message handling. Those services allow your application to plug in to your application framework. However, there is some application-specific functionality that only your application can perform. Such functionality might include startup and shutdown tasks, which are often application-dependent. So instead of trying to define that behavior itself, the abstract base class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods. The base class knows that it needs those methods, but an abstract class lets your class admit that it doesn't know how to perform those actions; it only knows that it must initiate the actions. When it is time to start up, the abstract class can call the startup method. When the base class calls this method, Java calls the method defined by the child class.\n\nMany developers forget that a class that defines an abstract method can call that method as well. Abstract classes are an excellent way to create planned inheritance hierarchies. They're also a good choice for nonleaf classes in class hierarchies.

Checkmate (frequently shortened to mate) is a situation in chess (and in other boardgames of the chaturanga family) in which one player's king is under attack and there is no way to meet that threat; it is a check from which there is no escape. The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways).

I assume you are talking about Windows XP SP2. It is so much better than service pack 1 because it includes so many more security and performance fixes than sp1. It takes up so much space because it is a lot of fixes, has some new features, and it has an uninstaller. Yes, you can roll back to SP1, so it needs a lot of backup files. Don't ask me why, I don't get it.\nThe new features are Win XP yelling at you if you don't have Firewall or Antivirus software, or if it is off or outdated. Also, it has a lame firewall. Still better than nothing though.

Ok... to say that it's twists per foot is, although technically accurate, a pretty lame answer.\nThere are three standards to speak of: CAT 5, CAT 5e, and CAT 6.\nTrue CAT 5 runs at 100 Mbit/s.\nCAT 5e is capable of 1000 Mbit/s (gigabit).\nCAT 6 is capable of 1000 Mbit/s (same as CAT 5e) but the difference is that due to the tighter twisting CAT 6 provides much less noise and therefor significantly reduces error correction - especially over longer distances.\nIn terms of a patch cable CAT 6 will realize a 10 X increase in speed over CAT 5 - but essentially no increase in speed versus a CAT 5e.\nIn terms of straight-through cabling CAT 6 will realize a 10 X increase in speed versus CAT 5 cabling. CAT 6 will also realize a slight increase in speed compared to CAT 5e over longer distances due to limited line noise. Over shorter distances in a straight-through situation the difference between CAT 5e and CAT 6 is negligible.\nThe trick to wiring CAT 6 is to never strip more than one inch of shielding when terminating the wire. Stripping (unpairing) more than an inch will decrease network quality.

For a test, copy a few of the files to a new folder, open a command prompt window, and CD to that folder. \nOpen a text editor and type or copy/paste the following: \n@echo off\nif ""%1""=="""" goto main\nren ""%1 %2"" %2\ngoto  exit\n:main\nfor %%i in (""?? *.mp3"") do call %0 %%i \n:exit\n\nNote there is a space between (""?? and *.mp3"").\nSave the text as temp.bat in the new folder.\nIn the command prompt window, type ""temp.bat"" (no quotes) and hit enter.\nThis should rename any file in that folder whose name begins with 2 characters and a space; the new name should be the same with the initial two characters and space removed.\nIf this works you can CD to the folder containing all the files to be renamed, copy temp.bat to that folder and repeat the execution of temp.bat."

"AC3 is normally a audio codec, primarily used in video files to encode the audio.   A direct quote from PCMag:\n\nDefinition of: AC-3 \n\n(Active Coding-3) Dolby's third digital audio coding technology based on a perceptual coding method. It is more advanced than AC-2 and provides six channels of audio in less space than two-channel stereo CD. AC-3 and ""Dolby Digital"" are synonymous. See Dolby Digital. \n\nThe control panel object should be a graphical front end to which ever AC3-decoder or encoder codec that's installed on your computer.  This control panel object should allow you to change various options associated with how AC3 works.\n\nDivx is a popular video compression that can utilize AC3 sound streams.  There are many other popular products that either use the AC3 decoder, or possibly even allow you to encode your sound files into the AC3 standard.  Creative Labs has such products.\n\nThe control panel object normally shows up when you install a product that uses one of the open-source AC3 decoders.  There may be commericial software that will install this object as well, of course.\n\nHope this helps a little."

XML is important because it allows you to persist data in an application independent way.  This is huge.  It gives you the flexability to use the same document across multiple platforms and systems.  If company A generates some data, but that data now needs to be shared with company B, as long as company A stores that data acording to the rules of XML company B can easily process the data generated from company A.....\n\nHopefully that makes sense and gives you an idead of why XML is important.

The Intel Pentium D on the other hand is composed of two 32-bit cores with a bridge to act as a 64-bit processor.

Bad idea.  XP is not a mac interface.  There are differences between a single and double clicks function.  Better for you to get used to it.\n\nThat said it sort of depends on what mouse you are using as to whether it allows for changing left click to be double click.

"It's easier than you might think.  Windows has a built in sound recorder that will do the job.  You do need to get an adapter that will convert the audio output from your tape deck (RCA style plugs) to a 1/8"" stereo jack.  you should be able to go to Radio Shack and get this for a few dollars.  You then directly connect the audio out on your tape deck or stereo to the line in jack on the back of your computer.  Open Windows sound recorder.  Push play on your tape deck and record on you computer.  If you want to break up the tracks, you'll need to stop the tape and the recorder between songs.  I think an easier way is to record it as one big file.  Then use a sound editing program like Sony Sound Forge to chop it up.  Also note that the Windows sound recorder save audio as a *.wav file which is very large compared with *.mp3.  You'll want to have plenty of hard drive space available if you do many of these tapes.  A good sound editing program should be able to do the conversion for you.\n\nGood luck\n\nJason"

In VB.Net it is easy enough - there's a huge namespace devoted to fonts, that lets you bring in fonts temporarily. I think because of the callbacks, needed, etc. That is probably how you'd want to work.\n\nDo a .NET dll - create a method that working with System.Drawing.Fonts brings in your font temporarily. Then put your DLL in the Gac and register it in COM. Call your .NET DLL from VB6.\n\nYour other option - and it might work - is on your VB6 app's form load event, copy the TTF file for the Arabic font into c:&#92;windows&#92;system&#92;fonts - a little less robust since you kind of have to hope you have permissions to do so, but most times it will work...

Mac OS X is such a stable OS for one. Compare it to WinXP and there are dozens of good things. First of all Apple computers do not have DOS. No applications use other applications to work well on Macs. If you want to delete a program on a Mac, you just delete it. No worry about it taking a part of another program with it. Each application is a stand alone program. Usually, DOS is the base for viruses, worms etc. Since Macs have no DOS, they don't get any of the viruses that PC's do. You don't need spyware; anti virus; tracking bug software to keep your computer safe and clean. It comes to you that way and it stays that way.\n Most Mac applications are extremely simple to use, even for the first time user. The stability of the Apple Computers is solid. Plus they are sure a lot of fun to operate. It's very hard to compare OS X 10.4 to MS XP as they are as different as apples and oranges. They both are computers and that is where the similaries end.

you will need to do as the above poster indicates, and share your printer.  The share NAME should not be more than 8 characters.  Also everyone who needs it, will need to create a user account on your machine....if that is alot of people, then you may consider activating the 'guest' account, though it IS a security risk to do so.\n\nthey will also all need the printer drivers installed, once they can detect it.\n\nIf *YOU* do not have problems accessing any other resources on the network, then your trasport protocol is ok. If you can't access other network resources, then you need to make sure you have the 'client Service for Netware' installed\nstart--control panel--network connections--right-click on the 'local area connection' and choose properties, look in the box for the Netware protocols IPX/SPX, and make sure they are checked....if not there, click the 'install' button and then click the 'add' button ('client' is the default so you don't have to select it,) choose the Netware Service client, and OK. choose 'ok' for all but the Properties window, (it changes the 'ok' button to 'close',)\npress 'close' there.  you should re-boot at this point....TWICE.\n\n\nIf you have the Windows firewall on, you need to open the control in the control panel, and click the 'exceptions' tab, and ensure that the 'file and printer sharing' box is checked.\n\nHope this helps !

"Good question!  And one we could ask about any large software app.  I think the question to ask yourself when looking for this answer is, ""What is in greater supply?  Money or the talent to build and support the application?""  For example: if you're flush with cash and have little available talent (don't have the right skill sets or the right skill sets are busily doing other things), then a purchase is the best option.\n\nIf cash is in short supply and you have idle talent, then a system developed in-house may be a good option.  Keep in mind the in-house development doesn't end after deployment.  Someone will need to maintain the application over time.  This is, IMHO, the biggest failure of most in-house implementations - an organization forgets to allocate cycles/money for this.\n\nAnother reason to build your own may be your own processes.  If there's no prepackaged system capable of conforming to your processes and the business is unwilling to change for the system, then you may have to develop your own.\n\nA CMDB is a huge undertaking.  I'm not familiar with the talent you have available, but I would shudder to think how complex of an undertaking it would be to roll your own.  I would compare it, in scope, to a financial system and I would always buy in that instance.\n\nDave"

When dealing with personal computers, other than the manufacturers label on the front of the machine that may have the date the hardware was assembled at the factory, there are no hidden locations containing a date that Windows 98 or Windows XP was loaded or when a hard drive may have been changed.\n\nThere are entries in the registry that contain the date that the operating system, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows XP, etc.) was installed, but their integrity is not guaranteed because a correct date is not required for the machine to run; you can change the date and nothing will happen.  The same is true for a file as well.  You can very easily find programs that will let you change the date on a file; creation, last accessed or changed.  You can change some settings so that the last accessed date is not tracked.  You can back up a file and use the current date when you restore it.\n\nThere is no easy way to tell when someone was on your machine, especially if there is no password required when you log in or if you leave your machine on all the time.\n\nI could be way off so if you could tell us what you are trying to do, maybe we could give you another road to try.

Complicated question.\nThere are many different kinds of boot disks and boot cd's available on the internet.  If you have the know how, you can even make your own.\nThe process of making a bootable cd from a floppy disk is not as straightforward as it might sound.  You have to use cd-burning software (roxio or nero are 2 examples) that support burning bootable cd's.  You then tell the program to use floppy boot emulation, and provide the bootable floppy disk, The software will read the disk, then copy it to to boot sector of the cd.  Just copying the files doesn't work.\n\nDo you have the windows disk that came with the computer?  It is bootable and will allow you to re-install you OS. This seems like the obvious answer since you'll need it anyway.\n\nIf you simply want to boot from a cd to browse hard drive contents, there are several options, but most involve expensive software.  Norton Ghost 9 is bootable and will allow you browse your hard drive. Vcom system suite has a similar function as does Winternals ERD Commander.

"Because the product keys are encrypted, you cannot simply go into the registry and retrieve it like you could in earlier versions of Windows. You will need a utility program to extract the product id from your registry. One such tool is the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder. Another is the Belarc Advisor. I am certain there are others on the market as well but we will focus on the use of these two for the purposes of this article.\n\n    * The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is a freeware utility that retrieves your Product Key (CD key) used to install Windows or Office from your registry. It has the options to copy the key to clipboard, save it to a text file, or print it for safekeeping. It works on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Office 97 and Office XP. Unfortunately, it does not appear to support Office 2000.\n\n      The Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder is amazingly simple to use. The file itself, keyfinder.exe, is small—only 257 KB. There is no installation program. Just run the program, either from the command line or by double-clicking it from the folder you downloaded it to. When you do, your product key will appear as shown. (I changed my product key in this image for security reasons.)\n    * The Belarc Advisor is a freeware utility that builds a detailed profile of your installed software and hardware and then displays the results in your Web browser. None of this information is sent to the internet. It is all stored privately on your computer.\n\n      The information displayed includes, but is not limited to:\n         1. Operating System type and build\n         2. Motherboard brand and serial number\n         3. Installed drives, CD and fixed, including brand and capacity\n         4. Installed Microsoft hotfixes\n         5. Installed Microsoft software licenses and some keys\n         6. List of all installed software \n\nNOTE: It should be noted that I have received at least one report of the Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder returning an incorrect key. I have never had that happen to me and I have used it many time to recover keys from the registries of clients computers. The Belarc Advisor does have this footnote on its results page regarding Windows keys: ""This may be the manufacturer's factory installed product key rather than yours."" I believe this may be the cause of the MJB error as well.\n\nThat’s all there is to it. Once you recover the key, write down the number and then you can reinstall your software, or place the it in a database where you won’t lose it.\n\nEDIT: 10:38AM, March 10, 2006\n\nYou may want to try Insaneware Keyfinder:\n\nhttp://www.insaneware.com/"

There is only one difference between the new pc's that run os x and the ones that don't. A chip that has some information for loading the os. I downloaded a beta version of os x for x86 processors a while before they put in the drivers for that chip and it worked great on my system. All I had to do was install it like I would on a mac.\nA later beta of os x for x86 had drivers for the chip, and all you had to do was delete them and it worked.\nAll you need to install it is the cd and those drivers taken off. But in the release version they will make it a little harder because they will try to integrate those drivers throughout the system software, but people will get around it pretty quick probably.\nI have tried it on intel and amd systems and it worked. It is compatible with most hardware and you can use linux drivers with some hardware without too much trouble. But if you like moc os x, you probably have a strong aversion to terminals because of the old marketing put out by apple and microsoft.

That said, do not visit unknown websites, open suspicious emails and attachments, or click on links that you don’t know what it’s for.  Also, always keep your anti-spyware and antivirus programs on.  These simple guidelines will save you from hours of headaches with pop-up ads and computer slow down.  Good luck and have a nice day!

No such animal as Yahoo Hotmail.. what you are interested in is the differences between Yahoo Mail and Microsoft Hotmail. They are both web browser based email clients. Yahoo lets you store more data (messages) but other than that there really is no difference. Googles Gmail gives you the most space and it can be accessed both via the web and via pop3 (downloaded to your computer) without cost to you.. Hotmail and Yahoo offer pop access for a fee.
I'm in MO also and know the college. Why can't you go to college? My friend is totally paralized from the neck down and he had help and finished college.

You would also qualify for grants and everything.
"Unfortunately, the Windows Service pack 2 has a bug (!) You should feel angered at MicroSoft for this (I know I was.) \n\nFor a simpler way to have the network up and running than using the cmd (Which didn't work for me), go to the website listed below and download the patch to address and fix the problem.\n\n\nIf the patch didn't work (and for me, it didn't) then you have no other option but to uninstall ""Windows Service Pack 2"" from the Add/Remove programs menu in control panel. Now the network works!\n\n(I am not responsible for any inconvienence caused though!)"

For spyware solutions, Spybot Search & Destroy works very well.  If you are willing to try Microsoft's beta, you can also consider defender.  Both are currently free.\n\nhttp://www.safer-networking.org\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=435bfce7-da2b-4a6a-afa4-f7f14e605a0d&DisplayLang=en\n\nAlways remember that an ounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure.  That said, do not visit unknown websites, open suspicious emails and attachments, or click on links that you don’t know what it’s for.  Also, always keep your anti-spyware and antivirus programs on.  These simple guidelines will save you from hours of headaches with pop-up ads and computer slow down.  Good luck and have a nice day!

Don't delete ANY hidden files; they are almost always hidden for a reason (needed for programs or operating system). \n\nIf you don't want to buy a new computer you can buy a new hard drive if you need more space, which you do (you can probably find a new 40 GB for $20 if you try). Having that little space left can significantly slow down your computer.\n\nBut I have to say it, buy a newer computer. ; )\n\nSeriously, I bought a computer at an auction (silent, not eBay) about a year ago that was at LEAST 10 times better than that (Pentium III, 128 RAM, 12 GB hard drive, CD-RW drive, monitor / keyboard / speakers), for only $16.67.
Because of the register limits.\n\nLet's say the register can contain 16 bits of information. That would be enough to address 2^16 = 65,536 locations.\n\nNot enough. So the hard disk is divided into chunks of 65,536 bytes.\n\nA 4 gig hard disk would need:\n\n1 gig = 2^30\n4 gigs = 4 x 2^30 divided by 2^16 = 4 x 2^14 = 2^16\n\nExactly the width in bits of a second registers.\n\nSo to address a specific byte in this 4 gigs hard disk, you need first to know in which chunk it is (first register = segment pointer) and second you need to know which of the bytes in that register interests us (second register = offset pointer).\n\nModern disks use an extra virtual register (half of a third register) to spand the number of addresses up to 2^8 x 2^16 x 2^16 = 2^10 x 2^30 = 1024 gigabytes.\n\nSome big computers have 32-bit width registers, which means only one register would be needed to find any offset address in a whole 4 gig HD.

Hi,\n  RFCs are internet standards developed for the internet community. These standards have to be followed if you are building a software/protocol which has to work along with the internet. MIB or Management Information Base is a component of Network Management suites. Simple Network Management Protocol deals with this. Refer to RFC1089 for the same. In short, RFC's are documents and specifications. MIB has one such RFC.

That refers to the operation mode of the memory. \n\nThere are two modes, single-channel and dual-channel.\n\nWhat this means is how the computer access the memory to retreive information, if the Main Board only has single-channel operation, then the data of the memory only can be accessed sequentialy no matter how many memory chips you have.\n\nWhen the operation is double-channel, then the memory slots on the main board has two different colors, one for channel A and one for channel B. This allows the computer to access two differents memory locations at one time, of course, if you have at least one chip on channel A and one chip en channel B.\n\nFor more information see the reference:

your cart will dry out if stored in a warm/dry environment, such as by a heater.  your best bet is to check the expiration date on the bottom of the package, most of the carts have dates on or around the bottom of the box.\n\nmost of the time you should be able to get a few hundred of pages out of your cartridge.  it depends on the coverage. IE if you are printing entire blocks of black ink, then you will use much more ink than if you are only printing a few lines of text.\n\ni would get a new cart, and do a physical page count if you have to to see if it happens again.  if it does, you might want to contact lexmark and find out what they recommend.

Speed is usually measured in BAUD or BITS..more commonly measured in BITS. Functonality depends on what you are talking about..are you talking about hard disk I/O or RAM or Bus ?  Importance...well compatability issues arise or perhaps memory or disk speeds that are too slow will create traffic jams and lock up your system.\n\nBasically, the speed or I/O measures the ability of a device to read and write data.
Cyber Sitter is probably the best. It is sends you an e-mail everytime your child goes on somethine suspicious. It also takes pictures and records EVERY website your child's been on. You can also use it to restrict internet access at certain times of the day, and you can also restrict your child from using IM services. Unless your child is known for computer hacking (highly unlikeable) it is nearly impossible for your child to figure out how to disable Cyber Sitter.
you need to have an internet connection to see them.  when you have pictures pasted to an email they are being shown from the website they are hosted at.  If you don't have an internet connection at the time you are looking at the email, the images won't show up.  \n\nConnect to the internet and then refresh the email and they should work as long as they are still on the hosting server where they were copied from

web programming is about the most benign thing you can do on a computer (although you may consider dual monitors), as for some of the other things, especially mySQL etc with large databases, ram is good - more is better. For web serving a pIII dual 1GHz box would work just fine, so just about anything you can find out there today will be satisfactory. Depending on the web-server configuration and the number of hits you're getting, multi threading will really pay off though, so look for dual core if you're hosting a really really popular site. Never worked with Oracle, so I can't speak to that one..\n\nWhen you're building a computer, if you want to minimize latency especially on first loads, you'll want a faster hard drive (say a raptor) 10k and 15k rpm drives have lower latencies and can stream data faster. Having more ram (depending on the os) will allow for more data to stay in ram, reducing the number of trips to the hard drive (your biggest data bottleneck on a modern pc).\n\nFor just about any home use, your canned amd64 3500+, 1GB of ram, 7200 rpm 300GB hard drive, geforce 6600gt, 16x dvd drive, and 300-400watt power supply will work just fine.\n\nIf you want cutting edge, amd64 X2 4400+, 2GB low latency (e.g. corsair xms or kingston hyperX) ram, 10k rpm raptors (or 15krpm scsi, but you'll have to get a card and possibly 80-60 pin converter), and a 7800GTX or X1800/1900.\n\nIMO unless you're doing predominantly video work, stay away from intel for now, they're too hot and for just about everything else, you'll get better performance out of an amd64.
You seem to have way too much running on your system at once. Here are some pointers:\n\n- Shut System Restore off -\nIf you have a virus or adware on your system sometimes it gets put into system restore. This will need shut off till you go through my instructions. No since removing it then system restore putting it back in.\nRight click My Computer->Click Properties Click the System Restore Tab then Check Turn off System Restore. Click Ok. This will take a bit but give it time.\n\n- Remove stuff from your startup -\nGoto Start -> Run, type in msconfig then ok. Click the startup tab. Here you will see many things starting up on your system. Many of them icons down by your time are located in this program. The only things that need to be enabled here are anti-virus programs and any system security. Any printer, graphics, messengers, download programs (bearshare and others) do not need to be here. Uncheck everything you do not need, click ok, and you will be asked to reboot. You can here. This does not remove the software from your system, but makes it so you have to start it yourself.  No since having ICQ or what ever startup when you turn your computer on.  Note if you dont know what the thing is or what program it is linked to you can either google it or leave it alone.\n\n- Run spyware/adware remover -\nDownload and install Adaware. On install do the update and full system scan. Once done remove all Critical Objects.\n\nDownload and install Spybot Search and Destroy. Run this and do a complete update on everything. Do a system scan and remove everything found.\n\n- Update windows from http://windowsupdate.microsoft... be sure to download all High Priority.\n\n- Update your virus scanner and do a virus scan.\n\n- Go into Internet Explorer click Tools->Internet Options\nOnce here click settings. Delete cookies, delete files, Lower the disk space to 10 or so. This is the space allowed for internet files to be cached on your system. Nobody needs 10% of their storage allocated to it. Click Ok\n\n- Remove uneeded programs\nClick Control Panel->Add Remove Programs. Here you can remove what you dont need.\n\n- Defrag your system\nClick Start->All Programs->Accessories->System Tools->Disk Defragmenter. Once here tell it to defrag and it will take some time.\n\n\nYou can, if you like, turn system restore back on by folling the directions above and unchecking that box. I myself never have it on and as a systems administrator of 1400 systems and servers we never have it on at our place of business. because it caches virusus and adware quite a bit.

I've had problems with avg in the past, and found that avast also works quite well and is not nearly as bloated as some of the (not necessarily free) software out there. You have to put up with registering for the home edition but it's a free registration.\n\nAs far as firewalls go, I'd say don't even mess with it. Software firewalls are annoying and cumbersome, and very hard to find for free. If you really want a firewall, though I realize it's not free, buy a router (the nature of many-to-one nat or PAT used in most home routers makes them very secure) \n\nAlternatively, if you're feeling up to a challenge and have an old junked pc lying around that still runs check out smoothwall www.smoothwall.org free to download and install and a good learning experience

Two 256MB SDRAM DIMMs will outperform a single 512MB DIMM.  Each DIMM has a set number of banks, so more DIMMs means more banks.  Regardless of their size, spreading your memory out among multiple banks offers better performance because the CPU can be preparing to write to a different bank while writing to the current one.

Yeah ... its enough for home computer !
First off, Incredimail works like any other external e-mail program like Outlook Express, for example, in that you need an e-mail service that supports a 3rd party program to send and receive.  You have to configure your POP3 and STMP information along with your authentication.  Services such as Yahoo and Hotmail do not support this feature, therefore Incredimail won't work if you are using it for your Yahoo mail.\n\nIf you are trying to send and receive mail with a regular POP account, contact your e-mail provider and get the correct configuration information (this is usually available on their website).\n\nThe information you are looking for should be something like this...\n\nAccount:\nPassword:\nIncoming mail POP3 settings:\nOutgoing mail SMTP settings:\nMy server requires SMTP authentication:

Grid computing is an emerging computing model that provides the ability to perform higher throughput computing by taking advantage of many networked computers to model a virtual computer architecture that is able to distribute process execution across a parallel infrastructure. Grids use the resources of many separate computers connected by a network (usually the internet) to solve large-scale computation problems. Grids provide the ability to perform computations on large data sets, by breaking them down into many smaller ones, or provide the ability to perform many more computations at once than would be possible on a single computer, by modeling a parallel division of labour between processes.

"I'd like to ask you something. Why did you call yourself [swear word] stupid, mentally deranged and retarded? You made four mistakes in your three sentences!\n\n1) You put a comma before ""and"" in the actual question. You only use a comma before a conjunction (and, but, or, nor) when it is a compound sentence. You question is not a compound sentence because you could not say ""Why are people on the internet so [swear word] stupid? Unable to use proper grammar? It doesn't work. To use a comma before and, you must say ""Why are people so [swear word] stupid, and why are they unable to use proper grammar.\n\n2) You made a second mistake in your details. You did not put a comma after ""Seriously."" You need a comma there because it is a parenthetical expression. Basically, you could say ""Are you all mentally degranged [mispelled as it was in question] or something makes no change to the meaning of the sentence.\n\n3) Finally, you misspelled ""deranged"" (Yes, spelling is part of grammar!). You spelled it degranged, which is not a word in the English language. Even if it were correct in a foreign language, it would still be improper grammar because you cannot mix two languages in one sentence unless it is for demonstrative purposes.\n\n4) You were redundant with the use of mentally and deranged. There is only one way to be deranged, and that is mentally. You should have just said ""deranged""!\n\nIn response to your question, people are apparently unable to use grammar because they do exactly the same thing you do. They don't memorize their grammar rules, don't spell check, and don't care! They are too lazy! You can't criticise, because you do it yourself.\n\nNOTE: I have read this three (3) times, and it looks like good grammar to me. Even if I made a mistake, at least I tried to proof-read it!\n\nNOTE: If a sentence/word in quotes is misspelled/has bad grammar, it is because I was mimicking the way you spelled it in your question. I removed swear words and replaced them with [swear word].\n\nNOTE: Three-quarters of the people who answered your question have bad grammar! It illustrates my point perfectly!"

There's a lot of ways, I'm sure you'll get alot of answers, so here are a few:\n\n1) External USB hard drive\n-- this is the easiest way, IMHO.  All you do is plug it into the wall, plug it into the USB port, and you are done!  You can get an 80GB drive for less than $100.  Also, you can easily bring your HD to another computer, at work for instance.  The downside is transfer rates.  If you have a old computer, it might only support USB1.0, which will be slower than 2.0 (USB2.0 devices will work with USB1.0, but data transfer will be slower).  USB1.0 is fine for reading MP3's, but it will be a little slow when transfering large amounts of data back and forth.  (Looking at the specs on DELL, it looks like your computer has USB2.0).\n\nHere are some USB hard drives:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=br_ss_hs/104-6257906-0810344?search-alias=aps&keywords=external%20USB%20hard%20drive\n\n2) Internal Harddrive\n-- Looks like you have a notebook.  This is rather more complex, you have to buy a HD with more capacity than your existing HD, transfer your contents over using another computer, then install the new HD.  I wouldn't go this route.\n\n3) Network Attached Storage (NAS)\n\nA little more complex and expensive than external USB.  The benefits is you can mount this to your home/work network, and any computer on the network can access it.  However, this means you have to have a network at home, typically with some sore of DHCP server (most home routers).  Networking setup takes more time than setting up the USB.  The cheaper NAS devices I have seen, from Netgear for instance, have poorer user reviews than the simpler USB drives.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009RML8S/sr=8-1/qid=1142849285/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6257906-0810344?%5Fencoding=UTF8\n\nHope that helps, I'm sure you'll get more options from other users.

"Hi Doc...\n\nWell, if you followed the steps I gave you last time you asked this, then the problem is probably hardware-related. To find out for sure, get a voltmeter, set it to DC volts. \nThe USB interface consists of 4 pins. The two outside pins supply power to the device, and the inside pins are for data. Polarity need not be observed if you are using a digital voltmeter. With the computer booted up and running in Windows, put one lead of the voltmeter on one outside pin of a USB port, and the other lead on the other outside pin. If the meter reads 5 volts (regardless of polarity), then the USB ports are getting power, and the USB hub has probably failed. This problem is a depot-level problem, and only a warranty replacement or costly service will fix it. However... If the voltmeter reads zero, then your 5volt power connector inside the laptop case has probably disconnected. If the machine is within warranty, by all means take advantage. If not, then disassembly will be required. If your next Yahoo Question is ""How do you take apart a Dell Laptop"" then I will assume that your USB ports failed the voltage check, and I'll go into the disassembly procedures there."
Not sure but try unplugging it, taking the battery out and try to turn it on.

"MySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\n\nMySQL is a relational database management system, which means it stores data in separate tables rather than putting all the data in one big area. This adds flexibility, as well as speed. The SQL part of MySQL stands for ""Structured Query Language,"" which is the most common language used to access databases. The MySQL database server is the most popular open source database in the world. It is extremely fast and easy to customize, due to its architecture. Extensive reuse of code within the software, along with a minimalist approach to producing features with lots of functionality, gives MySQL unmatched speed, compactness, stability, and ease of deployment. Their unique separation of the core server from the storage engine makes it possible to run with very strict control, or with ultra fast disk access, whichever is more appropriate for the situation."
I am actually a photographer and i keep my pics on flickr. There is a setting on it that you can choose to make your pics either private or public.

I also have started transferring my baby pics over there too for safe keeping. i can honestly say i never had a problem with flickr

Hi MuslimSoldier4Life...\n\nI am not quite sure of what you really mean, but if you are speaking of having an email address and want to change one letter or so in to something else without having to go through the entire process of creating a new email...then the answer is simply NO...\n\nThis is because the letter you want to change in your email may match an email that already exists...\n\nAlso, changing a letter means changing the email address...when people send you emails after you change the letter, all these mails won't be delivered to you, but to the old account that you changed...thats why its not possible to change letters in your existing emails account...

"LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a software protocol for enabling anyone to locate organizations, individuals, and other resources such as files and devices in a network, whether on the public Internet or on a corporate intranet. LDAP is a ""lightweight"" (smaller amount of code) version of Directory Access Protocol (DAP), which is part of X.500, a standard for directory services in a network. LDAP is lighter because in its initial version it did not include security features. LDAP originated at the University of Michigan and has been endorsed by at least 40 companies. Netscape includes it in its latest Communicator suite of products. Microsoft includes it as part of what it calls Active Directory in a number of products including Outlook Express. Novell's NetWare Directory Services interoperates with LDAP. Cisco also supports it in its networking products. \nIn a network, a directory tells you where in the network something is located. On TCP/IP networks (including the Internet), the domain name system (DNS) is the directory system used to relate the domain name to a specific network address (a unique location on the network). However, you may not know the domain name. LDAP allows you to search for an individual without knowing where they're located (although additional information will help with the search)."

If your guestbook was written by you then include a check to see where the user is coming from (check the IP) and disable the guestbook for people coming from that address.\n\nIf your guestbook is not written by you, the only course you have is to complain to his ISP which can be found by tracing his IP address, but you need to know what it is.\nGo to http://www.dnsstuff.com/ and enter the IP numbers to find out the company to contact.

Many Routers do not require a 'username', just a password.  \n\nIf you changed it from the default, then you will have to find it, or performe a 'Reset', (not just unplugging the power,) to return all the Router settings to the Factory defaults.  This means the Router will need to be programmed as it was before, in order for it to work again.  \n\nOnce you have 'reset' it, then the documentation that came with it, should have the default password.  \n\nthere are websites that have the defaults listed if you know the model # of your Router.  here is the one I use:\n\nhttp://www.phenoelit.de/dpl/dpl.html"

You don't need to connect a CD player to your computer if it already has a CD burner in it.  The burner will also be the reader.\n\nI suggest you download itunes, set it up to create mp3 files, and load your CD's into it.  I did an entire collection of about 400 CDs in my spare time...\n\nOnce you get all that done, you can just drop and drag the files from their respective itunes folder onto you CD drive (with a blank CD-R in it) and Windows will ask you if you want to make a CD (say NO!) or a data disk (say YES!)\n\nYou'll be able to store about 10 times the amount of music this way.   \n\nIMPORTANT:  Make sure you set itunes to create MP3 files!!!  Itunes defaults to its own format, which will be useless to you in anything other than an ipod or playing through itunes.  MP3 is the way to go for compatability with ALL devices.

Usually, the picture has to be hosted elsewhere on the internet. You can place the URL/web address of the image between [img] and [/img] tags to get the image to show up.\n\nIf you do not know the web address of an image that is on the web, go to that image and right-click on it. Then view Properites. There you will see the URL which you can copy and paste into your message. An example would look like this:\n\n[url]http:// www.mysite.com/pic.jpg[/url]\n\nMany forums also offer the option of uploading a picture if it is not already on the web. Check to see if there is an option somewhere near the text box to add pictures. If not, you can also try uploading your photo to a site such as http://www.photobucket.com/ that will host your picture for free and give you the URL to access it.

An easy way could be to write a windows batch file. Basically you need to know how to write a little DOS. You give it a destination folder and a keyword for deleting all files inside the folder. Or delete the whole folder and  then re-create it, but it might be risky. I forget how but it's easy to find instructions and writing the file. Then you can put this little file inside one of the windows folders for repeating tasks. Sorry to be so vague. It's absolutely possible and not that difficult, I just don't remember the exact details.\nAlso you can use freeware but beware of spyware.

yes you can. depending on your stereo. if your stereo has audio jack holes, one white and one red, you can purchase an adapter at radio shack that has 2 female audio jack holes on one end, and on the other end has a headphone plug, and simply plug it into your PCs speaker jack. i have the same thing hooked up at my house. i don't know if some sound cards have built in red and white audio jacks but you can try and look to see if there are some out there. also if your sound card or any other kind (I'm not sure) has a fiber optic digital line in, and your stereo has one, then you can do it that way. hope that helps, if you need i can send you a pic of what the connector looks like.

"Yahoo search is better from my side. Though i frequently use www.google.co.in, because of my firefox plugin(aggregate google and yahoo results), which aggregates the results to be obtained from google as well as yahoo in a single page. \nI do it because i need to get more search results to avoid the mistakes of missing relavant research content.\nYou can install this firefox extension to have the better search results in a single shot. http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/extensions/aggregate_yahoo_and_google/aggregate_yahoo_and_google-1.0+-fx+fl.xpi\nwhen ever i compare the results, some times its unbelievable that yahoo is more relevant to what we are thinking off. \nI mean for the keywords that are ambiguous, or related to more than one particular field, the first page results are always to the context in what we are searching for. For ex: if i type ""document"" as a search keyword in the context of knowing what a document is how it constitutes, its genreal structure, etc; google will get some irrelavent results in the first page itself, but the yahoo results are almost perfect to the context what i am searching for.\nI came to know that yahoo searching is based on artificial intellegence. You can browse to the site http://mindset.research.yahoo.com in which the search results are divided into ranges of academic and business interest and depending on the range selection results will differ.\n\nBut only problem with yahoo is its search interface is not so attractive as google is. and moreover google is faster than yahoo sometimes."
"Howdy, I used to play runescape quite a bit, I'de be more than glad to give you a hand.\n\n(I answered this question @ http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Alg0YK0hbWc5jXvi1QmpQHcjzKIX?qid=1005121002088 Earlier)\n\nI do know quite a bit about runescape cheating.. (I don't play anymore, so it's really not worth it to ask me much) but one thing you should do is head on over to the message board at http://www.kaitnieks.com. Probably the biggest cheating forum around for runescape; they have modified, deobfuscated versions of the clients, and scripts.\n\nFirstly, cheating on RuneScape will not have the police coming to your door.  But, jagex has the right to close and ban your account if you do get caught.\n\nWhen it comes to anything relating to ""stat changers"" ""item makers"" and the like, all of them are fake.  They are programs design to in some way steal your username and password in RuneScape.  (They will do this by asking for your username and password.  They will either 1. keylog it 2. have you mail it to them 3. make you send it via a web form) Take this as a warning, Jagex will not give you your items back if you get scammed this way, and yes, it's VERY common.  Jagex has little sympathy because this simply happens SO much.\n\nAlso, when it comes to ""auto-fighters"" ""auto-miners"" and the like, any program designed to do this cannot be trusted.  Even if the cheat is a real working cheat, it's FAR to risky.  There are chances the file is binded with an undetectable keylogger, so you can open the file, use the cheat, and be ""hacked"" without even knowing it.  Jagex has NO sympathy for this, you will not get your items back.  If jagex does catch you using a cheat, you will be banned, this is extremely easy for them to detect now because they are so used to it.  You again, will be banned with no chance of getting your account back.\n\nSo you want wealth and fame in the world of runescape?  I can still help you, right now.\n\nIn my own opinion, RuneScape is not 'intellectually' challenging -- Just time-consuming.  Your best bet it to work in one trade skill and specialize, just to make money, then ""play the market"". Buy low, sell high. You could end up buying and item for 100k, selling for 110k, and making 10k profit.\n\nIn the mean time, I can give you a link which will provide a handful of helpful tutorials to help you out.  This GameFAQs link should cover your beginner-to-advanced trade skills and combat skills.  (trade skills are how you make money in RuneScape).\n\nTrade skills, such as clafting, smithing, mining, fletching, etc. are the ways you can make money in RuneScape.  At the end of the day, items and money aren't the main part of runescape, ANYONE can easily die and lose everything.  Your main goal of upkeep is your character's skills (be it fighting or trade).\n\nhttp://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/online/game/562728.html"
Are you asking about the mechanics, or about the organization?  \n\nA lot of programs (e.g., Office) encourage you to put eveything in the same place, although you can set a different default directory for each program if you want (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc.)\n\nI think it makes much more sense to organize your files into directories (and sub-directories) that make sense to YOU.  So, perhaps PERSONAL and WORK at the top, or FINANCE, KIDS, HOUSEHOLD, POLITICS, or whatever makes sense.   The sub-directories within each major category, again, based on what makes sense.  If you find that your needs change, or your first guess was wrong, you can change it easily enough.\n\nOne suggestion I would make, especially for things you create (like documents, letters, presentations), is to KEEP EVERYTHING and give it as descriptive a title as possible.  You'll never know when you can come back in 2 years or 10 years and re-use it (even as a starting point for something new), or get value from being able to search for it, and having everything on your machine.   Disk space is too cheap to justify throwing things away.   I have files going back more than 20 years, and find it very valuable.

First, to answer the question:\n\nGo to your Yahoo Mail account and click on ‘Options’ (to the right, near the top). Under ‘Management’ click on ‘Mail Addresses’, then select the account you are having trouble with (there is probably only one) and select ‘Edit’. Enter your full email address in the box labeled ‘Reply to:’ under ‘Name and Email’ and select ‘Save’ (at the left).\n\n\nAdditional details (since my other answer):\n\nGlad I was able to help. You may want to leave the 'Reply to:' box blank; when someone replies to your email it will still automatically go to you (when you fill in the 'Reply to:' box all replies go to the address entered, but when it is left blank the recipient’s email handler defaults to reply to the sender), and there will be a slightly lessened chance that your emails will sometimes be mistaken for spam and accidentally blocked by some spam filters.

Are you looking for just a tuner card? \n\nI've got an ATI All in Wonder 9800 128mb. I'd go with the 256mb All in Wonder, though, it's less than what I paid for mine a year ago. Last time I looked at it on Newegg, it was $219.00, it may be a little lower now though, I looked at it about 4 months ago.\n\nIn the year that I've had it, it hasn't given me any trouble. I can only compare it to the Dazzle capture card that I had previously, but it's definately a better vid capture card, hands down. A friend of mine swears by Canopus, but between my ATI and his Canopus, I'd take my ATI. \n\nProcessor speed of course makes all the difference in the world with video. I'd recommend minimum of 1gb ram. \n\nHere's my specs in case you're interested. \n\nIntel P4 3.0ghz HT\nATI All in Wonder 128mb\n1gb Ram\n120GB 7200RPM Seagate HDD\n\nIt's nothing special, but it beats the 1ghz machine I started out on video with.\n\nI don't have any experience with MCE, but I'm sure MCE should suffice for entertainment.

"Most of the time, the employer has already seen your qualifications on your resume, so the interview is basically used for some of the following:\n\n1)  The interviewer can ask additional questions about your qualifications and job history.\n\n2)  The interviewer can get a feel for your personality, and if you would be a good ""fit"" for the business/company.  (i.e., you may seem difficult to work with)\n\n3)  Its also for you to ask questions about the company, to see if its a job your looking for, and if you feel that you would ""fit in"" with the company.\n\nThere really is no ""set content"", so its all dependant on what type of company it is.  An interview can be anything from an informal chat with the hiring manager, to being tested on your skills and qualifications.  But again, its mostly to take a look at your personality.

When you are going for a random number always remember that the computer does not generate truly random numbers. It simply uses an set structure to pick them. To make the number seem more random, just remember that the odds of selecting the random number at the same time is virutally impossible. Therefore for truly random numbers try this in C#\n\nRandom rand = new Random(DateTime.Now.Millisecond);\n//Millisecond is the seed value.\n//Then if you want to select from a range, enter it like this:\nint num = rand.Next(minValue, maxValue);\n\n//To select a number between 0 and a max value use this:\nint num1 = rand.Next(maxValue);\n\n//To select any random number, use this:\nint num2 = rand.Next();\n\nIf you are using VB, just make sure to use the seed and everything else is pretty much the same.\nGood Luck!

"http://remove.getmirar.com/uninstall.html\nor\nUNINSTALL MIRAR !!!!!\n\nThis solution works brilliantly for WIndows Xp (if you are administrator/you installed mirar by your user)\n\nI had mirar installed on my laptop through some rogue site. I found many ways to ""apparentlly"" uninstall mirar ( like the one in http://www.spyany.com/program/article_spw_rm_Mirar.html) but I could not do it.\n\nThe entries in the registry are arbitary and not as given in various sites. Also I could not delete the file saying the file was in use . ( I did not have any IE open ).\n\nSo this is what I did :--\n1. Search for all *.dll in the modified range of 1 day ( I knew when it had got installed ).\n2. Deleted the files from &#92;windows&#92;winnb*.dll. But one file could not be deleted\n3. Removed all permissions on the dll file for all users using security tab on properties.\nMirar has vanished.\n\nor\n\nFirst I followed the steps on the following pages: http://www.adoko.com/resource/mirar-toolbar.asp\n\nhttp://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/adware.mirar.html\n\nThe bar was gone but still I had a pop-up when opening the internet explorer. Then I ran adware. It showed me all relevant files. But, I didn't want to purchase it, so I uninstalled manually.

I do not know the cause and effect, but I have never seen a computer running Limewire that was not also filled with Spyware. Perhaps it is just the get something for free mentality that leads people who use limewire to also frequent sites that distribute spyware.

Well, if your looking for computer programming related, is this what you meant?
Yahoo can take months to finally list your site.\n\nIts best to judge by a 6month time scale as it shouldnt be to much longer than that.
While you can send it with stamps, it is better to have it weighed and stamped at the Post Office so you have the postage on one sticker instead of covering half the package in 37-cent increments.  You also pay exactly what the postage costs, nothing more, nothing less.\n\nParcel post is the cheapest method of delivery for what you're sending, but sometimes Priority Mail (2-3 days) costs only slightly more, so it's worth it.  In any case, $1.50 sounds a little low given the weight of most shirts.  If you have a home scale, you can weigh it and type in the information at the Postal Service Web site to see how much it costs.  I'd only use stamps if you're trying to get rid of a bunch of them.
Here are the details.\nhttp://www.earthlink.net/highspeed/pricing/
"YES.\nI accidentally clicked on something that was NOT yahoo and entered my password- it stole my account and I could not log in after that. Now, I always directly type in the yahoo address that I want to go to rather than clicking on a link from an outside site.\n\nAlso, I once posted some artistic, but provocative pictures. They were nonnude, but apparently someone considered them adult in content or to be in some violation of ""terms of service"", and without warning that yahoo account and email were frozen. I tried to contact yahoo about this, but no real person got back with me. I had had this account since I was 19 and it was an annoyance to lose (luckily I download my email). \n\nI've known people (mostly men) who randomly IM others (women) in chatrooms or randomly IM after browsing online profiles and have been marked as ""spam"". Apparently if this happens enough, your account is frozen. I don't think that yahoo reviews the reasons people hit the ""spam"" button, it seems to be that if alot of people are hitting the ""spam"" button when you IM them then your account can be frozen. \n\nYahoo needs to have a better way to control the posting of adult content, and the unsolicited IMS rather than having a general ""spam"" button. Until their system for detecting and preventing ""real"" instant message SPAM is perfected, they need to have a place to check mark a ""reason"" (unsolicited business contact, adult content, harassing, etc...). \n\nIf you chat or IM, I would not use that email address as your primary email address because of these issues.\n\n... hope this helps :P"

"The History of Yahoo! - How It All Started...\nYahoo! began as a student hobby and evolved into a global brand that has changed the way people communicate with each other, find and access information and purchase things. The two founders of Yahoo!, David Filo and Jerry Yang, Ph.D. candidates in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, started their guide in a campus trailer in February 1994 as a way to keep track of their personal interests on the Internet. Before long they were spending more time on their home-brewed lists of favorite links than on their doctoral dissertations. Eventually, Jerry and David's lists became too long and unwieldy, and they broke them out into categories. When the categories became too full, they developed subcategories ... and the core concept behind Yahoo! was born. \n\nThe Web site started out as ""Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web"" but eventually received a new moniker with the help of a dictionary. The name Yahoo! is an acronym for ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle,"" but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they liked the general definition of a yahoo: ""rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."" Yahoo! itself first resided on Yang's student workstation, ""Akebono,"" while the software was lodged on Filo's computer, ""Konishiki"" - both named after legendary sumo wrestlers. \n\nJerry and David soon found they were not alone in wanting a single place to find useful Web sites. Before long, hundreds of people were accessing their guide from well beyond the Stanford trailer. Word spread from friends to what quickly became a significant, loyal audience throughout the closely-knit Internet community. Yahoo! celebrated its first million-hit day in the fall of 1994, translating to almost 100 thousand unique visitors. \n\nDue to the torrent of traffic and enthusiastic reception Yahoo! was receiving, the founders knew they had a potential business on their hands. In March 1995, the pair incorporated the business and met with dozens of Silicon Valley venture capitalists. They eventually came across Sequoia Capital, the well-regarded firm whose most successful investments included Apple Computer, Atari, Oracle and Cisco Systems. They agreed to fund Yahoo! in April 1995 with an initial investment of nearly $2 million. \n\nRealizing their new company had the potential to grow quickly, Jerry and David began to shop for a management team. They hired Tim Koogle, a veteran of Motorola and an alumnus of the Stanford engineering department, as chief executive officer and Jeffrey Mallett, founder of Novell's WordPerfect consumer division, as chief operating officer. They secured a second round of funding in Fall 1995 from investors Reuters Ltd. and Softbank. Yahoo! launched a highly-successful IPO in April 1996 with a total of 49 employees. \n\nToday, Yahoo! Inc. is a leading global Internet communications, commerce and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services to more than 345 million individuals each month worldwide. As the first online navigational guide to the Web, www.yahoo.com is the leading guide in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user reach. Yahoo! is the No. 1 Internet brand globally and reaches the largest audience worldwide. The company also provides online business and enterprise services designed to enhance the productivity and Web presence of Yahoo!'s clients. These services include Corporate Yahoo!, a popular customized enterprise portal solution; audio and video streaming; store hosting and management; and Web site tools and services. The company's global Web network includes 25 World properties. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., Yahoo! has offices in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, Canada and the United States."

The best thing is to get the GIMP.  It's a free image manipulation package that's easily as easy to use as Photoshop and best of all, it's free and installs easily without serials or keys.\n\nIf you must install and use that downloaded Photoshop, then I really can't help much with the downladed version as I have no idea what was downloaded (could be anything).  Plus, when you download stuff off Limewire, it could be the real thing or it could be a virus.\n\nThe GIMP is really a far safer approach.  You'll need to download two installer packages GTK 2 Runtime and The GIMP.  After that, install these two files and you're all set.  The GIMP does pretty much everything that Photoshop can do, in case you were wondering.

No, it's perfectly legal to share the connection throughout your network.  Think of it this way...  You think companies go and spend on multiple accounts for one building?  No, the use servers that have their own DNS, DHCP, etc. and use RFC 1918 addresses that are not usable over the net.  You're doing nothing wrong by that.
In just the way you described. Rule of thumb is to always put the largest and most reliable ram in the first slot. Then subsequent ram in the next slots. Also, its faster speeds when using less ram modules but higher megabytes of ram per ram module stick. Im guessing your using win 98 or win me. If using win95, you need to upgrade my friend! Thats over a decade old if so. Hope this helps. Good luck and happy PC'ing! Shuuutnstr =o)

It's a page that's the same every time.  A static page is stored in the web server as an HTML file.  When someone requests the page, the server just sends the file.\n\nYou can't tell from the browser what is a static page and what is dynamic because the web server can generate plain HTML that looks static but is generated on demand, and differently each time.
Format the drive or partition with Linux on it from within Windows.  Right click on My Computer and go to Manage, under Storage click Disk Management, then right click on the drive or partition with Linux on it and select format.  If you had seperate partitions they will stay seperate but you will have the space back.  If you want to merge the partition back with the main drive you will need a program like Partition Magic, http://www.symantec.com/region/au_nz/product/partitionmagic/features.html

Well it depends on what browser you are using.  If you are using internet explorer the simplest way it to hit the history button, but they most likely deleted those files.  You could download a program that takes screen snapshots and saves them to a folder or you could use a bandwidth monitoring program like PRTG Traffic Grapher, but that is a little more complicated and not ideal for what you want, but it will give you a general idea.  Do a internet search for tracking web activity or something like that.

There are ways to speed up audio content, but you need sophisticated software to do so. At least speed it up and maintain the pitch, that is.  I use Digital Performer. It is an amazing audio recording program that does everything, including time shifting audio. I have not tried to import a .wma file, but I think it might do that. Post the file somewhere and I'll give it a try. BTW, why do you want to double speed it?

"Digital Subscriber Line, or DSL, is a family of technologies that provide digital data transmission over the wires used in the ""last mile"" of a local telephone network. Typically, the download speed of DSL ranges from 128 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s depending on DSL technology and service level implemented. Upload speed is lower than download speed for ADSL and symmetrical for SDSL.\n\nA leased line is a (usually) symmetric telecommunications line connecting two locations together. Unlike traditional PSTN lines they do not have a telephone number, each side of the line being permanently connected to the other. They can be used for telephone, data or Internet services."

The query returns results that may look like a *table* but in fact it's a temporary recordset that isn't *stored* anywhere.  You can export to MS Excel and save the results in an Excel file - but within Access, the query results aren't stored / saved anywhere.\n\nYou could change the query to a Make Table Query - and then the results would be placed in a table when the query is run.  To change the query from a select query (the default query type) to a make table query - open the query in design mode, select Query from the menu - and select Make Table Query.  Enter a table name (any name you decide - if it doesn't exist it'll be created).  Good luck.
This has happened to me many times so what you should do is go to your modem and make sure all the wires for your interneet connection are plugged in.  You then should be able to find a way to test the connection, after all of this restart your computer, if not uninstall MSN and re-install it.... Hope it works!

"The other answerers are correct that the networking\nstack isn't functional in single user mode; however,\nthere is something similar that you might consider.\n\nIn many server rooms, it's common to install a terminal\nconcentrator that connects to the serial ports of\nmultiple machines.  In that situation, you ""telnet""\nto the terminal concentrator and open the connection\nto the serial port of the machine in question.  If\nthe console has been redirected to the serial port,\nthen you're in business.\n\nA similar solution which avoids the need for a terminal\nconcentrator is to connect the serial port of a machine\nto the serial port of a second machine via a \ncross-over RS232 cable.  Then you can ""tip"" from one\nmachine to the other.\n\nFinally, on newer machines (well, typically ""servers""),\nit's becoming common for there to be a ""service processor""\nto provide ""LOM"" (lights out management).  If this\nis available, you telnet to the service processor (which\nhas a distinct IP address from the rest of the system)\nand it will have the capability to take over the\nconsole.\n\nNot sure if this answers your question, but it seemed\nlike it might be related to the problem you might be\ntrying to solve."

To understand the answer better, I have prepared a small course on CD's for you. \n\n--How the CD is constructed--\nA CD is a fairly simple piece of plastic, about four one-hundredths (4/100) of an inch (1.2 mm) thick. Most of a CD consists of an injection-molded piece of clear polycarbonate plastic. \n\nDuring manufacturing, this plastic is impressed with microscopic bumps arranged as a single, continuous, extremely long spiral track of data. Once the clear piece of polycarbonate is formed, a thin, reflective aluminum layer is sputtered onto the disc, covering the bumps. Then a thin acrylic layer is sprayed over the aluminum to protect it.\n\n--The spiral on a CD--\nA CD has a single spiral track where data is burned on, circling from the inside of the disc to the outside. It is extremely small - approximately 0.5 microns wide, with 1.6 microns separating one track from the next. (A micron is a millionth of a meter.)\n\n--How things are written onto a CD--\nInformation are burned into the plastic of a CD in the form of small pits, or bumps. The bumps that make up the round track are each 0.5 microns wide, a minimum of 0.83 microns long and 125 nanometers high. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.)\n\nThe incredibly small dimensions of the bumps make the spiral track on a CD extremely long. If you could lift the data track off a CD and stretch it out into a straight line, it would be 0.5 microns wide and almost 3.5 miles (5 km) long! \n\nA CD drive has a laser beam which shines onto the track of the CD and picks up the bumps. The bumps are converted to information that the computer or CD player understands.\n\nIf you want more detailed information, visit http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd.htm\n\nHope I could help...

Well, don't be disheartened, but it is not the physical distance between the local exchange and you that matters when DSL is provisioned. It is the laying of the line that matters. If you stay close, but the cabling has travelled several miles to reach your place, then you are unfortunate.\nOther than that, there are a few other reasons for non provisioning of DSL. For example alarm systems on public lines, Splitters (also known as pair-gains or multiplexors) that allow several home tel. numbers to be on 1 line, multiple dwelling units (height issues), et cetera.\nIf DSL is not provisionable, I'd recommend CableNet which is capable of higher speeds thru optical fibre cables.

First of all, a wireless home network make no sense if you are using a dial-up modem. You should have either a DSL or Cable modem. If so, all you need is a wireless router like the Linksys WRT54G.\nThe router have to be connected to the modem and the PC can be connected to the router either wired or wireless. For indoor use wireless connection can cover distances up to 50 yards, depending on the environment (e.g. walls a.s.o.).\nI'm not familiar with the PSP, so i don't know if it already has a built in wireless card. If not, you have to get one that corresponds with the 802.11b (11Mbit) or 802.11g (54Mbit) specifications.\n\nLinksys wireless router (i'm using this router (v1.1) for 2 years now without any problems, but it seems the new v5 causes some trouble)\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833124010\n\nA considerable alternative is the D-Link DI-524 or DI-624\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127143\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16833127028

You can do this by attaching the scan photo to email....\nheres some info about attachments on yahoo on yahoo mail...\n\nAttaching Files\nAn attachment is a file that you can include as part of your email message. You can attach all types of files to your message, including word processor or spreadsheet documents, audio files, image files (.bmp, .jpg., .gif, etc.), web pages saved as HTML files, and more. You can attach up to 50 files with a maximum message size of 10MB (20MB in Yahoo! Mail Plus). \n\nWhen someone receives your message with the attachment, he can open the file in the file's native application (the application in which the file was created). He can also save the file locally and, in many cases, can edit the local file. \n\nFile attachments provide an easy way to share any type of document. \n\nHere's How\n\n\n1. Open Yahoo! Mail.\n\n2. Click the Compose button. \n\n3. Click the Attach Files button. (The Attach Files page appears)\n\n4. Click the first Browse button.\n\n5.

Yup, any object which sits inside another object is a child of that object.  That's all there is to it.  Normally, a child object will inherit the same rights and permissions as the parent object, but you can actually go in and change the permissions.  For instance, say you have a file folder for financial stuff.  The permissions for this folder may be open to all.  Then, inside this folder, you have other folders for each individual person in the house.  These would be child objects of the main folder.  You could then go in and change the permissions so that only that particular person could open that folder and no one else could, even though they all have access to the main folder.  I hope this makes sense.

"Technically a web server is a web service - of sorts.  It responds to HTTP requests, typically with HTML documents.  However, the documents do not adhere to the SOAP standards implemented by most newer web services so the only recourse is to hunt the HTML for keywords and tags that indicate where the data you're scraping for is located.\n\nSince you have some practical limitations on how frequently these devices could be called, my first inclination would be to develop a centralized ""collection"" service that periodically polled the various clarity monitoring devices and stored the data in a local database (timestamped from an accurate, central time source).  It would still do the ""scraping"" from the various devices, but would act as a proxy to minimize the amount of traffic each device was required to handle.  The polling interval would be based upon how frequently you needed to update the data.\n\nI'm assuming these devices can be accessed via TCP/IP.  Lacking any drawing tools, the architecture is fairly simple.  \n\n[Polling Server] -- [Clarity Monitoring Devices]\n    |\n    |\n[Database Server]\n    |\n    |\n[Web Service]\n    |\n    |\n[Clients] or [Web Server]\n\nWhat would help is if you have the ability to modify the web page on the monitoring devices.  If so you could customize the HTML response to conform to a standard SOAP document that could be called as a remote object from the polling server (instead of having to parse the HTML).  Alternatively, you may also be able to have the web server on the monitoring devices respond in an XML format that can be much more easily parsed by the Polling Server.  I am assuming this is possible since the web server on these devices provides clarity information on-demand (which typically requires some sort of scripting).\n\nIf you would like additional details, please e-mail me at melancholygiant@yahoo.com."

FTP is commonly run on two ports, 20 and 21, and runs exclusively over TCP. The FTP server listens on port 21 for incoming connection from FTP clients. A connection on this port forms the control stream, on which commands are passed to the FTP server. For the actual file transfer to take place, a different connection is required. Depending on the transfer mode, the client (active mode) or the server (passive mode) can listen for the incoming data connection. Before file transfer begins, the client and server also negotiate the port of the data connection. In case of active connections (where the server connects to the client to transfer data), the server binds on port 20 before connecting to the client. For passive connections, there is no such restriction.

the other answers are correct. generally the standard minimum for web developers is to create a page that can be viewed by a res of 800 x 600 or higher. anything smaller than that is somewhat obsolete.\n\nso shoot for 800x600 and you'll be fine
Well for one thing http://badurlgrandstreetinteractive.com/  is a spam site so I wouldnt recomend going on it or even touching a link on it. There is a chance of getting a virus everytime you get on it, and http://realdex.php/?tpi  doesn't exist.

DO NOT USE WINDEX!!! Windex has ammonia in it.\n\nOffice Depot has special TFT cleaning packets, but they are really expensive.

The easiest way to make a website is to use a product called Site Build It. The cost includes all the software you'll need..everything in one package. You get a domain name (of your choice of course) and unlimited space. Site Build It even analyizes your pages for SEO and submits your pages to Google, Yahoo, MSN and others. Its a great program that requires no knowledge of HTML. It doesn't take long to get started. I'm earning money from my site and I have zero website experience.
"Go to www.download.com, and search for ""ipod"". Look for any program that is like iTunes. Chances are, it'll let you download from your iPod.\n\nAnother way is to open your iPod drive, and on the Toolbar above, click |Tools|, |Folder Options|. Click the |View| tab, and look for |Hidden Files or Folders|. Click the radio button next to |Show Hidden Files or Folders|. A new folder will be visible, but it will be slightly transparent. It is called ""iPod Control"". Search in there for your music. It will have been renamed and everything, but it still will be the same as your origianl song. You'll have to do a bit of searching, unfortunately, but this is the best thing to do in the case of being at a friends house, where you're not allowed to download software."

"Function Overloading: This means having 2 or more functions in the same locality with same names but different NUMBER or TYPES of parameters.\n\nEX:\nvoid SetAString(const char* val) {m_someString = val;}\nvoid SetAString(const std::string& val) {m_someString = val;}\netc..\nthe functions are distiguinished based on the parameters.\n\nFunction Overriding: Two functions are said to be overidden  when they share the same name and/or even the same parameters(Number and Type) but are part of diff classes, one of which is inhereted from other.\n\nEx:\nclass B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, ""HELLO"", NULL, MB_OK);}\n\n}\n\n\nclass A : public class B\n{\nvirtual void SaySomething(){::MessageBox(NULL, ""NO"", NULL, MB_OK);}\n}\n\nthe result of calling SaySomething depends on the subtype of\nthe object\n\nIn short: Overloading is a method that allows defining multiple member functions with the same name but different signatures. The compiler will pick the correct function based on the signature. Overriding is a method that allows the derived class to redefine the behavior of member functions which the derived class inherits from a base class. The signatures of both base class member function and derived class member function are the same; however, the implementation and, therefore, the behavior will differ."

Phenomena that can occur with data in a multiuser environment:\n\n• dirty, or uncommitted, reads happen when a transaction can read changes made to the database that have not yet been committed.\n\n• non-repeatable reads occur when a transaction re-reads data it has previously read and finds that another committed transaction has modified or deleted the data.\n\n• phantom reads happen when a transaction executes a query twice returning a set of rows that satisfy a search condition, and finds that the second query can retrieve additional rows which were not returned by the first query, because other applications were able to insert rows that satisfy the condition.

ASP is Microsoft's first-generation Web scripting language.\n\nIt's not compiled code; like PHP, it is a series of scripted instructions to the server. The server picks up the page, reads the scripts, does what it's instructed to do, then sends the resulting HTML to the client.\n\nASP works on the Request-Response model: I ask the Web server for something (Request) and it sends back whatever I asked for (Response).\n\nASP.NET is compiled code. It is object-oriented, which means that it uses classes and other data structures to perform requested actions, rather than scripted instructions. \n\nASP.NET uses the Event model. In other words, if you click on this or type in that or make another thing, then something else happens.\n\nASP.NET is more like desktop application programming than ASP.\n\nFinally, ASP is a legacy product, meaning the day is coming when Microsoft won't support it any more.

To increase customer satisfaction, while minimizing the costs involved, many companies are turning to customer-based service applications such as Web self-service and online communities for customer-to-customer support.

"The Netflix monthly price for unlimited movies is lower than Blockbuster.\n\nFor less than $20 per month, you can get getting up to 3 movies at a time from Netflix.  Getting only 2 movies at a time from Blockbuster costs over $20 from Blockbuster.\n\nNetflix has really fast turn-around. They are based on California but they seem to have sending/receiving locations for the DVDs all over the country.  There is one within several miles of me. They receive my movies the day after I send them, send new one(s) out the same day, and I receive them the day after that.  I virtually always get 2 day turn-around, for stuff I mail in on Monday-Thursday.\n\nI had both the Blockbuster plan and the Netflix plan for about half a year, so I could decide which one I liked.\n\nThe Netflix was the clear winner, for me.  Here is why.\n\nThe local Blockbuster store was like a ""grab bag"".  I never knew if they would have something I would want to see.  It took 20 minutes to find what I wanted, which was usually not something I was wildly excited about.  Then another 5-10 minutes of waiting in line and checking out my movie(s).\n\nContrast that with Netflix.  They asked me to rate movies I had seen before, and they hit me up with some popular ones.  I rated the ones I had seen.  It eventually got in a groove with me and started asking pretty accurately which ones I had seen.  So it went fast.  Then, I had the hang of it and started searching on my favorite genres/actors/titles - and that really sped up the process.\n\nTurned out I had seen about a thousand movies.  While I was doing that, not all at once of course, I picked some movies for it to send me.  It sent the first 3 right away.  It maintains a ""queue"" for you - it's a line of movies that are waiting to be seen by you.  It is a lot better than waiting in line to see movies you barely want to see over at the local video store.\n\nMost of the movies in my Netflix queue are ones I really want to see.  There are several hundred in my queue.  As quickly as I watch and return the ones I have, new ones will arrive automatically from the head of my queue.  I pick the movies I want to see.  I cannot pick the movies I want my local video store to have on the shelf for me.\n\nPersonally, I haven't had any DVDs arrive from Netflix broken or scratched. I don't know why - you would think they would get broken in those little paper mailers but they don't seem to.  If you do get one that you can't play though, they have an online form you can fill out on their web site. You tell them which movie it was and what was wrong with it.  Postage prepaid on the return mailing envelopes too!  I think they send you a replacement one out, on the spot.  They seem to know their business and how to do it right - for the customer.  They have been doing this since the 1990s.\n\nBy contrast, a couple of times I have gotten movies from the local Blockbuster that I couldn't play.  I find fewer signs of fingerprints on the DVDs that come from Netflix than the ones I rent at the local Blockbuster store.\n\nNetflix really does make sense. It is cheaper, takes less of your time, no money spent on gas or postage, has really quick turn around time, and has a queue of movies you want to see that you pick the contents and the order of the DVDs you want to rent.  Their web site makes it fast to find the movies you want to see really fast - by browsing, searching, or glancing over their recommendations.  Their own users rate the movies, as well as critics - and you rate them too. They're like having a best friend along with you that has the same tastes as you, making it fun and easy to pick out what you want to see.\n\nNetflix is a good service, so try it out!"

Service Host (svchost) Is a program that runs services on your computer. Services are background programs that you don't normally see (like antivirus software, digital camera software, firewalls, etc) and that is the main program that controls all the services running on your computer. It has several instances because it usually needs one for each type of service it runs. This is completely normal, and is nothing to worry about.
"An expert system is a class of computer programs developed by researchers in artificial intelligence during the 1970s and applied commercially throughout the 1980s. In essence, they are programs made up of a set of rules that analyze information (usually supplied by the user of the system) about a specific class of problems, as well as provide analysis of the problem(s), and, depending upon their design, recommend a course of user action in order to implement corrections.\n\nTypically, the problems to be solved are of the sort that would normally be tackled by a human ""expert""—a medical or other professional, in most cases. Real experts in the problem domain (which will typically be very narrow, for instance ""diagnosing skin diseases in human teenagers"") are asked to provide ""rules of thumb"" on how they evaluate the problems, either explicitly with the aid of experienced system developers, or sometimes implicitly, by getting such experts to evaluate test cases and using computer programs to examine the test data and (in a strictly limited manner) derive rules from that. Generally expert systems are used for problems for which there is no single ""correct"" solution which can be encoded in a conventional algorithm — one would not write an expert system to find shortest paths through graphs, or sort data, as there are simply easier ways to do these tasks.\n\nSimple systems use simple true/false logic to evaluate data, but more sophisticated systems are capable of performing at least some evaluation taking into account real-world uncertainties, using such methods as fuzzy logic. Such sophistication is difficult to develop and still highly imperfect"
Registering your website is important, especially in the beginning as not many sites will be linking to you. Submit your website to all of the major search engines manually (AOL, MSN, Google, Yahoo) and to open directories (DMOZ.com, Zeal.com), this is free. \n\nHaving your website listed on these search engines will not assure you that your website is reaching a broad audience, if your not listed in the top 3 results pages of any search engine for whatever search string your website reflects you are missing approximately 90% of the search engine traffic. Not very many people go beyond the first couple of pages.\n\nMake sure your website is optimized with the correct meta tags.

In order to run a Java program, one needs what's called a ""virtual machine"" \n(VM) to interpret the intermediate language and run the program. The upside of this is that a Java program can run on ANY hardware and ANY operating system with an approriate VM installed. Also, the VM can do many things to ensure the safety of the program (Java applets on webpages can almost be guarenteed to be harmless). The downside is that IM languages like Java (or the Microsoft .NET languages, for another example) will be a little bit slower and cannot do some of the things that a lower level programming language could do. One simply cannot do things like write device drivers or access an operating system's API with a language like Java.\n\nIf you're new to programming, Java is probably a better choice to learn first. The Java library supports even advanced operations like graphical user interfaces or multithreaded applications. Java is easier to learn and easier to work with.\n\nOn the other hand, if you plan to program for a living, a good knowledge of C++ is absolutely essential."

It's possible. If you're using Outlook then click on the Export tag, chose all your messages from your inbox (or Outbox or sent..., you can make only one choice!), then choose how should Outlook export them (in what file format, i recommend you db2) and that's it. Then on your other e-mail account, using Outlook, or any software that's compatible, just import the file you just created.
You can't do that unless you have the premium (paid) account.  Or at least I've never been able to do it!

I can then go look at all your friends sites and someone on there will most likely mention their school, likely to be your school too, or at least in your neighborhood.  I can find your picture on your MySpace, hang near the school and stalk you and know all kinds of things about you because of your public conversations with your friends that you do not even thikn about other people reading.\n\nIn this scenario, did you use it to get a mate?  No.  Could you end up endangered by it?  Yes, the potential for it is there.

"I would say no. VB depends too much on the operating system underneath it. With, say, a C compiler, you rewrite the C runtime library for your machine and you can do this because you've removed all the dependcies on the underlying OS. But with VB you'd have to rewrite the entire VB run time which would require lots of reverse engineering and could not be done in VB itself!\n\nNow ""untrue"" OS? You could write a ""simulation"" of an OS in VB. Sure. But it would be slow and would not be too useful. I've written simulators for microcontrollers in VB, which is similar. But that isn't really an OS and really isn't very practical.\n\nYou might consider asking a more specific question about what you want to accomplish."

"DVD (sometimes known as ""Digital Versatile Disc"" or ""Digital Video Disc"") is an optical disc storage media format that can be used for data storage, including movies with high video and sound quality. DVDs resemble compact discs as their physical dimensions are the same (12 cm (4.72 inches) or occasionally 8 cm (3.15 inches) in diameter) but they are encoded in a different format and at a much higher density.\n\nA compact disc (or CD) is an optical disc used to store digital data, originally developed for storing digital audio. It is the standard playback format for commercial audio recordings today.\n\nA standard compact disc, often known as an ""audio CD"" to differentiate it from later variants, stores audio data in a format compliant with the red book standard. An audio CD consists of several stereo tracks stored using 16-bit PCM coding at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. Standard compact discs have a diameter of 120 mm, though 80 mm versions exist in circular and ""business-card"" forms. The 120 mm discs can hold 74 minutes of audio, and versions holding 80, 90 or even 99 minutes have been introduced. The 80 mm discs are used as ""CD-singles"" or novelty ""business-card CDs"". They hold about 20 minutes of audio. Compact disc technology was later adapted for use as a data storage device, known as a CD-ROM.\n\nTo simplify your answer.. \n\nCD hold a storage space of 700MB  and has standard quality\nand \nDVD hold up to 4700MB  Maximum quality on both sound and video\n\non standards"

A reverse proxy is a proxy server that is installed within the neighborhood of one or more servers. Typically, reverse proxies are utilized in front of webservers. All connections coming from the Internet addressed to one of the webservers are routed through the proxy server, which may either entirely deal with the request itself, or pass the request wholly or partially to the main webserver.\n\nThere are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers:\n\n    * Security: the proxy server is an additional layer of defense and therefore protects the webservers further up the chain\n    * Encryption / SSL acceleration: when secure websites are created, the SSL encryption is sometimes not done by the webserver itself, but by a reverse proxy that is equipped with SSL acceleration hardware.\n    * Load distribution: the reverse proxy can distribute the load to several servers, each server serving its own application area. In the case of reverse proxying in the neighborhood of webservers, the reverse proxy may need to have to rewrite the URL's in each webpage (translation from externally known URLs to the internal locations)\n    * Caching static content: A reverse proxy can offload the webservers by caching static content, such as images. Proxy caching of this sort can often satisfy a considerable amount of website requests, greatly reducing the load on the central web server.

The above is completely backwards.\n\nIntel CPU's are, by and large, far more costly than their equivalents in AMD, because Intel has a huge advertising budget they have to cover.\n\nHowever, in terms of performance, AMD continually outperforms Intel, in terms of electricity usage, temperature, and assorted benchmarks.\n\nThat said, the choice in CPUs does come down to what you'll be using it for.  If just office things, then stick to Intel.\n\nIf you plan to be playing games on the machine, than the Athlon 64 X2 is the processor of choice.

"Firefox still has a very small market share overall.  The reason why you see so many recommendations here for Firefox is that many of the people who would be attracted to Firefoxes' features are the same type of people that would answer questions on computer subjects.\n\nEdit:  Microsoft has put tabbing in as a feature of IE7.\n\nEdit 2: To the original poster, that people are lazy is a suprise to you?  Of course thats why most people use IE.  There is also the fact that 80% of the people that own a computer are not capable of downloading and installing a new browser, nor do they care to.  \n\nFirefox remains a niche market, one that will not take over for IE. Until Linux comes out with a package that my mother can understand, it won't take over the home desktop.  It doesn't matter what is better, look at the Mac, the Betamax, and all the other ""better"" products out there that lost to an inferior product.\n\nI thought this was a question, not a debate.  If you wanted to post a question ""What is the better browser?"" go ahead, but you asked if there were more Firefox users than IE, and the answer is no, and will remain no for the forseeable future."

I would suggest getting a new cord.  Just right down the information that is on the cord (voltage and resistance and such other things) and take it to your closest computer store and tell them what you need.  I have noticed that laptop cables do get hot sometimes, but that's only on old ones that I have seen--so it is probably time to replace it, if it is old.\n\nNote:  Resistance in electrical systems generates heat energy.  So, keeping that in mind, you may want to get a cord with less ohms/resistance.
"I just went through this.  Chances are, if you turn on the power to your computer (not the power strip, duh) and the light is out and it makes no noise what-so-ever, it's the power supply.  These are easy to replace and you can call your computer maker (i.e. Dell/Gateway/HP, etc.) and get a replacement.\n\nIf it's an odd-brand or you don't have the specs, still, pull the darn thing out (taking note of where everything was plugged into) and drag it to a computer store, Radio Shack, Best Buy, etc.   You can get a new PowerSupply for like $30-60 bucks depending on what it is.\n\nTake it home, plug it in.  If it don't work, pull it back out and take it back (Gee, I'm sorry, my wife bought this for me 'cause she thought it was a CD Burner) ... ;-)\n\nPower supplies last about 2-4 years ... The best advice that I've given you is to yank it out and take it with you.  Power supplies are all different shapes and sizes (a finite number of standard ones), but you don't want to order something off of the internet that has all the same specs and is just 4"" too tall to fit into your case !\n\nMy money's on your power supply.   BTW:  Did you check the fuse ?  Some older PC's have fuses.\n\nI hope this helps.  Don't be intimidated ... things only plug in one way ... when you're done and the CD don't work, open it back up and you'll be like, ""Duh, I forgot to plug that in.""    ;-)\n\nGood luck !\n\nP.S.

Get a home scale so you can weigh what you're sending out.  Unless you use a flat-rate box or envelope, what you send costs a certain amount based on how much it weighs.

Parcel post is the Postal Service's standard package sending service and may take up to a week or so for deliver; Priority Mail is 2-3 days.

"The reason why the yahoo file cannot be deleted is because is being used by a program. the only way to delete that file,is if you end the program. try restarting the computer and going into safe mode.  To do that, while your computer is just beginning to boot up, press the F8 key until you see a menu pop up. Select ""safe mode"" from the menu and press enter.  Once you're at the welcome screen, choose administrator.  Once you're there, click start->search and type in the file you want to remove. WARNING: this action might make some things not work."
It might help to explain the process of defragmenting.  When your computer is new files are saved whole and your free space is one contiguous area.  As files are saved, deleted, saved again, and so on, the free space on your hard drive becomes divided into little chunks.  When new files are saved into those chunks they must be divided and saved as several smaller pieces and then reassembled when accessed.  Obviously when your computer has to grab several pieces of a file from different places and reassemble it, that is slower.\n\nDefragmenting rearranges the files on your hard drive so that they are saved whole and in one place.  It also makes your free space into a single continous area.\n\nData on a CD or DVD is permanent, that is to say you cannot move or delete it.  Therefore you cannot defragment them.  In fact you don't need to for the same reasons.

"Don't buy it! It sucks. If you want to buy one google ""anti-spyware reviews"" or something similar and and look for an unbiased rating site or blog; they tell you the good and the bad and the costs. I tried several and the best two I've used are both free downloads. One is Spybot and the other is Ad-Aware by Lavasoft. I just bought this computer Saturday and the security upgrade I bought with it has Spysweeper by Webroot. I haven't used it yet but I remember it being one of the best recommended on some of the blogs. XoftSpy and a couple of others I downloaded for a supposed free trial let you install it and scan for problems, then want you to buy it before you can remove or quarantine anything. Then you can't uninstall some of them. Be careful when using any of them; be sure you read the instructions thoroughly and just quarantine or be sure you can reverse the actions in case you accidentally delete something that is associated with a legitimate file. If you have system restore, be sure to create a SYSTEM CHECKPOINT before you run and remove stuff. I will save you a lot of headaches if something gets screwed up."
How about this:\n\nDesign a system to help put together computers from various pieces of hardware, the system needs to know about the various components needed to make a PC, which pieces are compatible with which other pieces and which pieces are optional and which are required.\n\nProblems:\n\n1. System can build a computer round a single piece (i.e. Choose a particular motherboard/processor) by knowing which other pieces are compatible with that piece\n2. System can take a target cost (i.e. 2000 dollars) and can choose the components for the system without going over that cost\n3. System can choose which components are chosen based on what it shall be used for (i.e. Optimize system for game playing, or for Sound Design work or doing accounts on)\n4. System can be used to trouble shoot problems with a given system spoecification, so you'd enter a list of components you want to use to make a computer and the programe can identify where you are using parts which won't work with each other.\n5. System can take the description of a given system and provide information on possible upgrades (i.e. User describes his current computer, the system can suggest which types of memory card he can put in to increase the amount of RAM it has)

Do you want to ftp files automatically using scripts or do you want to design a ftp client. Ftping files in .net to me seems a bit tricky although just yesterday I discovered you can use webclient object which has an uploadfile method to do file transfers. The other question would be do you want to implement a pull or push ftp. \n\nEdit: Take a look at these links :\n\nhttp://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive9.html\n\nhttp://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/36s52zhs.aspx\n\nThe first gives you a ftp client library code which you can then use within your application. The second link talks about the webclient object and how to use it. There is a downloadfile method available with webclient as well. Give them a try\n\nhope this helps

HA HA HA! Trick question right?\n\nInno3d manufactures Geforce cards.\n\nnVidia doesn't really make graphics cards, they make the GPU ( Graphics Processors Unit ) on the card and sell it to manufacturers who put their name on them hence the Inno3d\n\nThe GeForce MX 4000 is an old card, a budget version of the GeForce range, the FX Card is newer, faster, has more functionality, so I'd go with the FX5500.
"goto http://www.symantec.com, get the system works and the firewall.

RULE OF THUMB. if you don't recognize the program don't allow it until you look it up.. yea its a pain in the butt but its really the only way to stay half way on top of it.

I called the guy in Germany on the phone, then is IP. The one in Guam was a college student. got him in BIG trouble. The university admin actually contacted me to let me know. and the person in prog.. I just got a hold of the IP and let them know. But to tell you the truth.. since I got behind a hardware firewall.. NO PROBLEMS!. get one (around $120.00) and BEEF up your security for Pete's sake.. microcrap has some killer freebies like malicious software remover and you get a free version of Adware from Lavasoft.. also.Spybot SEEK and destroy from Safer networks.. free free and free.."

A real time operating system has well defined fixed time constraints. Process must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. \n\nAn example is the operating system for a flight control computer or an advanced jet airplane. \n\nOften used as a control device in a dedicated application such as controlling scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, and some display systems. \n\nReal-Time systems may be either hard or soft real-time. \n\nHard real-time: \n\nA hard real-time system guarantees that critical tasks complete on time. This goal requires that all delays in the system be bounded from the retrieval of the stored data to the time that it takes the operating system to finish any request made of it. Secondary storage limited or absent, data stored in short term memory, or read-only memory (ROM), Conflicts with time-sharing systems, not supported by general-purpose operating systems. \n\nSoft real-time: \n\nA soft real time system where a critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains that priority until it completes. As in hard real time systems kernel delays need to be bounded .Limited utility in industrial control of robotics, Useful in applications (multimedia, virtual reality) requiring advanced operating-system features.

Firefox is safer, has tabbed browsing (which allows you to open multiple webpages in one window), and has many other convenient features.

The advice about getting spyware to clean up a trojan is bad.  Trojans are a form of virus, and good anti virus software is needed.  This specific trojan can usually be cleaned up with AVG anti-Virus.  You can go to www.majorgeeks.com and download the free version.  Then download the updates, then let it run it's scan.  When it detects the virus, have it HEAL the infected files.  This means it will attempt to clean it out.\n\nIf any problems, feel free to IM me CH_DHarden  (Yahoo messenger)

"In Microsoft Access, there is an ""OLE Object"" that you can use to store a graphic representation of what you've scanned (like a photograph), if that's what you mean.

The Geforce 7300LE is a good card. Since it's the Geforce 7 series you'll get great performance out of it.

If your not concerned about a budget, for all the graphics developing and photoshoping you might want to consider an Nvidia Quadro card. For your type of work they are 10000 times better than a gaming graphics card (Geforce series). But if you want to do both and don't need a card to perform ubberly like the Quadro, then go with the Geforce. Hope your going SLI, cause it's way better than AGP.

(Just like getting training in MS Word isn't really going to improve your report writing capabilities - you'd need to take a report writing class as well.)

He was talking about a DVD recorder, not a DVD burner.  \n\nIt is best to just install a buner.  A recorder is going to be difficult.  You would need an adaptor to convert the audio/video input/output to USB1/2 or FireWire. your computer.   Dazzle had such a device out, that worked for me years back to send a VHS signal to my computer.  I never tried sending the signal BACK to the recorder.  This could be difficult.\n\nYou'd then need software to do the job for you.
You can't, you would need to buy and reinstall the Spanish version of Windows on CD.\n\nIf you only need to configure your keyboard, sort criteria, etc., use the Control Panel to set locale preferences.  These only work for input devices (ie, your keyboard), and not output: you'll still get titles, messages, etc., in English.

This could be hardware, but it sounds more like viruses and spyware are degrading the system.  If it was hardware you wouldn't be using it for an hour.  I recommend you use system restore, or format your hard drive and reinstall windows.  This would be the cheapest way to find out, unless you have important data.

perhaps your NumLock is on. When the NumLock is on, only the keys that double as numbers will work - for example, J=1, K=2, L=3, etc. You can easily turn off the NumLock by pressing Fn and F3(or whichever key has NumLk on it) at the same time. Try and see if it works, or you can always call Dell services to speak to a Dell specialist.\n\nGood Luck!

It should play in either vcd player and dvd player if it is burnt as VIDEO CD.  I assume you did not burn it to be a VCD, you just picked the video files from your computer and burned them onto the cd right away.  making it a Data CD rather VCD.  VCD has a standard fromat. It has some folders like, CDI, MPEGAV, SEGMENT, VCD, etc. check if your CD contains all these or such folders, if yes, its a VCD and it should run, if no so, then its a simple DATA CD which is not recognizable on VCD/DVD players.

"I agree with Jonathan's excellent answer. I would only add one the following:\n\nSearch engine software will be dealing with strings and string manipulation in a big way, so you might want to think about native language string support. Native string support in C, for example, is weak at best, while C++ provides powerful string classes.\n\nOf the languages you mention, Perl has very good string support, suitable for a smaller scale project. My preference would be Java, however, for anything significant that needs room to grow. Consider a Java servlet running under Apache Tomcat with a MySQL backend.\n\nA modular approach is important, if you expect the project to scale into the mainstream. At some point, you might want to replace MySQL with Oracle, or the search engine backend with C++, while maintaining a Java servlet at the front-end, for example.\n\n\nAdded Note:\nDon't let anyone tell you there is one ""best"" language. That would be more like religion than technology. If you want the fastest, assembly language performs the ""best"" by far, but you'd have to write code for a lifetime. Always select the technologies most appropriate for your needs, while considering availability of skills and availability of resources.\n\nAdded Note 2:\nGoogle's technology is based on distributed computing -- massive numbers of PCs working in parallel. This architecture is not well-suited to a RDBMS. Google is one search engine, not every search engine.\n\nAdded Note 3:\nAvoid Windows for anything not on the desktop. Now that's religion!"

"Are you sure you have two drives or do you have one drive with two partitions?\nIf you can't put programs or files on the D drive, then it's probably locked (read only).  This most likely means it is a backup partition and should not be messed with, anyway.\nThe best solution would be to use the control panel's add/remove programs utility first.  Go down the list and uninstall all the programs that you don't use, don't need, or don't want.  If you don't recognize a program, don't uninstall it.  Next, clean your system.  If you're running Windows (most likely), then use the built-in disk cleaner by going to Start - Run - and typing ""cleanmgr"" (without quotes) and hit ENTER.  Select drive C and clean everything from it, possibly including the option that says ""compress old files"".  This takes a while and actually slows your performance slightly, but will be worth it if you need the extra space.\n\nNow that you've uninstalled some crap, you should have room on the drive.  Download a small utility called CCleaner from here:\n\nhttp://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/\n\nOn the right, in the green menu, click ""Download Latest Version""\n\nOnce it's installed, find it and run it.  In the ""Cleaner"" section, select everything under the Windows and Applications tabs. If you rarely clean your system, it will clear up a significant amount of space that the built-in windows cleaner wouldn't.  Under the Issues section, select everything under Registry Integrity and File Integrity.  This will remove many invalid entries in your registry and is safe to use without messing anything up - unlike other registry cleaners.  If you uninstalled a lot of programs, then there will probably be a lot of left over registry entries here.  This doesn't really free up space, but will make your computer more stable and fast - might as well do it while you're in the program.\n\nAlso, in control panel, open Internet Options - General tab - click ""Delete Cookies"" - Okay then click ""Delete Files"" - select ""Delete all offline content"" and click OKAY.  This will clear up most of the stuff saved to your computer from the internet, which can free up a significant amount of space if you've surfed the internet alot and never cleaned out these files.\n\nThere are a lot of other utilities that can be used.  The other ones I have I either paid for or downloaded illegally, so I won't even bring them up.  Hopefully by now you have some room left on the drive.\n\nAs for the automatic update in Itunes, if this still doesn't work, look at the settings.  I don't use it, personally.\n\nHope this was helpful and not too boring.  Good luck."
First you need to talk to your service provider...\n\nMany suppliers of domestic services won't allow you to run a service, because of the high traffic load. \n\nAssuming that they say yes, you'll need nothing more complex than a stand-alone PC running a server package...  Microsoft make Web Server, which does a fair job, if you learn how to use it correctly... \n\nAnother opition is to approach a server hosting company and rent space from them to mount your server.

"Back before Hotmail hit the scene, ALL email was ""off-line"" so there are literally hundreds of ""email client"" programs out there.\n\nOutlook has a ton of features, but it's one of the least secure programs out there -- in any halfway decent email client it should not be possible to catch a computer virus just by reading an email message, but in Outlook it is. Don't use Outlook. It's just not safe for your computer.\n\nEudora -- http://www.eudora.com/ -- is probably one of the most popular email clients. It's been around a long time, and it has a decent variety of features including multiple sigs, automatic spell check as you type (the squiggly red underline like in Word), and robust mail filtering rules. The down side is that to get all its features, you have to either pay for it or let it display ads while you read your email. Also, personally I'm not very fond of the layout and interface, but that's just a matter of preference.\n\nI am rather fond of Pegasus Mail -- http://www.pmail.com/ -- It has all the useful features of Eudora, and it's completely, totally free. Its interface can be a little quirky, but in ways that I actually prefer over other programs I've tried. \n\nI'd probably consider those the top two contenders, but if you go to http://www.download.com/ I'm sure you can find dozens of other options. One other you might consider is Mozilla Thunderbird -- http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/ -- I haven't tried it yet myself, but if it's half as good as the Mozilla Firefox web browser, I'm sure it's worth checking out."

telecom testing is a general phone company/ telecomunications company term. It's a very general term that could mean testing of some sort of voice/data equipment. you could look into a national certification call Network+ from ComTia. That could be a great introduction to this industry. Then you could look into a CCNA certification that seems to be a hot certification right now from Cisco. Do some reading on that, and I hope that will help you out.

You have 3 options.  The simplest is to double click the outlook express shortcut and see what happens when it opens.  If it takes you through the account setup wizard then you don't.  The other option is to click on an email link on the web somewhere.  This should start outlook express and run the wizard if there is not an account setup yet.  The final option is to go to the control panel and click the mail icon. This will take you into the email settings and let you check to see if there is one already established.
You can password protect the computer.  It should be in your control panel.

Plus I can pretty much build my own toolbar with Firefox with links to all my favorite spots, like e-mails, myspace, netflix, etc.  It's convenient and you don't need to install any extraneous software to add it to your browser.

"Well, for one: learn css\nThen, once you know css, get rid of tables.\nThen, switch totally over to div layers. \nFor example, to have a header image:\n\nin the css, put this:\n\n#header{\nwidth: 300px;\nheight: 200px;\nbackground: white url(imgs/header.gif) no-repeat;}\n\nok, now let's break that down: we gave the id a name. The name can be anything, as long as it doesn't start with a number. So, obviously since we're making a header, let's call it ""header""\nThen, we gave the dimensions of the image, and made the div those dimensions. Finally, we said to add the header image as the background for that div.\n\nNow, in the html, put this:\n\n<div id=""header""></div>\n\nThat's just an example. You can do anything: widths, heights, borders, backgrounds, background colors, colors, links, text...whatever. CSS just edits the html; it gives the html details as to what it should look like. \n\nAgain, learn it, get rid of tables, and use divs. \n\nYou can see some neat examples of css design at csszengarden.com"

I suppose you are having only one drive, that is DVD Burner. When you burn a DVD, an image file of the whole DVD is created on your hard drive, and the contents are burnt from that image file to the blank DVD. Once the burning is completed (in the blank disc), the image file is automatically deleted from your hard-drive. So, just wait until the DVD is burnt for your image file to be deleted.
the computer that you are trying to load it onto probably does not have the correct codecs installed to play those types of files.
maybe your isp is having problems, maybe you should contact them.  or, if you're on a contract and you have limited downloads, you might have used your monthly limit, and your speed has been dropped down.
"Start slapping. It's Photoshop. \n\nI can tell because it's a PNG. When I opened it in Fireworks, which is a PNG editing program, it shows a single bitmap image in the background layer -- which is exactly how Photoshop saves a PNG after you ""flatten"" the image (merge all the layers into one) -- and since this is a composite image made from several images, that pretty much seals it.\n\nAnother dead giveaway is the way the masks were applied to the backgrounds of each individual (that is, the background colors of each image were ""knocked out"", or masked). \n\nIt takes a pretty good image editing program to make masks as good as the ones used here, even if the subject is against a black background; in fact, it actually looks like these were made using clipping paths, which is a dead giveaway that Photoshop was the tool used.\n\nSo, if I was to guess how these were made:\n\n1. Each band member's individual photo was turned into a clipping path, to knock out the background.\n\n2. Each was then placed on a the final canvas and scaled to fit.\n\n3. Each member was then overlaid with a 20% opacity solid color, with a blend from the color it was starting at to the color it was matched against. That was probably done with a plug-in.\n\n4. The whole thing was flattened and shipped out to PNG, probably in ImageReady."

Yes you can.  Download Netstumbler and Ethereal (both free) and give those a try.  Ethereal is a freeware Sniffer, and depending on your wireless network card's internal chipset, you may or may not be able to sniff the lower level wireless frames, which would have MAC addresses, SSIDs, and everything else too.  But try NetStumbler first, it works great, and it will detect all other wireless LANs in your proximity and tell you what channel they're on (so you can detect if a neighbor is interfering with you) and if they have security turned on, etc.  Say for example you see your neighbor on channel 6 (common default) and their signal strength is good, then you can change your AP to channels 1 or 11 to minimize interference.

At the moment your question seems a little senseless. Please add detail to your question
change your IP number and make sure you have file sharing turned off. if you arent hardwired to a network then it shouldnt connect another computer
Theres a 3V cell on your motherboard. Just like the ones that you can find on digital diaries. I think the cell is weak and you need to replace it. The time keeps changing due to the weak cell. Happened to me. I changed it and my clock is working fine. \n\nOh and removing the cell will reset your BIOS, time, passwords etc. So make sure you set your time in the BIOS by pressing DEL after you switch on your computer.
Quite down loading FREE STUFF with out checking it for virus first.  Do your maintenance frequently.  Do your home work and find the best software that will do the job.  You'll find that everyone has their own favorites.  I use windows Fire wall, my service providers spy and anti-virus.  Plus my hub has a built in Fire wall.  This stuff is offered free and is updated regularly.  I caught 3 virus so far.  No other problems.  Note: I've tried them all.
in writing program code, semantic correctness means that the program code makes sense to the compiler or interpreter, ie. the program can be executed\n\nit usually means there are no typos in variable of function names, or program constructs\n\nthis doesn't include logical errors and bugs that might arise because the program hasn't been designed correctly

Open a checking account separate from all other accounts. Do not link it to any of your accounts for overdraft protection! Get a check card with the Visa symbol for that account.\n\nWhen you plan to purchase something via ecommerce, transfer the necessary funds into the account, then use your debit card for the purchase.\n\nI have had 3 fraud attempts to my account over the years, but the charges could not be completed because the funds were unavailable.  The bank called me, and each time we confirmed that it was an unauthorized use of the card number, so the card was canceled and reissued.\n\nIt dis not affect any of my other accounts and I have not lost anything...yet.
easy...there are lot of rom at romnation.net
All you need is a sound cable (the same cable that goes out from your sound card to the speaker or sub)and a piece of software(ex: Ahead Nero  Wave editor or creative wave studio). Connect your Cassette recorder's line out with your Computers SOUND card's line in.If you are using Live Value 5.1 then from the Creative Surround Mixer select line in as REC.Then start the recording software and play the tape....done (don forget to save)(if you don't have live value or mixer then use the mic in line)\n\nYou can also use your microphone in  instead of line in just remember to lower the mic volume a little and windows recorder as well (you need to press record button in the windows recorder as it stops every minute).\n\nWith ahead Nero wave editor u will also be able to remove the tape hiss if present.\n\nAlternately you can also record by a freaky method .Use a microphone to record what ever the tape is playing...\n\nAnd If you are looking for Audio manipulation. Then go for Cakewalk Sonar or a rare thing called Adobe Audition.I use Steinberg Cubase SX, Its the best stuff I got.
I buy some things on the internet because it is convenient and I can sometimes get a better price (though you have to take shipping into account). It's nice not to have to go fight with all the morons at the mall or the discount store just to get a DVD.\n\nOther things I can't see buying online - clothes, furniture, a car. Some things you just want to physically view and touch before buying.
Your cheapest alternative is to buy the Linksys WGA11B Gaming adapter (between $30 and $50 depending on rebates).  If you want to fork out the dough, buy the XBOX 360 wireless adapter (its $100 but runs at 611.A)\n\nI have been running the WGA11B with my linksys Wireless B wireless router and it works pretty smooth for gaming.  If you are wanting to stream stuff off your computers then you will want to go with a G or A wireless protocal though.

I guarantee you it will not.  Now, are we talking about a laptop or a desktop.  If we are talking about a laptop there is nothing you can do about it.  If we are talking about a desktop then you will have to go out and buy a graphics card in order for the game to run.  Anything above the Geforce 6600 or Radeon X850 would be a good choice.  I like the Geforce 6600GT if you're on a budget.  All modern cards support T&L (Textures and Lighting, if you were curious).\n\nThe reason it won't work on your Intel graphics controller is for one reason and one reason only, it's an integrated chip, no integrated chip (save for the Geforce 6150) is capable of playing any game, even old ones.  Even the 6150 isn't that great though it will play Doom 3 and older games, it would choke on FEAR.  That's probably more information than you wanted and I could give you more but I'll try not to get into that... unless you want me to (can always contact me if you want further assistance).
Server Hotfix. Try the link below might help a bit more.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nGood Luck.

do you have the windows xp disk ? if you do run it and choose to reinstall over the previous instalation when it asks if you want to format the partition that your putting xp on press f and this will reformat your drive removing any problems from the previous install. first save all important docs onto disk so not to loose them as reformatting will completley wipe your drive. and mske sure you have the other drivers for the pc.

Firstly 256MB is not nearly enough RAM for windows XP, i suggest that you go buy another 512MB Stick of RAM (its pretty cheap these days) and you will see a difference in the speed of your system also temporary files are as the name suggests files that are temporary these files are created when you install software extract things from compressed folders and download things from the internet. Temporary files are able to be deleted whenever with no ill effect to your computer. To do this goto Start -> All Program -> Accessories -> System Tools and click on disk clean up. This will scan your hard drive for temp files and will allow you to remove them and recovering some disk space. Everything in disk cleanup can be removed with out affect you system and how it runs

"It seems you have not setup a ""default page"" in your webserver configuration. \n\nIn apache.conf look for a directive called ""DirectoryIndex"" and change the corresponding entry to whatever your index page is called."
you should be able to uninstall the service pack sp2.   if this fails try going back in time in xp before the service pack was added to see if this resolves the problem.
it is a junk.they give you and e-mail that does not exist.law enforcement agencies must take action on this matter.i try to communicate with clickbank were the charge off w/o respond.i will notify my credit card for stop payment.
Check off the obvious first - try a different socket,make sure all your swtiches are on and everything is properly connected. If its a laptop, sometimes the battery needs to be in for it to turn on, even if its plugged in. check the electricity isnt off, and that the fuse is ok.\nOnce these are checked, you can consider getting the computer checked out by someone with experience
go to newegg.com I get plenty of pc stuff from there for cheap. They have pretty good things and they deliver fast. Delivery costs cheap too. Check them out. I bought a 1gb stick of ram for about 60 and it came in one day. you can find a nice video card.

One of the biggest disadvantage is the price, for what you get they are much more expensive, other disadvanges would be the battery life, the memory/space ussually isnt as good.\n\nThe advantages would be you can take it anywhere, they dont take up as much room and they make you look cool!

I use to be a Macintosh computer technician.  I really liked macs, they are easy to use.  They also are great computers to use for graphics.  BUT, I own a windows computer.  The cost of a mac is to much.  Windows computers are cheaper.  More software is available for the windows platform.  \nCost is the major reason that I picked windows.  As a technician, when people asked me which computer to buy, I told them to find the software that you like and buy the computer that will run that software.  Some software is only available on one operating system.  If both computers run the software that you like, then look in your pocketbook.  In my opinion, windows or mac os, one operating system is not better than the other.  They both have there strong and weak points.  Windows has more viruses than macs, but that is what virus programs (notice the s in programs) are for.  If you are practice safe internet searching, don't open unfamiliar emails, be careful were you go on the web, you should have a good experience.\nEmulators are great on the mac, but they do not run ALL windows software.\n\nI would prefer a mac, but I am not rich.  If I had a choice between mac os or windows os, say they were the same price, I would chose a mac.  The reality is, windows works great!
Once you sign in to hotmail, go to Option and scroll down to the bottom. There is a link to stop using Windows Live Mail beta (should say Beta opt-out).
go to www.download.com and search for audio editor.  there are many programs there that will handle that for you.

"Somebody got an F/A-18 fighter jet and tried to sell it on there once, but the government found out and made the owner sell it back to them.  I don't think we ever found out who sold it to the person in the first place, but he/she did obtain it legally.  So I guess it wasn't technically ""sold"" on ebay but I hope you'll agree that my answer complies with the spirit of the question."
The first thing I would is run spyware and anti-virus software. You probably have a virus. Afterwards download a browser like FireFox. If that doesn't fix it then it could be your ISP.

I'd be curious what DOS programs your talking about.  DOS since win95 has changed alot.  DOS, NT, win98/me have all been combined into XP.\n\nNote:  The next version of Windows isn't supposed to be compatible with DOS at all.
First you should check in your BIOS.  IT is possible that since the machine had WIN98 originally that the BIOS never had USB support turned on.  IF that is not the case then check with HP's site to see if there is an update to your existing BIOS.  This might have the patch needed to activate you USB.\n\nIt sounds more like it is turned off in the BIOS though.

It's likely that the site you visited looked up your IP address and decided you were not in the USA...  (You can get an approximete georgaphical lookup from some IP's, but the complexity of routing sometiems makes this very unreliable.)\nI'd guess the owners of the web site wanted to restrict the information to US consumers, perhaps for legal reasons, maybe because their products/services change from one place to another.
sure  ^_^ im winston_lao@yahoo.com add me up if you give me the best answer rate then il give you a very good testimonial
It's very unclear what exactly you mean. To type an address:\nType the first line of the address, click the Return/Enter key.\nType the second line, click the Return/Enter key.\nContinue to do this until the address is finished.\nIf you want to align the address on the right-hand side of the page, select all of the address when you have finished typing it and use the Tab key (one with two arrows) and tab across until the address is aligned on the right side. If you tab too far and part of line one moves on to another line, use the Backspace key (one with an arrow pointing left) to move back.

You have been given the information on how to find your ip...btw in case your wondering the answer with whatsmyip website is the most accurate for finding your global ip.  To answer the rest of your questions...if someone knows your ip can they hack your system.  Truthfully yes, but you can protect yourself with firewalls and antivirus programs.  Having a router will help as well as it gives you a form of a hardware firewall.  As for what is the deal with IP addresses.  I'll explain the IP address very simply.  Think of the internet as the Information Superhighway.  You need a drivers license to drive on a highway.  The most important part of your Drivers license is the License Number...it is what identifies you from other drivers.  Your Ip is your identification number for driving on the internet.  Without a valid IP number you are not allowed to drive the net.

So you could have each tune in its own file. This is for recording shoutcast radio channels. I could send you a copy of the program (just message me on here) if you fail to find anything better. You could also setup a bid request on http://www.rentacoder.com to get someone to program it for you if you like.
"First and foremost, because Almighty God (Allah) commands them to do so.   \nIn the Qur'an, Allah tells the believers to ""lower their gaze and be modest.""  \nSpecifically, it says:  ""Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them; and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do. And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; and that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their chests and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers..."" [continuing list of family members and others in front of whom women are exempt from covering] (Qur'an 24:30-31)"

load your pc in safemode. When you reboot your pc continue to press F8 and it will start in safe mode then scan your pc with avast or norton to get rid of it. If that doesnt work then the only other option you have is to reformat your pc which is simple just remember to save your Favorites folder and any other folder and music you wanna keep otherwise they will be gone. Good luck Further question email me page_12001@yahoo.com
Wow.  That must be messy.  Since you didn't reference any specific software, one can only assume that you are referring to a physical mailbox and the commercial meat product Spam.  There are a few ways to disentangle Spam from your mail box, but I would not recommend trying to eat the Spam once you have!\n\n\n1.  Spam is a relatively soft product.  You should be able to cut it off fairly easily with a sharp knife.\n\n2.  A strong jet of water from a hose should clear off any reasonable amount of Spam, including any residue left over from option 1.\n\n3.  If your mailbox is metal and not mounted on something flammable, you can burn the Spam off.  Note that Spam does not burn through, but will form a protective charred shell.  Once it cools, you should be able to brush this off easily.\n\n4.  If none of these options work, you might want to try the impractical, but thoroughly amusing method of letting a dog or similar animal at it.  If you can find a dog that will eat Spam, your only concern is that they don't eat so much at once that the animal gets sick.\n\n5.  If none of this works, it might be time for a new mailbox.
properties are usually the attributes associated with gui components eg. color of a label or size of a text box etc.\n\nan event can be defined as the transfer of control because of some change in the property of a component. eg. button click, entering something in a text box or dropping down a combo box.\n\nMethods are functions wherein you can define the action or activity that you want to happen when these events take place.
Most businesses these days are connected to the internet and generally they are using permanently connected high speed lines.  The lines mean that your employees have fast access to the internet and email.\n\nA firewall is a computer that sits between your business computers and the computers on the internet.  It is designed to stop malicious data and people from getting into your business's private network.\n\nA firewall is normally configured to severely restrict access from the outside world, but let anything from the inside get out.  For example you probably want people to be able to connect to your web server and see your website.  You're probably less keen to let just anyone into your accounts server to see how you're doing!\n\nA firewall will\n- restrict outside access to your network to just the places you want other people to see\n- mitigate or prevent worms (think of it like a network based computer virus) from attacking and infesting your network\n- mitigate or prevent DOS (denial of service) attacks against your business network\n- allow you to restrict and control employees access to the internet (ie disallow applications you don't want your employees using, eg limewire or msn messenger)

There's 50 odd posts about removing Moviepass but no-one seems to have an answer so I did some research...\n\nI've come up with what I hope is a solution which I've uploaded to here...  http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.html\n\nIt's also here as a Word document... http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.doc  and here as a text document... http://profend.com/answers/moviepass.txt\n\nI'm posting this same message to other people who've asked about removing Moviepass.  Instead of having instructions on lots of posts I've put them on a website so if I need to edit them it'll be much easier.\n\nOne comment that comes up a lot is that people haven't asked for Moviepass, it's just appeared on their computer and they're having great difficulty in removing it.\n\nAdware and spyware removers won't work as it's neither of these - it's an actual program (or more correctly several programs).  Pop-up blockers don't work as it's running on the users machine, not from the internet.\n\nSimply going to 'Add / Remove Programs' and removing it from there doesn't work as there's several 'sub-programs' and files that need removing.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback: did it or didn't it work, do the instructions make sense or not.  You can e-mail me at <yahooanswers at profend dot com>\n\nHope it works for you.
On myspace there is a search button where you can type in names of your friends or there is a section at the bottom on your home page that lets you find friends through you address books either in AOL, Yahoo or Gmail. After it is done importing your addresses, it will tell you who of your friends already have myspace profiles,and it will ask you if you want to add these people to your friends.\nTo get the cool layouts, and what not, there are tons of webpages that are associated with myspace.com...one of the most popular and the most helpful is mypimpspace.com.

You will want to use a server-side language (ASP, JSP, PHP) to create and save files on the server side in response to the client. Due to this ability, most free web hosts do not support the use of any such language on your site. Javascript is a client-side scripting language and cannot affect objects on the server in any way. The most it will do is send e-mails.\nSome free sites have their own prepackaged server-side gadgets that they let you use, like Tripod.\nIf you pay for your site, or have your own server, use PHP.
The DSN you get back should tell you why it failed (address doesn't exist etc) if you look at the message or possibly in the attachment it sends back. Their are various forms usually its because the address your trying to send to doesn't exist. \n\nThe other thing you get is delayed which is their is problem with the server your trying to send to, or a server on route to the one your sending to. Usually if its delayed for two days it gets sent back as failed. If your really really really really sure that the address is correct and that you typed it in correctly send an email to the postmaster of your internet provider. So say your using AOL it would be postmaster@aol.com or say your using BOG it would be postmaster@bog.com telling them your having trouble sending it to such and such an address. \n\nBut as I said chances are its something your typing in thats wrong as apposed to something wrong with the way its forwarded. Don't piss off the postmaster (s)he a busy person so only use it if your really sure its something wrong with the mail system.

CGI-BIN is just a folder name, much wil Windows or WINNT (on a windows based system).\n\nIt is a commonly used alias for placement of CGI scripts and applications, and this is where the power of many websites comes from.\n\nCGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a susbet of the HTTP protocol, in that you communicate to the application the same way you would to a web page.\n\nThat is, you call HTTP://domain/mypage.htm the same (mostly) as HTTP://domain/cgi-bin/mailtome...\n\nThe difference begins with the method of the call (GET vs POST - too detailed to cofver here), and also with what might be passed to the CGI.\n\nCGI can be written in just about any language you can think of (PC lingo's), and Java Servlet Pages and Active Servver Pages act much like CGI (they just don't need to be in a /cgi-bin folder). Fact is, nothing 'needs' to be in a folder called cgi-bin, its just conviniet to put scripts there because its so commonly used for that purpose, and lets you identify traffic purpose more easily.\n\nThe CGI-BIN folder/URL won't do diddly for your online form, but, the application you point the online form to is what will 'accept' data from your form, and do something with it (usually, database related, some computation, or email generation).\n\nWhat you need to know is \n1. What do you want to do?\n2. What language do you want to do it in?\n3. What web server are you on?\n\n(and if you are hosted some place)\n\n4. Will the host allow it?\n\nMany hosting companies have 'canned' CGI's available, but will not allow you to write your own (CGI-BIN is also the hackers favorite route to taking over your web server, it opens up some unique vulvernabilities).\n\nBest places to start looking deeper is your web host, your web server documentation, and the main support site for your language of choice (Perl, ASP, Python, etc...etc..etc)

Postscript is a page definition language. It is a very powerful language but at its root it is meant to descibe the lines, arcs, text, and images on a printed page. It was originally developed at Xerox Parc, and because Xerox had no interesting in commercializing it, some Xerox employees took it and started Adobe. Micrsoft then licensed postscript technology and the rest is history. Postscript type 1 defines an initial set of commands, postscript type 2 is a newer version that supports a wider set of operations. For instance I believe gradients are supported in type 2 but not type 1.

"The USSR's launch of Sputnik spurred the U.S. to create the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead. DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the ""eve"" network of today's Internet. In December of 1970, Charles A. Petrik contacted the U.S. Navy and suggested that a special communications network, that the Department of Defense had built for use in the possiblitity of a nuclear attack, could also be used during peace time. Petrik convinced the military to connect the computers of the U.S. National Laboratories for scientific research purposes, and to allow these labs to get data to other labs faster, and safer.\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by 1 January 1983 , when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. (This date is held by some to be technically that of the birth of the Internet.) It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nThe network gained a public face in the 1990s. In August 1991 CERN, which straddles the border between France and Switzerland publicized the new World Wide Web project, two years after Tim Berners-Lee had begun creating HTML, HTTP and the first few web pages at CERN (which was set up by international treaty and not bound by the laws of either France or Switzerland). In 1993 the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign released the Mosaic web browser version 1.0, and by late 1994 there was growing public interest in the previously academic/technical Internet. By 1996 the word ""Internet"" was common public currency, but it referred almost entirely to the World Wide Web.\n\nMeanwhile, over the course of the decade, the Internet successfully accommodated the majority of previously existing public computer networks (although some networks such as FidoNet have remained separate). This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary open nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network."

Windows Movie Maker prefers .WMV and DV-AVI files.  If you try to import other types you might get an error, or they might import and not work.  In these cases it is best to convert the files.  One choice is 'Windows Media Encoder' a free download from Microsoft.  It will convert many file types to WMV.\n\nAgain it depends on the file type, so if you need specifics on how to import a file, determine the file type and then go to www.papajohn.org > Import Movie Source Files > Video and look for the file extension.\n\nOr if you need more help, post the exact file type and the errors you are getting on the WindowsMovieMakers.net forums.

Assuming you want to format (clear) the harddrive, the first thing you will need to do is create a boot disk.  Once you have the boot disc created you will beable to start the computer from the boot disc and then run the format program.\n\nMore specifically, if you have a windows disc (cd) you already have anything you need.  Simply pop in that cd, make sure the system starts from the cd drive (May have to alter BIOS settings to make this happen. Hitting f10 or some other key combination while the computer is starting will get you to the BIOS setting screen).  This should allow you to drop down to a dos prompt and from that prompt you can run the format. \n\nAlternately, if you have a windows cd or recovery cd, you could use it to do all the work for you.  Most of them will give you an option to do a destructive install which is basically a format and re-install of windows.  This might be the easiest option for you.\n\n\nHope this helps.

"The term ""software"" was first used in this sense by John W. Tukey in 1957. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. The concept of reading different sequences of instructions into the memory of a device to control computations was invented by Charles Babbage as part of his difference engine. The theory that is the basis for most modern software was first proposed by Alan Turing in an essay."

In the onClipEvent check to see if the contents of the ID exist, if they do, then don't load, but if it doesn't then don't load.... basically, use JavaScript and the Document Object Model to determine state of the object, and only load if the object doesn't yet exist.\n\nI hope that helps and makes sense.  If it's not clear enough, let me know and I'll elaborate.

If it's binary, the best you can do is use a binary file reader that turns the binary into hexadecimal.  Even then it may not make sense.\n\nIf it's ASCII text just use notepad or wordpad if you are using Windows.\n\nEdit: try it in wordpad first, if you can read it - cool - if it's just a bunch of crazy symbols - it's binary.

They could have run into this problem in the olden days, then they were just giving my-id@yahoo.com type of ids. Now based on the country we select, they have started giving country specific mail ids. So for some one in India, it would be my-id@yahoo.co.in and my-id@yahoo.co.de for Germany and so on. This would reduce the duplicate ids problem.

My suggestion is... get a new disk drive... burner can buy for free after rebates... watch adds in paper (usually office max and office depot or bestbuy). Next. You can try system restore... you don't need to back anything up anyways, because you can still restore it to the future if it doesn't fix it. If it doesn't work you can just go back to restore, and click undo last restore point. Other than that... make sure you got no viruses, and download spybot search and destroy. Make sure it's cleaned out. Defrag, disk cleanup, virus check, spyware/adware check. If all else fails, when you buy the new drive, format and re-install windows. If it still doesn't work right, buy a new one... a mac should keep from future problems (but more expensive and less practicle). Good Luck!

Yes they are of course too many and it is really not easy to handle all of them. As a result, there are some tricky things to be done. For example, they use overlapping in terms of allocating the discspace. Suppose there are 10,000,000 users and it is really not that all of them are using all of their 1GB mailing space and the 30 MB of briefcase space and the unlimited space for photo albums and so for other YAHOO! Services. YAHOO! is allocating the necessary spaces only and when you are not using the full space allocating for you, the space will automatically be used by other users. Thus the need for the big wastage of storage gets reduced.

Bad sectors will appear if a drive is constantly rewriting the same place over and over again, such as on a badly fragmented partition.  Bad sectors appearing more often than every four months is a sign to start backing up data.  \n\nWhen in doubt, buy a new drive.  If you can live with a small size (20GB or less) you can find unused ones on the cheap to put into old PCs.  If you buy two and use them as a slave for data and master for programs, it's easy to replace in the future.\n\nIf you buy a new and larger drive, partition it with programs on one partition and data on another (say, 30/30 on a 60GB drive).  It will make tracking sector errors easier down the road.
Java is used in many places on the web because it happens to be platform independent.  That means you can create a web page and it doesn't matter if the viewer it using a MAC, UNIX, LINUX, or Windows machine, nor the browser they are using and they can still see all of the functionality of the site.  Unlike, for example, Flash which requires a plugin that is specific to the browser and the OS you are using.

"The answer isn't likely what you'd want to hear.  From the first site listed below, it is apparent that the Jet/DAO components and applications are not supported fully any longer.  That leaves you with a couple of not so good options.\nFirst, do a file search on the internet and download a few copies.  Make a survey of the file size and get a consensus so that you are fairly sure it isn't a tampered file.  Virus scan it very thoroughly and then install it.  Second option, find and purchase an older copy of a Microsoft programming product that will have the redistributable included on the CD.  This will cost you and you should only use an obviously factory produced CD for the same reasons I advised the gyrations with the downloaded file from option one.  If you do get it and it is critical to your system, be sure and archive it in two or three places and keep the media safe, sound and separate.  The third option is to download the MDAC 2.8 package and hope that it supports enough ""deprecated"" calls to work with your software.  I hope that this helps you out and wish you luck."

Well, RAID systems are good for a few things and all have their stengths in the particular configuration. \n\n1. Redundentcy: if you want to have a relaiable hardware system to avoid data loss through hard-drive failure, use a RAID 1, 5, 1+0 (mirrored then striped) or 0+1 (striped then mirrored)\n\n2. READ / WRITE: when you stirpe a hard-drive (make two or more hard-drives join together as one) you actually double the read/write speed.. so a 15K rpm drive becomes 30k with a second hard-drive of equal speed.  Use RAID 0 for read/write spped. \n\n3. MASS STORAGE: prety much any raid other then 1 (mirrored drives) will give you more storage room.. \n\nSo now ask yourself the following questions; \nThough you are not affiliated with a studio, do you need the read/write speed for fast render farms?  Do you need expendable storage? Do you need a large storage space for your work? \n\nI would say that if you don't have a very high-volume render farm, a RAID 5 can be an all-round robust and flexible solution for you.  You will gain read/write speed with the proper RAID card, and get the best storage and redundancy for the buck!\n\n\nGood luck! \n\n- Eyal.

There are a number of things that a digital camera has with a film camera, view finder, lens focal length range, max aperture etc.\n\nThere are some things that are unique to digital cameras.  Resolution is measured in points of color called pixels.\n\nLight sensitivity is controlled by the size of between 1 and 3 chips that contain the pixels called CCDs.  the bigger the CCD, the bigger the pixel and the more light sensitive.\n\nJust like there are diff rent sizes of film for classic camera there are different sizes of memory for digital cameras, both the physical size and capacity can change.  In a film camera one might use 35mm film that comes in 20 or 36 shot rolls.  in a digital camera one might use a compact flash card that could be any were from 128K to several megabytes.

congratulations on your laptop.  Having your own laptop is fun.  Finding internet access is easy:  a good source is looking in the yellow pages (if you are in the USA) for internet provider listings.  A lot are advertised on the TV and have 800 numbers to call, some are offered by the phone company such as AT&T ; AOL; Earthlink, Netzero, Yahoo, Peoplepc, etc.   You will need a basic server:  most come preloaded on the laptop--mind did and it is Microsoft Internet Explorer.   You need a server to get on the internet and then one of the on-line providers listed above.  I am not sure of what you would do if you are from a country other than the USa, BUT Dell could let you know what is available where you are.   Best wishes

Okay Archive means it is archiving the email from the INBOX..\n\nTo take advantage of Google Search, and reduce the time you spend organizing your inbox, archive your conversations. Archived messages and conversations are stored in All Mail, and are available when you search your account.\n\nSo when you check the option ARCHIVE, it goes to ALL MAIL.\n\nArchive is usefull if you have Labels. If you label your messages it is a total mess having your inbox with 10000 messages. ALL Mail does that. Inbox is what you have incomming , recieving.\n\nSo when you finished reading a message, apply a label to it, and then archive it to be hidden from INBOX. And it will be shown in the label.\n\nSo if you want it to be shown in INBOX again, goto ALL MAIL and select the option MOVE TO inbox.\n\nThats it

Could you be a little more specific? How does it change exactly? If it's resetting every time you shut the computer off then citalopraming has got it right, you need a new cmos battery, which is just a coin cell battery on the motherboard that supplies a bit of power to keep the clock right and the bios settings intact while the computer is off. If it's just changing by a few minutes every few days that might mean that the clock on your motherboard is a bit fast or slow, and every week or so the clock automatically syncs itself with an internet time server, and changes back to the correct time.

ok...what are you trying to do...is impossible...a common CD has a capacity of 700 MegaBytes and 80 minutes. That means that you can put on it tracks that sum up to 80 minutes of music(audio CD)...now...you can try the 900 MegaByte CDs that can store up to 85-90 minutes of audio tracks...but...you should use an MP3 Player or something similar...
it depends on which motherboard is in it and which model. the fastest that type of board would be upgradable to is 200, 233, or 266 depending the board. 233 was the highest pentium chip made, if it will take cyrix chips, then 266. go to Ibm support and seartch for your model, it will probably still have the spec for yours in aptiva support

it's actually MIMO - it is a technology that will allow an access point and wireless card to tranfer data faster than the wireless 'g' standard (with which it is backwards compatible)\n\nBoth the access point and wireless card must be MIMO capable to see the benefit, which is speed approaching that of wired (100Mb/s) - theoretically.  There are drawbacks, since it uses the existing 'g' standard...128 bit WEP is transferred much slower (around 20%) because MIMO doesn't support it.\n\nI would wait until next year, when the 'n' wireless standard comes out...better to upgrade to a 'standard' than a 'one-off' - kinda like choosing between dial-up with speed booster technology, or DSL - ya know?

I have been using a Linksys Network Everywhere NR041wm. This is a $40 wired router. I see in your question you are on BT. That is British Telco? That would be ADSL service, correct? I am not totally familiar with that but the router I recommend accommodated both PPPoE and DHCP. It is also expandable via an add on hub or switch. I have a 3Com Super Stacker II 24 port hub added to increase the number of ethernet ports from 4 ports on board to 3 on board the router and 23 port usable on the hub, for a total of 26 usable port to my LAN. These are available used for about $20.

Practice makes perfect BUT language code (syntax) isn't there to be remembered. Just remember the language's features: what it can do and how. In recent years, the syntax of most languages have become almost universal (except for some languages differing logically or which operate for different paradigms).\nApplying this on Javascript: \n1) Learn features of Javascript (its capability).\n2) Just rush through a good book of Javascript (not read it from head to tail but just rush, only reading those things which you didn't know about).\n3) Just go and code. Whatever the problem at hand it, go and try to solve it, applying changes to your code until you get it all right and running i.e. debug until its bug-free.\n4) Remember - the web is there for you. Any queries, ask the web.\n5) The more you try for alternatives, the more you will learn. Whenever you come across a solution that has been differently coded with different logics than yours, try to understand it.\n6) Last but not the least: Open up the javascript of your favorite site and try to make sense of whats going on.

Do you mean half way through windows loading before it goes to your desktop or literally as the system tray icons and all of that is loading whilst you see your desktop ?\n\nIf its between windows loading ie you see the scrollbar for a little bit and then it goes blank with the c;&#92; prompt you probably have something in your command.bat or one of those config files that points to somewhere or some file that does not exist anymore or it has a command in it that isnt a real command hence the bad command error.\n\nIf its when your desktop loads with the system tray icons then its probably a file that is in your startup folder or a startup registry key that does not exist anymore.\n\nIf thats the case use msconfig by going to start --> run and type msconfig and click ok or press enter, otherwise go to www.mlin.net and get startup control panel.\n\nIf it still does it then it will be one of your config files like autoexec.bat or something like that so might be worth while opening each of your config files with notepad and doing some research to try and establish what is meant to be in them.\n\nIf that fails you could always either do a restore to a point before it started doing this or use the expand command to expand the original configuration files over the ones you have now.\n\nIf it is your boot.ini file then you could go into the recovery console if you have windows xp or 2000 and use this command :\n\nhttp://www.computerhope.com/bootcfg.htm\n\nto allow you to rebuild your boot.ini file.

"This actually depends on the screen resolution of the person looking at the page.  The font size will remain the same, unless the user changes it, but a larger monitor may not have to scroll.  For example, if you have a background image that is 800x600 and a montior set at 800x600 resolution optimal, then the image will appear to be full screen to you.  However, on my monitor, it will look much smaller.  This is just an example ... not trying to say ""haha my monitor's bigger"" because I'm sure you or anyone else don't care.  \n\nAnyway, to make the words smaller, you can use either html or css. or both.  When you type in your own words, use <font size=""XX""> where XX is the size of the font, then at the end of the typing, put </font>\n\nTo do this with CSS, you would put the following in your about me section:\n\n<style type=""text/css"">\nbody, div, p, strong, td, .text, .blacktext10, .blacktext12 {color:#XXXXXX; \nfont-size:XXpx; \nfont-family:nnnnnnnn; \ntext decoration:nnnnnnn; \nfont-weight:nnnnnn;}\n</style>\n\nhope this helps."

There is not much difference between frames and packets. it's just naming. Generally, in networking, units of data that is sent out at the Layer 2 level, are called frames. for example, Ethernet frames, sonet frames etc. for Layer 3 onwards, the same thing is called packets, for example, IP packet, ICMP packet, TCP packet etc.

I really can't visualize what you are trying to accomplish. Could you please give me an example or more details, and also confirm that BOTH Outlook and Entourage are in the mix here? If so, do they both have unique mailboxes or is it the same mail account, and what kind of mail server?  I'm wondering if there is not a less convoluted way to get what you want accomplished.\n--------------------\nAdding this after you added more :)\nWhat kind of mail server are you connected to? And is the mail stored in the mailbox or on a .pst file on your computer? If you have Exchange and store the mail in the mailbox, you can script it but you don't have to have your script open Outlook. I'm a little rusty on this but if it describes your setup, let me know and I'll pull the cobwebs out of my head.  You bascially want the script to initiate the MAPI call, load the ipm.note forms on the server or prepare to put data in ipm.note format, input the data and commit it to the store. The Outlook client expects certain input for ipm.note and it does not expect to find it outside of the active window.\n-------------\nAnd wherever I say ipm.note I mean ipm.task--- it'll work the same for both.

"Control-Alt-Delete (often abbreviated to Ctrl-Alt-Del) is a computer keyboard command on IBM PC compatible systems that can be used to reboot the computer.This keyboard combination was designed by David Bradley, a designer of the original IBM PC. Bradley originally designed Control-Alt-Escape to trigger a soft reboot, but he found it was too easy to bump the left side of the keyboard and reboot the computer accidentally. He switched the key combination to Control-Alt-Delete, a combination impossible to press with just one hand (this is not true of later keyboards, such as the 102-key PC/AT keyboard or the Maltron keyboard). More advanced operating systems use its status as a ""reserved"" combination for various purposes, but often retain the ability to trigger a soft reboot in certain configurations or circumstances. David Bradley is also known for his good-natured jab at Bill Gates, at that time the CEO of Microsoft, and also the creator of many of Microsoft's programs: ""I may have invented Control-Alt-Delete, but Bill [Gates] made it famous"", alluding to the perceived instability of Microsoft operating systems."

It might be possible that you have a firewall not letting Yahoo! Messenger access the Internet, but if it worked once...then I don't know why it wouldn't work again. Just be sure your user name and password is correct, if that doesn't work contact Yahoo! Also, I just found this link, check sources below. That should hopefully help.

The difference is in the way they transfer ink onto paper.\n1. Dot matrix:\nThese are an older generation of printers and function in a way similar to a manual typewriter. The printer has a head with many fine pins and these can be arranged to form characters. The head then strikes an inked ribbon onto the print media.\n2. Inkjet:\nThese are quite common now. They are cheaper than lasers but the running costs are higher. They use liquid ink stored in cartridges or ink tanks. Through digital and electronic means, ink is squirted onto the paper by the printer head.\n3. Laser:\nA laser printer uses ink in powdered form, usually stored in a toner cartridge. The printer heats/magnetizes the media areas that need to be printed and then the toner powder is attached to the paper.

Most of time people are afraid of free stuff via internet because usually they have been victim of scams.\nHowever, there is good free stuff out there. The reason being:\n\n1. Advertising with your consent. Usually ones that are with bad intentions install adware, spyware, tracking software, key loggers, and etc. Good ones are ones that they want you to use their product and promote them by letting others. Good Example of good softwares are,\n\nwww.firefox.com : Less error/issues than Internet Explorer.\n\nwww.openoffice.org : It's same as Microsoft Office, except you don't pay for it.\n\nLinux OS, typically for people who doesn't want to pay for OS software.(I think RedHat Linux, you might have to pay for latest ones)\n\nwww.lavasoft.com : Good adware/spyware removal. Free for personal use.\n\n2. Feedback. Most of programs are tested and runs good, however in order to be tested they need to be run on various type of computer with various components which it would cost the companies sharply high. Best way is give out programs to general people to use and when there's error, it allows people to choose whether or not you want to send feed back data to them so that they can study.(Companies uses the error feedback to study them and fix/optimize their software)\n\n3. Good for the people that doesn't want to pay or poor. People that understands good and benefit of certain programs really can enjoy. Example of that would be using Yahoo messenger/service etc. \n\n4. Sales/Market promotion/Advertisement benefit by spreading programs.\n\nI hope these answer your question. ç=^D

Dear Houyhnhnm,\n\nProbably the best place to start would be to visit most popular program that pay per impression. It is\n\nhttp://adsense.google.com\n\nThis way, you will get paid, for the number of people who see advertisement on your blog, even if nobody clicks on the hyperlink.\nIn my opinion, this could be better solution for you. I saw advertising houses, such as www.valueclick.com dropping their pay-per-click (PPC) programs and switching to a CPM (cost per thousand) or affiliate programs (you will get pay for the actions your visitors take on the advertiser websites, such as: buying products or subscribing to email newsletter). Some affiliate programs, however, do offer pay-per-click, but will automatically switch you to percentage option (you will be paid percentage of revenue your visitors generate) if your conversion rates are low. Affiliate advertisers in the Investing industry pay some of the most generous rates.\n\nThe other website you should consider is: www.blogads.com.\nTheir ads are combination of image and text, and offer some very competitive rates.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nEdvard
"If you have an RGB port on the back you and ""share"" your desktop with an external monitor (mirrioring the desktop on both).  However if you need to extend (have your desktop use both monitors as one deskotp environment) with a laptop then you have to invest in an external box.  However your cipset might (and I emphasise might) be able to support dual monitor sharing.  Plug an external monitor into the port on the back and go to Display Properties and see if you have the option there to ""extend Desktop"".  If  you  do then the chipset supports it.  If not you can use a hardware solution like this (http://www.matrox.com/graphics/offhome/dh2go/home.cfm)\n\nHope that helps."

Well, I'll certainly try.  I like the cat ears, by the way.\n\nFirst, you'll need to find a program to publish the e-flyer in.  This can be MS Word, Publisher, or Quark.  I actually would recommend doing something like this in Fireworks or Photoshop, but if you don't have the budget for those higher end products, I wouldn't worry too much..  For now, I'll go with Word since everyone has that.\n\nI'm not sure what your making your e-flyer for, so that's pretty much your part.  Set up it up however you'd like with pictures, your bio, your service list, contact info, etc.  Whatever you'd like.  The trick will be getting people to see the e-flyer.  I would go about it two ways.  Create a .pdf file, and publish it to a web site and distribute the web address to potential clients (if you're a service based business).  To create a pdf, I'd download a program called CutePDF.\nhttp://www.cutepdf.com/Products/CutePDF/writer.asp\nIt'll allow you to save it as a small file format, and most users wont be able to edit it.  You can also save your file in Word as an HTML document that is automatically ready to be uploaded to a server on the web.  If you don't have a domain name, I beleive you can get free ones at places like Yahoo! or GeoCities (like me.yahoohomepage.com, etc.).\n\nOne other thing, when you're done, I'd screen capture the .pdf (by pressing the PRTSC button on the top right hand part of the keyboard), import the picture into Paint and edit out your desktop, and save the file as a .jpg file that you can insert into emails and send out.  Hope at least some of this helps, feel free to contact me if you need help or have more questions.  Good luck!

You need not format your entire drive just to fix the problem you're encountering. It seems that you need to update all your media drivers, that is, sound and video codecs in order for WinXP to recognize fully your hardware. Try to get these from update.microsoft.com, or use the driver CDs which came with your PC and/or hardware components.\nIn order to format a drive on which WinXP is installed, you'll have to go into your computer setup by pressing F2 when booting up, then configuring your ROM to boot from the CD drive. Then when you put in your WinXP CD, and restart the PC, it should restart in WinXP setup mode and allow you to partition then format your drive.
Go to control panel -> add/remove programs -> add/remove windows components. Put a check mark next to accessories, or double click on accessories and check everything you want installed back on your pc. It may or may not prompt you to insert your windows cd to fetch files off it.

Hi, I'm an Apple user - not a computer programmer or web designer, but I found some articles on the Borland website that you might want to go through by putting _ jbuilder Apple _ in the search box: http://www.borland.com/us/website/search/search.jsp\n\nThe Apple discussion pages turned up a few hits for JBuilder too: http://discussions.apple.com/search.jspa?threadID=&q=JBuilder&objID=&dateRange=last90days&userID=&numResults=15&rankBy=10001\n\nI hope you find your answers...  Good Luck!
"The hard drive and the motherboard are a great match. I would definitely go with that motherboard if i could afford to redo my system. The SATA 3.0Gb/s should work at the full speed since the HD and motherboard are matched on the speed. Also as you may or may not know the case has front USB ports and audio ports and your motherboard has a front audio header on it and USB headers to connect to those front ports. But it can be tricky to get the front audio to work right. You have been warned. Why not get this Plextor PX-755SA it burns DVD'S it is  130 dollars on tigerdirect or                        \nthis one Plextor PX-712SASW-BL it is a DVD burner too they are both SATA the last one is 70 dollars on tigerdirect.Or you could get this one  \nNEC ND3550A it is IDE and it burns DVD and it is 40 dollars at tigerdirect.Or this Liteon 52x Black CD-ROM OEM Drive 15 dollars at tigerdirect. Since all of the parts i mentioned are black they would look great with the black case. The case you picked looks very good. Yes the CD-ROM you picked should work. You will have more than enough room for all the drives you will be installing in the case. Yes the motherboard and sound card should match. Video card and motherboard should match. Power supply should also match. Th e Zalman fan should be good. The memory should be compatible as long as you use 184-pin DDR SDRAM. And you need a keyboard, monitor and a mouse and a CPU. As far as a CPU I would recommend the AMD Athlon 64 3700+ San Diego core it is 219 on newegg.Monitor i would go with Tyris T901DB Black 19"" 8ms (Tr: 2ms + Tf: 6ms) DVI LCD Monitor - Retail it is 233 dollars on newegg. But remember a monitor is something that carries on from the old computer to the new usually so get a good one. Keyboard and mouse is user preference which ever one you like get that one. Well so is the rest of it but i can't recomend a keyboard and mouse that is your choice."

Ive got the ticket for that, I had to figure this out myself. What I did was to get an AV box that is external, and cable to my monitor through the box, into the computer. I then used regular RCA jacks, and went with wireless pods, that you can purchase at Radio Shack, and hooked it up to my Television, through my surround sound. I have 5000 channels from all over the world, plus anything that comes up on my monitor is also on my television like a game or any movies.

well in case u want to pull back the older hard drive from the other computer u'll have to put in the good drive into the same first ide slot and make sure that the jumper is set to make the good drive a master(the jumper is a small plug situated at the back end besides the power supply socket of the hard drive--hope u know what i'm talking abt) next u will have to boot the computer from the hard drive now here u might experience a problem if both the mother boards are not of the same model as the drivers on the new drive will be different from the ones required for the new mother board ... so press F8(or u may do without is altogether) and try to boot in safe mode if it is successful then u'll need to reinstall the new drivers for the new motherboard or else u'll need to create a boot up disk or use a bootable OS cd and reinstall windows on the new drive again.\n\nhope it helps..\n\nregards\n\nvivek\n\nbe careful with the IDE cable

It sounds like your PC is being overwhelmed by one or all of the programs you're running.  It could be that one program is goofed up, or it could be that you need a little more RAM.  If it's an old computer, maybe it's time to get a new one.  It sounds like the easy way out, but considering how fast PC technology is evolving, there's no point in keeping a computer for more than 18 months... if you can afford it!

"Honestly, I would stay away from the “wholesaler’s” game. What once was a great idea has now spread so everyone and their mother is doing it. Margins are razor thin at best and I suspect non-existent when you factor in most drop shippers or wholesale clubs ""Membership fees"" along with eBay and PayPal's cut.\n\nTake something that you're knowledgeable about and wait for a bargain. For example, lets say you know a lot about cars and one weekend you stumble across a shop having a clearance sale - $200 car radio's for $30 bucks (or whatever). Take it home and list it for $75. Your customer thinks they saved $125 bucks and you made $45. Now multiply it by 100 sales and you are in business. I do about $2K a month in sales and I profit about $500 and that’s from just working part time. It's not ""easy money"", you do have to work at it, but if you're willing to invest the time and effort, you can do it."

wow! that's the first time i hear such an incident lol! \ni mean, some computers have parallel operator systems (like having win 98 and xp on the same computer) but it's how you managed to make it happen in another way, cos Windows usually tells you that it detected another OS on your computer, and the only way to install the new one is through replacing the old one.\nno problem. you could uninstall one (technically you can because you installed when an OS was already present...try 'Add/Remove Programs' feature)\nthe better way is to format your pc. don't forget to backup your files and folders to avoid regret!!
That depends on the programs you are having trouble with. The only think I can think of is if the programs that don't work are really old, then they might not understand your current sound card or drivers. To solve this problem, you can use a program calld VDMS or VDMSound to run the program through (just search for it on yahoo or google). For newer programs having problems, you might want to check to see that there isn't a separate sound control in the program that is turned off. Hope this helps...

There are two ways you can go about this.\n\n1.  Buy a network capable printer.  They run about $200-$300.\n\n2.  Install the printer on one machine and print through that machine.  It's really a pain in the arse, which was why I always recommend having a networked printer when you have two or more PC's.  Windows does not always recognize the printer on that other machine.\n\nYou can have as many printers as you have network connections available if they are all part of the network.\n\nAlternatively, you can hook up each printer as a loal printer to each individual machine.

Use percent values instead of fixed units(px, pt etc). \nGood point: This way your website will always be proportioned the same way in any resolution.\nBad point: You may experience inappropriate display, if the resolution is too big, or to small.\n\n2. Make different sets of templates for each resolution from 800x600, to 1600x1200, put a JS on your index page, that will detect users resolution, and serve the right template.\n\nGood Point: Your webpage will look as desired.\nBad Point: Some users keep their JS browser options disabled, therefore you won't be able to detect and serve the right template. It also implies a lot more work, than option no. 1

Many people donate their old PCs, but if you're strapped for cash, you could take it to a pawn shop or to a privately owned shop where they will probably refurbish and upgrade it, then sell it for profit.  Most likely, any of those options will leave you disappointed with the amount of cash you receive in comparison to what you expect to get.\n\nWhen I tried to sell my PC, it was easily worth over $700, but the guys at CyberXchange only offered a maximum of $300 to $350.  Selling it on Ebay actually has better odds.  You can expect close to, if not over what your asking price is.
Disk Fragmentation:\nWindows stores files on your HD in sectors.  there's a file called a File Allocation Table (FAT) that keeps track of the filenames, size, and occupied disk sectors of every file. When you delete a file, Windows doesn't actually delete the data of the file, it just removes it's entry in the FAT, marking those sectors as available.  when you save a new file to your disk, it will find all available sectors, and then overwrite the existing data.  when the file is small enough to fit into a space of available sectors that are phisically together on your disk, that is a contiguous file.  the read/write (R/W) head on your HD doesn't have to jump all over the disk to hunt down all the sectors of a file.  This is a good thing, because it makes accessing your data faster. But sometimes, chunks of avialable sectors don't always match the file size of the file you're saving, so it has to use available sectors elsewhere making the file fragmented {red areas in defrag} and your R/W head has to jump all over your disk to find all the data.  Bad and slow.  Contiguous files are good, and it's the point of fragmentation.  The other colors in Defrag are White, free space, and Green, un-movable files.  The green files are the special files that must occupy the same sectors, like your FAT and Master Boot Record.  And now you know the how and why of Defrag.

There are many reasons why this could be happening. To give you a more appropriate answer, you would have to be much more specific. For instance, do you have a Widows based computer or a Mac? (If it's crashing I'm assuming Windows). :P  What operating system is installed (ex. Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, etc.)  Next, we need to know what kind of hardware you have.  Is this a Dell, Gateway, IBM?  What kind of software is installed on the machine?\n\nFor now, I'll give you some ideas.  Perhaps your computer is freezing due to some software you added that is causing problems.  When did the crashes start? If you did not have crashes until after you installed or downloaded a program, that may be the problem. Try to remember, and uninstall any programs that you don't use or need.  \n\nSpyware/Adware/Malware can cause problems for your computer as well. Try to use programs that can detect these and remove them from your system. Some examples are: Spybot Search & Destroy, Adaware and Microsoft's Antispyware.\n\nDo you have a good virus scanning program installed?  Viruses can cause problems for your computer. Some examples of Antivirus software are: Norton Antivirus, Panda Antivirus, McAffee Antivirus there are also some free versions out there if you look for them, like AVG.\n\nThese are all software based things to troubleshoot, however, you could also have a hardware problem, like bad sectors on your hard drive or bad memory.\n\nThat may not help you or be too much for you to think about right now.  If so, here is a sure fire solution:  Turn your computer off before you go to bed.\n\nGood luck!

"Yes. It is software that has never been released and never will be.\n\nThe effects of security exploitation can be lessened by, for example, not using any secure data. That doesn't mean there will be no bugs. Ideally, no code would contain bugs. But we are talking about software - ideals are real.\n\nThe bugs are not in the software, they are in the programmer.\n\n\nNote to answerers below me:\nhttp://secunia.com/product/100/ <- Vulnerabilities effecting OpenBSD.\n\nThis is about programs, not encryption. If a program is encrypted, that does not mean the program has no security vulnerabilities that can be exploited (""cracked""), it just means that it's encrypted. Additionally, just because it may be much harder to brute force a doubly encrypted message does not mean it is impossible (and there are other methods for breaking encryption)."

Nero quite simply can't do it. Nero is a commercially made software so they have to abide by laws in place about copying DVDs. I have nero and have often gotten that error. If you need to pull stuff off the DVD, DVD Shrink is a very useful tool. It is capable of cracking any protection I have ever encountered. It also has an option of compressing or shrinking (hence the name) the content of a DVD. It can also directly access the Nero burning ROM so you could copy a DVD directly from DVD Shrink. Nero has the option of loading .vob files into it's video editor. If you need the whole movie as a single video file, just import those files you ripped in DVD shrink and export.

I agree with Norm on Norton. This site will answer your question, great information , I put a very small part of some of the information below, check this site out to get a better understanding to the question you asked..\n\nhttp://www.techsupportalert.com/free-vs-paid-av-part2.htm\n(It's a fair question. The current security threat is so great that you can argue that PC users should be protecting their machines with the very best products available regardless of whether those products are free or commercial.\n\nIn this multi-part series we'll look at the best free anti-virus scanners, anti-trojan products, spyware detectors and see how they stack up. \n\n1. No computer security product is perfect; all products have less than 100% detection. The choice between products commercial and free products is thus not a choice between perfection and something less rather it is a choice between differing levels of imperfection.\n\n2. In absolute terms the best commercial AV products such as NOD32 do have higher detection rates than the best freeware versions. However the difference between the rates is relatively small.\n\n3. By combining two or more freeware products it is possible to get better detection rates than the best commercial AV programs used alone.\n\n4. Layering is an attractive option for improving malware detection rates and may well offer greater opportunities than concentrating on looking for a near-perfect single product.\n\nIn the next part of this series I'll look at the effect of adding even more layers of protection)

the only advice i would give you is that if you ever met anybody on a blind date make sure you always tell someone where you are going , always meet in a public place and arrange for someone to call you on your cell phone 15 mins into the date so then if you dont like the person you can make excuses and leave. Never give out any personal info like your address never lie about your age or anything come to that.

if it is a built in card, I would suggest looking at the manufacturer's site of the board and model.  It should be an Intel, Asus, or some well known brand if it is a desktop.  If it is a laptop, I would suggest taking it in to a service center and if it is under warranty, to a service center that can do it under warranty.  Another way to fix it is to find the drivers.  Those would also be at the manufacturers site.  Yet another way would be to reinstall windows and hope that windows has its own mixer devices installed correctly.
"There could be three possible reasons why your sound card no longer works.  Assuming you had sound before, it could be the sound card itself, the speakers or the driver that makes the sound card work.  \nThe speakers are the easiest to get off the list.  Get a pair of headphones and plug them in ""input"" jack on your sound card.  If you hear sound, then it's your speakers, check to insure they are turned on and the wire isn't broken.\nNext is the driver.  If you are running Windows XP you can go to the device manager and see if windows thinks the sound card is working, if not use the windows hardware wizard to see if windows can sort things out and that also include the updated driver.\nLast is your sound card might be dead.  Well first check to insure it is still seated into the mother board if you have a plug in sound card, but you might have a sound card built into your motherboard and with that, you might need to disable your built in card and get a replacement plug in card."

I suspect it has something to do with how your domain is set up.  Since C:&#92; is local and right there it can access it quicker.  I have the same problem at work - if I save something to the network it takes a little while but no longer than 10 seconds.
Wireless card vs wires? It's wireless so you don't need to connect to wires! Primarily the answer is no. Your wireless card is built to have a specific antenna connected to it. \n\nNot only are you playing with a very dangerous theory and assuming you managed to isolate the power with filters, the impedance mismatch would not allow it to work. The power system (electricity) of your house  is connected to the whole world (well perhaps not that big but at least your suburb)! not just your house.\n\nIt is theoretically possible to utilise the power cabling in your house to run a LAN but this would not involve a wireless card; just a NIC, some form of adapter and extensive filtering would be required.
Printer ink costs so much because there is very little competition.  The manufactures of printers have a monopoly going. It is much like General Motors or Ford selling you a car and saying you have to use their brand of gas.  This would never fly but the printer manufacturers are getting away with it. There are alternatives like Pacific Ink, Carrot Ink, etc.  Found some very useful information on the subject\nhttp://www.pacificink.com/blog/index.php

"Once in a while a BIOS flash fails or, for any number of other reasons, your BIOS becomes corrupt, you will find that your system will not boot. With newer BIOS releases you may receive a screen that the AWARD BootBlock BIOS is attempting recovery and that it's searching for a diskette. For example:\n\n\nAward BootBlock BIOS v1.0\nCopyright (c) 2000, Award Software, Inc.\n\n\nBIOS ROM checksum error\n\n\nDetecting floppy drive A media\n\n\nWith older BIOS' (and at other times) your system will appear to be dead, with the exception that it attempts to boot from the diskette drive and then hang.\n\nIn the above scenarios, your BIOS is probably corrupt and the system is attempting to read the floppy. In these cases the BootBlock is attempting to recover your BIOS. The BootBlock is a portion of the BIOS which will sometimes boot when the BIOS itself has been corrupted to enable you to boot to a floppy and reflash. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nIn order to attempt the reflash, prepare a DOS boot diskette with no CONFIG.SYS (remember: if you prepare a boot diskette in Windows, CONFIG.SYS may be hidden by default, so it will be necessary to change your view settings in order to see it).\n\nDownload the latest BIOS for your board and unpack it into a work directory on another system's hard disk. You'll get as many as five files. The two you are interested in are named xxxxxx.BIN (replace xxxxxx with the name of the BIOS .BIN file that you are attempting to flash) and AWDFLASH.EXE. Copy these two files to your DOS diskette.\n\nCreate a single line AUTOEXEC.BAT on the diskette containing:\n\nAWDFLASH.EXE xxxxxx.BIN /CC /CD /CP /F /R /PY /SN\n\nNote the spaces after .EXE and .BIN and before each ""/"" in the above command.\n\nPrior to flashing with your recovery diskette, remove the power cord and open up your computer (you're going to need to crack the case after the flash anyway in order to manually clear your CMOS). Disconnect all drives, except your floppy drive.\n\nSeveral users have reported back that they were able to recover from the BootBlock when advised to disconnect everything except the floppy drive.\n\nTo flash with this diskette, place the floppy in drive A:, power up your system and (hopefully) after several minutes your system should reboot itself. When your system reboots, press DEL at the POST screen and shut your system down. Because your BIOS was corrupt, you should clear your CMOS settings manually using the following procedure:\n\nRemove the main power cord.\nRemove the motherboard battery (optional).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper (CCMOS1 on Abit boards) from pins 1 and 2 to pins 2 and 3.\nPress your power switch several times to discharge any remaining power from the motherboard.\nWait a minute or two.\nReplace the motherboard battery (if you removed it).\nMove the Clear CMOS jumper back to pins 1 and 2.\nReconnect your drives.\nClose up the case.\nRestore the power.\nPower up and press DEL during the POST to get into the BIOS setup screens and reenter everything.\n\nIn order to properly detect your CPU and memory, remember to start your reentry of BIOS settings with the selection of Load Optimized Defaults.\n\nDon't forget to remove the diskette (or you'll likely boot to it and run the flash all over again).\n\nYou should see what's happening on the screen with new motherboards. With many older boards, you will be running ""blind"" unless you have an ISA Video Card installed in your system.\n\nIf nothing happens and your floppy doesn't start to access after a few minutes, power down and try again - sometimes it takes several attempts to force the BootBlock to start running the flash.\n\nThe AWDFLASH.EXE command modifiers used above are:\n/CC = clear CMOS data after programming.\n/CD = clear DMI data after programming.\n/CP = clear PnP (ESCD) data after programming.\n/F = use flash routines in the BIOS for programming (force flash).\n/R = reset s"

"You're talking about Wi-Fi on a laptop/notebook right?\n\nActually, a wireless signal has nothing to do with your screen.  At least it shouldn't.  \n\nUnless you have one of those special laptop/notebook displays that have ""BrightView"" (or something to that extent), then you're probably going to have problems seeing the screen regardless.  I'd recommend sitting in the shade or face towards the sun.  Anything so the sunlight doesn't bounce off the screen.\n\nPlay with the contrast, balance, and brightness of your display as well.  That should help."

You shouldn't ask that to anyone. It suits your needs.\n\nIf you want a fast system, but willing to sit in a chair for a while, then a desktop should be what you get.\n\nIf you want a general-use system that offers mobility, but can't be as fast (without more money of course) and possibly a low battery life, then a laptop is for you.\n\nDon't let other decide. You will regret it.\n\nIf you're like me, though, you'll choose a desktop (even though I have both). They are generally faster (and for me, really fast because I play a lot of games... my video card alone is $600), and you won't get as annoyed of the screen as you probably would with the crappy LCD that even high-end laptops have today.
Photoshop is one of the top photo editing software programs you can get.  Very few people really need the main photoshop software unless they are editing pictures for a living.  It is made by Adobe which has a lower end product that you can buy for a lot less that will do a lot of the same type of stuff.  If you absolutely need this software you then hopefully you are a student or work at a university.  If so then you can get a discount from them that will make it less than half that price.  Beyond that you should try ebay as people often sell it there for less.

The Mailer Deamon is the name of the program on your email providers server that is trying to send out the mail. What it's doing is trying over and over again to send out the mail. It doesn't stop when it fails the first time because it doesn't know if the server that would accept the mail is just temporarily unavailable, rather than non-existent.

The problem with Sims 2 is that the Graphics Card must be Direct X 9.0c 'hardware' compatible, some are not!!\n\nOK. Click Start, Run and type DXDIAG, this little program will give you details of your hardware (relating to Direct X). Run all the tests and see if anything fails. Also make a note of the date of the graphics card software, then visit either ATI, nVidea or the manufacturers website and download the latest video drivers. \n\nIf it still fails you need to buy a new graphics card, ask for a Direct X 9.0c compatible card. From experience most cards manufactured in the last 18 months should be compatible.\n\nAnother tip while playing is to shut down everything else in the background, including your virus scanner (don't forget to turn it back on if you go online)

No, there is no catch.  For one that 6200 card in stores in probably the PCIe version hence more expensive, even on Newegg.  I think you're the one who is (was) talking about the 6200 PCI card.  Two, Newegg doesn't have to meat any overhead like paying retail employees to sell the products.  Three, they don't have to maintain any retail stores but they have three warehouses (soon to be four) spread across the US to serve the west, mid-west and eastern states with utmost efficiency.  I can't think of reason 4.  But unless otherwise noted, products on Newegg are new, retail versions of the same product you will find in stores.  OEM denotes the product does not come with all accessories, just the product, manual and essentials to get it working.  Newegg clearly marks items as refurbished, these items have been returned for one reason or another, re-certified by the manufacturer and are sold with all accessories as the retail version but may come in a plain box denoted refurbished.  Overstock items, well those are labeled too but maybe not as emphatically.  Whatever the case whenever you order from Newegg, you know what you're getting when you order it.  Items are, as I said, clearly marked.\n\nAnd to Sean who has clearly never visited Newegg, MOST of the items are new retail versions and not refurbished.  I think Newegg speaks for itself on this point.  If MOST of the items were refurbished, then they would be labeled that way since most of them are not, most of the items are new retail versions with a good few being new OEM versions as well.  Very few items on Newegg are refurbished but those that are, are clearly labeled.\n\nAnd the warranty is not 30-days, most items from Newegg have a 30-day return policy, I believe CPUs and similar hardware have a shorter return period varying between 7 and 15 days after which you still have the manufacturers warranty to fall back one which can very greatly between products.  I've been ordering happily for five years from Newegg, I've never had but one issue with one of my orders which was resolved with one email.\n\nPerhaps that's true for some items but I never buy the cheapest one they have.  I'm not the only one that thinks Newegg is the best thing since sliced bread, read the reviews at Bizrate, http://www.bizrate.com/ratings_guide/cust_reviews__mid--28697.html there are people that have not been happy with Newegg but they are in a minority (a very small minority).\n\nI'm not denying that some of the items may be used or refurbished but in my experience I have never seen Newegg misrepresent a product.  But then again, I just don't go and buy the cheapest one of the item I am looking at either, that's something no one should do.  Granted people have been burned by Newegg but Newegg is also one of the few stores that reply and follow up to bad reviews.

That depends on what you would consider integrated.  If you mean can COBOL call Java routines at runtime or vice versa, not easily would be my answer.  You would have to do some very detailed object compilations and hand linking to get the critters to work and play well with each other at all.  On the other hand, if your definition of integration is that they share a common data set at different times for specific reasons, they could quite easily be considered integral parts of a larger system.  COBOL, for example, being run once a day to do mass backups and create total files for a day's business and Java applets and applications being used while the business is actually conducted to create or update current sales and business files over an Intranet.  I hope this helps you out.

If a program installs over a program (same type of program mind you), sometimes things go wrong.  I've had this happen before, and the way I fixed it was to unistall the flash player using windows' add/remove feature.  This is found in your control panel window: (start/settings/control panel).  After you uninstall the flash player, go to macromedia.com (it redirects to adobe.com tho) and install the latest version of flash player.  This should fix your problem.  Hope you have success.

The fact that it froze at startup indicates a hardware problem instead of software. While the HP screen is up the computer is running what's called POST, Power On Self Test. it just runs a check on all devices in it to see if they are OK. If it hangs during post there is a problem with a device. There are beep codes that usually sound off indicating where to start looking. A healthy PC will emit one short beep at startup. I included a link for you to research beep codes. If all that seems like too much for ya. Just open up the PC, make sure you're grounded or using an ESD strap. (the static in your body can harm the PC components), and reseat all PCI cards, memory and cable connections. Close it up and turn it on.

Right click My computer and go to properties\nOn the general tab it will list how much memory you have.\nGenerally with memory, the more the better.\nFor Win 98: 128-256 Mb is good, over 256MB and you won't see performance upped much.\nFor Win 2000 or XP: depending on what you are running for software, 256MB or above.
This sounds like the place you would want to go:
go to www.yahoo.com and on the home page look for ansers then click on it
Right click on the desktop and choose properties in the properties box choose the screensaver box. Once there you can set the screensaver for as long as you think it will take to defrag or you can turn it off all together. If the screen still goes blan you should check the power setting in the same area. Most are set to black out after about 20 minutes. \n\nGood Luck
"Dear Dejav,\nYour pertinent question and urgent curiosity has unfortunately, been buried under more legitimate concerns. If you don't get an answer within 24 hours, it is best to delete your query and ask again.\nDejav, I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal opinion. You have been foolish, Dejav. Very, very foolish. Anyone can see that the purpose of Yahoo! Answers is to serve as a modern chatroom. More and more, Java programming is becoming less and less supported, there is no other method of bringing people together in a social environment than to create PHP scripts where the ""thinking"" can be done on the server rather than on your machine. With that in mind, Dejav, you should interrogate the shallow-minded participants of Yahoo! Answers with matters that appeal to their common denominator. Questions such as, ""How long is the normal tally whacker?"" or, ""My boyfriend says I should dump my hubby, what you think?""..., would get you a substantial number of replies.\nGive up your pursuit of truth and petty wonders, Dejav. Quit asking bland, colorless questions. Are you naive? No person who is capable of giving you the answer you hoped for can last while reading though a heap of puddings, pies and pastry. I'm only doing you a favor, Dejav, by giving you a proper admonishment you can now begin to formulate an apology. When you are ready, send your atonement to http://surveys.yahoo.com/user_ad_feedback \nAnd Dejav, if you insist upon asking serious questions, remember that a few good jolts from a peace officer's tazor should bring you around to your senses. Please, check your spelling and throw some slang into the mix so you don't offend any of the egos lurking, waiting to pounce on you with crass, thoughtless one-liners.\n\nThank you Dejav, and have a great day!\n-dylan"

"EL OH EL. Haterade on web communities eh? As for the person who said ""Go to xanga, it's a lot better"".. Um.. nope.

While you could sell them on ebay or possibly Craig's list, you should consider creating a web site to list these parts for sell. Use a pay pal or similar account to handle the money transactions for out of town buyers. I am always looking to buy good quality used parts for my discount computer repair business and would welcome a site such as this.\nFYI> I would be leary of Craig's List as it seems to me that much of the use of craigs list is for spammers to enhance their mailing lists.
Even if I invent that, it would cost too much for you to buy it.

"Don't be so concerned with getting a high burn rate. What would you rather do 'burn a coaster fast' or a 'good disc slowly'. Discs burned at lower speeds tend to be much more compatable with set-top players.\n\nAre you able to create a disk image of your project (File>Create Disk Image)?\n\nDo you have the latest Toast 7 update (7.0.2)?\n\nRemember the Latin saying ""Festina lente"" - Make haste slowly! \n\nFor anyone else out there facing the same issue...I figured out a cheap way to solve my dual layer burn problems...\n\nI used Toast 7.0 to compress my huge project onto a single layer disk. The quality was reduced slightly, but I was unable to discern the difference when I played the disk on my DVD player. So, until DL disks come down in price, I refuse to make any more $5 coasters. Yippee! \n\nMultiplexor error. The disk failed to be written: error code 0x80020042.\n\nBased on the rare experience burning disks other than Verbatim, that sounds like you're trying to burn too fast. I had that type of error using Fuji someone bought for me. Sent him home with those and used my Verbatim.\n\nI recommend dumping the Memorex and get some Verbatim DVD+R DL. And use the 2.4X speed in Toast.\n\nI've read here that ytou can create a disk image with the breakpoint and use Toast to burn it. Have not done that myself."

it seems you are trying to configure your outlook express to receive mail from yahoo account. \n\nyahoo POP3 server access is not free, u need to have a paid yahoo account in order to use that. Currently only gmail provides this service for free
I dont Think Theres anything you can do, all you can do is change youre password or create a new account , or change the email and also try keeping youre password secure. Also try Updating or get an better Antivirus and Firewall to protect youre computer from malitious viruses.
The easiest way to do this is with a password protection script. I have included the link to the best Free one in the sources box. Additionally I have included the link to my website just in case you need help setting it up.
go on the net and download limewire, or bitlord... LimeWire is a p2p (peer to peer) if someone logged on to limewire you can download it off them... hope this helps
if you want to start a real website, you have to pay for Domain name and Host service. domain name such as yourname.com should be available to be able to register it from www.register.com for example. then you have to pay for a host service. you can use yahoo website packages. if you want to start with a free webspace and address you can open a homepage in geocities.com. it has a file manager and you can upload you files easily. if you use a host service you have to upload your files using FTP tools.
Just go to Chat Rooms and start talking to people. a very good way to waste your time.

When you use an ATM, you are not directly accessing your bank account, you are simply placing a request for a transaction.\n\nTransaction requests are placed in a queue and only one will be processed at a time, for a particular account.\n\nEven though both requests are placed at the same time, they will be assigned different transaction numbers, and one will be picked for processing first... usually the one that gets to the queue first.\n\nAccess to the account would be locked for a short period until the first transaction is completed, so the second transaction would be held in queue.\n \nOnce the first transaction is completed, the lock will be released and the second transaction will be processed -  in this case, unsuccessfully.\n\nTechnically, this is called ""conflict avoidance"""

Actually PHP does not have a smtp setup within the PHP files themselves, that would be done by whomever installed PHP. I do alot of PHP scripts on yahoo's web hosting. I usually setup two files, one for the email form (a HTML file) and one with some PHP code to mail the information to my own mailbox. I'll show you those files if you want to learn some PHP in general, but if you just want to get this particular form working, I guess I can help with that.\n\nCheck out w3 schools for basic HTML form design and php.net for the definition of PHP's mail routine.\n\nAnother thing to remember, sometimes PHP will only allow messages to be sent to certain email addresses, like admin@yourdomain.com and so forth.\n\nDid you setup the PHP server yourself? I don't really understand the question all that well.\n\nI looked back at your page and noticed it was a tripod page. Is that who you're hosting your site through? Would you be using their PHP server? I need to know this to answer your question.
Well, 1st of all, for designing a web-portal (e.g. Yahoo! Google, MSN) We must design the template using Adobe Photoshp or any other one! Then, We make the pre-codes of the site using HTML and CSS language with the help of some web designer software like Macromedia Dreamweavor Now, We've got the basis of our site! We need to make it work! So, we use some programming languages and scripts which r available on the net like PHP and ASP, On the other side, VBScript and JavaScript etc... We can connect these kinda languages to MySQL or SQL in order to have a good Database... Anyways! There's a long long process in order to make a good site!...

Top 7 Windows Antivirus\n\nAntivirus software is must-have protection. This review picks the best antivirus software based on its virus detection abilities, features, and breadth of protection. Whether you're seeking total system coverage or an ala carte solution, each of the following products provides superb virus protection for Windows-based PCs. Because every system is unique, evaluate several of these antivirus products to find the software best suited for your PC and your level of experience. \n\n1) Platinum Internet Security 2005\nPanda Software's Platinum Internet Security 2005 combines antivirus, firewall, and spam filtering along with its new TruPrevent Technology. Both AV-Test.org and ICSA Labs have tested the TruPrevent claims of behavioral, non-signature detection of new malware. And both have found the claims to be true. (TruPrevent Technology can also be purchased separately as an add-on to other antivirus protection).\n\n\n\n2)PC-cillin Internet Security 2005\nBuilding on its solid antivirus capabilities, PC-cillin Internet Security 2005 includes spam and spyware protection, wireless device protection, firewall, privacy data protection, parental controls, and a year's free tech support via a toll-free number. The software automatically checks for new virus updates every 3 hours and the spam prevention includes a whitelist, blacklist, and Bayesian filter - all at a price substantially lower than many other antivirus suites.\n\n3) BitDefender Professional Edition\nSoftwin's BitDefender Professional protects against viruses, spyware, and instant messaging threats, as well as offering firewall rules to block undesirable traffic and a privacy gateway to keep your identity and preferences private while surfing the Internet.\n\n4) ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite\nZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite is best suited for computer-savvy users who want to know a great deal about what is happening on their system. Properly addressed, this type of permission-based reporting can offer great protection - but it's only as effective as the user's ability to make the right decision.\n\n5)F-Prot for Windows\nF-Prot for Windows continues to impress with its stellar performance on virus detection tests. The interface is extremely pleasing - easy enough for novice users to navigate yet sophisticated enough for the more advanced. An excellent addition to any antivirus arenal. Should be used in conjunction with a firewall.\n\n6) Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal\nKaspersky offers excellent antivirus protection, perhaps unsurpassed in its ability to recognize various compression algorithms and accurately detect infected files contained within the archives. However, their interface is rather convoluted and may be best suited to more advanced users. Should be used in conjunction with a firewall.\n\n7) G Data AntiVirusKit 2005 (AVK) \nAntiVirusKit 2005 (AVK) provides a double layer of protection, bundling two of the best antivirus engines - Kaspersky and BitDefender - under a single, easy-to-use console. Using these engines, AVK was the only product out of 35 tested by AV-Test.org in 2004 to achieve 100% detection of both the basic WildList viruses and its more comprehensive collection of zoo viruses. An ideal standalone scanner for those who desire an ala carte solution.

If you have more than one user on the computer, than that is the problem.\nat boot, windows automatically divides memory between users to prevent problems later on\nfor example\n\nIf u have 1GB of memory and four users, at boot it will give each user 250 MB of memory as if ur memory were being split between four different computers.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a solutuion to this other than deleting users.\n\nI'm not sure if this will work, but try disabling the fast user switching capability service.
UHHHhhhh...might be cuz they just started doing this service, and they're testing the responses of the public...i think more will be available later

get GAIM (on PC) or Adium (on MAC).\n\nThey let you sign-in to all the various accounts, so you can be online at the same time on yahoo, gtalk, msnmessenger, aol-iM, etc. all thru just one chat-software.\n\nSkype is also great. It lets you talk like on the phone for free, but you can also pay and call ppl on their normal phones. It's better than yahoo coz you can speak simultaneously (at the same time) like on the phone rather than only one person at a time.
Majority of the time businesses have special technicians who run random computer checks to see what is being downladed onto their computers. There is a BIG chance that your boss or someone else is looking at your computer. I would look for computer hacking sites to see if it is an possibilty that you can hide you activites (if you have any) on the computer. Also I would start deleting my cookies because those hold computer page memory. Two site I would check into to see if there is software available is Mp3rocket.com and Frostwire.com Good Luck

Short for IP Security, a set of protocols developed by the IETF to support secure exchange of packets at the IP layer. IPsec has been deployed widely to implement Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). \nIPsec supports two encryption modes: Transport and Tunnel. Transport mode encrypts only the data portion (payload) of each packet, but leaves the header untouched. The more secure Tunnel mode encrypts both the header and the payload. On the receiving side, an IPSec-compliant device decrypts each packet. \n\nFor IPsec to work, the sending and receiving devices must share a public key. This is accomplished through a protocol known as Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol/Oakley (ISAKMP/Oakley), which allows the receiver to obtain a public key and authenticate the sender using digital certificates. \n\n\nAlso:\n\nIPsec (IP security) is a standard for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by encrypting and/or authenticating all IP packets. IPsec provides security at the network layer.\n\nIPsec is a set of cryptographic protocols for (1) securing packet flows and (2) key exchange. Of the former, there are two: Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides authentication, data confidentiality and message integrity; Authentication Header (AH) provides authentication and message integrity, but does not offer confidentiality. Originally AH was only used for integrity and ESP was used only for encryption; authentication functionality was added subsequently to ESP. Currently only one key exchange protocol is defined, the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol.\n\nIPsec protocols operate at the network layer, layer 3 of the OSI model. Other Internet security protocols in widespread use, such as SSL and TLS, operate from the transport layer up (OSI layers 4 - 7). This makes IPsec more flexible, as it can be used for protecting both TCP and UDP-based protocols, but increases its complexity and processing overhead, as it cannot rely on TCP (layer 4 OSI model) to manage reliability and fragmentation.

"The simple answer:  Ad Hoc networks and Infrastructure networks run at the same speed.\n\nThe complex answer:  The speed of 802.11b wireless is rated at 11mbps.  The speed of a T1 internet connection is 1.4mbps.  Any way you slice it, your wireless is going to be substantially faster than your internet connection.\n\nFor ease of use and for security, I'd go to the store and buy a $40 wireless router and let it do the IP addressing work and the bridging work for you.  If you choose to manage it yourself, it's bound to cause you a headache and downtime someday.\n\nKeep in mind, that a wireless client will automatically down-clock it's speed when the reception degrades.  Also, all clients in a wireless network *must* run at the same speed.  Therefore, if one client down-clocks the speed, all the clients begin ""talking"" that slowly as well."
If you area novice web designer then I agree with what most people say here, the client pays.  In fact, I would not even disguise it in your prices, have them establish the service and then provide you the administrator/anonymous FTP access.  I think the going rate for novice development of web pages in my area (Texas) is $50 per page.  A web designer should get in and get out, which means no continuing requirements with web hosting fees. If, on the other hand, you are a web administrator, then you are talking more long term commitment. The only way I would suggest holding onto the hosting fees if you lease a presence on the web and sub-divide that presence among your clients. Many ISPs allow that and you collect the aggregate coin and pay the one flat rate to the ISP.  It's up to you, but novice should stay simple.

Thats a tough job for any software. LOL. Anywayz you could try this method. Download an mp3 cutter software, load the first track, cut the first line and save it as a separate track. Load the second track into the same program and cut the second line and save it as another track. Continue this until you have a large number of files which are made up of single lines. ( This will take up a large amount of space ) \n\nThen use and mp3 joiner software and join the tracks in the order you want to. This is quite tiresome and the result wont be music either.
Yes the original iMacs and the iBooks both use the same type of ram. The type in question is 10 ns SO-DIMMs.\n\nHowever the standard ram packaged with the iBook SE, was the 64mb attached directly to the motherboard, therefore it can not be removed. The only way you'd be able to swap ram over to the imac is if the iBook has been upgraded from the standard configuration.

Information systems, an interdisciplinary academic field that deals with the generation, collection, organization, storage, retrieval, and dissemination of recorded knowledge or the study of the collection, categorization, and distribution of data, particularly computer data. Information deals with the knowledge of an entrepreneur on how or what innovative ideas he can provide for a certain firm or company. A professional in info systems can actually be called as a consultant. Therefore it is important to us because the study teaches our brain to be more innovative and aggressive in doing business thru analyzing and data gathering in order to produce unique business strategies/innovations.

"There are two separate ways to make money from your podcast.\n\nThe first method is to drive lots of traffic to your podcast - which you do by excellent marketing and then having a great, compelling message to deliver when people reach the site. \n\nThen add affiliate adverts to the site and get a proportion of income as your visitors click on the adverts, when you have high traffic this will cover your costs.\n\nAlternatively, you can introduce paid for content. If you are offering great content that you think people might pay for, then you can charge for the podcast. Simply sign up with paypal or nochex and charge people for download.\n\nThe acid test is ""if this were a book, would I be prepared to pay for the content?"" if the answer is no then there is no point trying to sell the podcast.\n\nBest way is to get a loyal audience base first and offer some samples, then try to sell the podcasts from there."

Hi there,\n\nYou virtually answered your own question! The best solution for this kind of attack is an Intrusion Protection System (IPS). The best one currently available is a program called Prevx1. This is an all-in-one solution that is continually proving to detect, protect and remove more malware (virii, spyware, adware, trojans, etc) than all leading security programs - PLUS protecting against keyloggers and hackers.\n\nYou can read more about Prevx1 and download a free trial of their product from here:\nhttp://www.prevx.com
yes you can, insert any blank disk (floppy or CD) into the correct drive, open up the word-pad file, make sure it's the way you want it to be saved, go to file, then save as, name it the appropriate name, then find the name of the drive (CD or Floppy Drive) then click save as and it's finished.  When opening the file though if on another computer make sure the new computer also has the same word-pad program or it won't open up correctly.
you can erase the history of the search bars, you do this by clicking on tools then at the bottom click on options then from their you can clear your history.
If you have the win98 CD you can boot straight from it just go into your bios and set it up to boot from CD first to get into your bios press one of the keys F1, F2, Del, delete or F10, F11 ,F12 or Insert, just after you turn on the computer right after the memory test press one of them keys, normally the computer will say press F2 for setup/bios\nthen go through the menus and find the boot option/order and change it so you have the CD ROM to boot first then your hard rive then make sure you save the settings and exit and have the CD in the drive before it boots the computer and it should prompt you to boot from CD then follow the prompts from there good luck

That really isn't an upgrade.  Windows 98 was essentially Windows95 with a new logo and a bunch of bug fixes.  Most useful programs coming out now aren't going to run well on 98 if they run at all.\n\nThat being said OS9 is also dated.\n\nI would upgrade to something running Windows XP Pro or if you want to spend more and have fewer software options available Mac OSX. The upside to Mac being that you would be exposed to fewer viruses and have a flashy GUI.

When you copy cells with formulas in them, Excel changes the the formula to make a guess as to what your new formula references should be.  However there are cases in which you do not what Excel to change a cell reference.  By putting the $ in front of the column or row reference Excel will not change it when copying.\n\nFor Example: A1 contains 10.  B1 through B10 contains a series of the values 1 to 10. In C1 you create the formula =A1*B1.  Now you want to copy this formula down 9 more times to multiply 10 times each number but when you do the copy, Excel automatically changes the formulas and such: A2*B2, A3*B3, etc.  So to keep A1 in the formula all the way down.  Make your formula =A$1*B1 (F4 key toggles this).  Then when you copy the cells the reference to A1 doesn't change for all formulas

Junk mails are those which r mostly from online advertising/web marketing sites....\n\nWho sents it and how? Basically they get our Id from some linked sites wherein we have subscribed or smtimes through spywares/spam emails which we open. Mostly they get it from the subscriptions we make when we create an online account in any website/email site. Though mostly used for online marketing...somtimes r used by hackers for malicious activities too....\n\nWhy they go to Bulk folders? Coz bulk folder contains all the mails which are addressed to more than one individual...hence as these mails are meant for online marketing/spamming it contains multiple addresees.\n\nAnd above all Junk is a term what we give to a mail which we found is not useful for us but it may not be junk for somone who is relate to it....\n\nHence it totally depends upon individual perceptions...

Pretend you have 10 servers. You want them all to be mail servers, because you are running a DC (Data Center) and you have 10 branches, different parts of the country.  \n\nNow, you want data load balancing, so that not all of one server is taking the brunt of things. You also want to keep administration at a minimum.  So you cluster.\n\nNow that we have a situation, here's what happens.  You maintain load balance by having 10 servers, that are looked at as one. Say you have a cluster of ten and the naming convention is ms01,ms02,ms03, etc. until you get to 10 (ms10).  The cluster can be named clmail01.\n\nThis is great, because you are keeping load balance at a minumum, but what about the admin part.  \n\nWell, let's say you want to give Dallas and Houston (2 of the 10 branches) to use mail server ms04 and ms05, well then so be it, but whether it is Dallas, Houston, or Denver (another one of the 10 branches), they all see it as as clmail01. In real application, it would have to be an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name), so Dallas, Houston, and/or Denver would all see it as clmail01.domain.tld\n\nAnother big thing not mentioned is security.  This is HUGE, and by setting up clusters, you have increased security.  By setting up a cluster, you are more/less using a frontend/backend environment. This means that if clmail01 is attached and hacked into, the main mail servers (ms01-ms10) are not touched.\n\nPonder about this :)\n\nHave fun, and hope this has helped.

It typically means that it is designed or built with room to grow, or be scaled, when more users or more capacity is needed.\n\nFor instance, if you have a new company with 24 people and you buy only a 24 port switch and cram it into a small network closet with your server and UPS and phone system so that you've used all your outlets and used all your network ports .. then you really have built a scalable network that you can easily add users to.

Nope, not just any card will work. You don't give enough information to be sure from this distance, but here's the background you need.\n\nThere are currently two different WiFi networking standards. One operates in the 2.4GHz frequency band, and the other in the 5MHz band. The first began with 802.11b (max speed 11Mbps max) and continued with 802.11g (54Mbps max) and will sometime soon be extended again with 802.11n (probably about 110Mpbs max). All are backwards compatible in that earlier hardware will work with newer standard hardware, albeit at the slower speed. Note: in no case will you ever get the entire maximum data rate. There will always be handshaking and error correction and link recovery overhead, as well as automatic backoff in the speed attempted in the face of excessive error rates. \n\nThe other is 802.11a, operating at 54Mpbs (like 802.11g). 802.11a has many more usable channels, but much more limited range. It should not be expected to work at much more than a few tens of feet, as for instance across a room.\n\n========\nother factors affecting data rate in practice. \n\nsignal strength: This is reduced in all cases by distance, obstacles, inappropriately oriented directional antennas, mismatched signal polarity, low radio signal output (on transmission),  etc. \n\nother factors: rain, hot weather, inappropriate antenna connections or excessive antenna cable lengths, low radio sensitivity (on reception), multipath reception (caused by reflections -- buildings, airplanes, ...), ...\n\nAn older 802.11 radio standard (no longer commercially supported) operated at 700MHz, though at lower max data rates. The lower frequency gave greater range (all other things being equal) and better resistance to signal loss due to obstacles.

Okay instead of how to remove duplicate email address, try not allowing people to insert duplicate email address.\n\nTo ensure that, you need to make the emailaddress field in the table as UNIQUE INDEX... Once you do, noone could insert the same email address...\n\nWhat you could do now to remove duplicate email address is do this...\n\nBut I don't know your table structure so it is gonna be assumptions now... \n\n- This will delete all entries that have a duplicate including the original\nDELETE FROM thistable \nWHERE count(emailaddress) > 1\n\n- To just delete the duplicate\nDELETE FROM thistable\nWHERE count(emailaddress) > 1\nORDER BY tableid DESC\nLIMIT 1\n\nWhat this does, it deletes every email address that duplicates where the tableid (primary key) is the newest and I just want 1 so the other will stay inside the database..\n\n\nI hope I helped..\n\nNOTICE: I wont be held responsible if anything goes bad...\nRemember to backup your database at all times when preforming the delete query...
Let me begin by saying a degree is mandatory , to be specific a technical degree.It doesn't mean people with a commerce background will not get in.But it does happen that now since India churns out millions of engineers, its a little difficult for commerce graduates. \nIndia is now increasing dominant in the IT services sector which calls for excellent communication skills both verbal and written. \nNowadays a first class degree is a norm and it is difficult if you have a second class or below. \nNext is getting into a IT company. I really don't stress on getting into biggies and a small company would be excellent to start with because you end up learning a lot of things. usually companies have an aptitude test and once you clear it they have different rounds like personal round or an HR round where they test your behavioural skills and how you react to different situations. \nThere is no limit to knowledge and you can attain loads of skills. To begin with Internet programming is what I suggest. There is a wonderful site called www.w3schools.com which teaches basic programming.\nYou can begin with HTML and then slowly move on to ASP and SQl Server and then dot net.Once you get going there is nothing stopping you. Mind you....this site just gets you started and then once you finish off with the basics there are loads of sites which help you.

well, you might have to reinstall xp using the cd, but you can move all your documents from the old laptop in several ways. one way is to slave your HDD to the new laptop, which i believe you wouldn't have the right equipment at the moment. the other way is to burn your files from the old laptop on a cd, and copy them on the new laptop. the other way would be to zip all the files you want on the old laptop and email them to yourself, and download them on your new laptop. another way would be to use infrared or bluetooth if your laptops have them.\nshould i proceed or is this enough?

I had one person who never sent the item, but luckily I used Paypal and got a refund from the seller when contacted. I am always leery of those Hong Kong items, they seem like they are cheap junk that wouldn't pass safety standards in US or Canada . Using PayPal is a good safeguard. I have been on Ebay for 8 years and have had mostly good luck both buying and selling.

It really depends on how you define computer.  If you mean a programmable, electronic, digital computer, then most of the first ones were built around or just after World War II, and many of the applications were military.  For example, the ENIAC was built under contract for the military so that artillery tables could be computed more quickly.  But the war ended before the computer was finished.\n\nIncidentally, Ada was not a computer, but a famous person in the history of computing (Ada Lovelace).  In the 1980s, a programming languagfe was named Ada in her honor.

My suggestion for learning java is always the same... pick up a copy of Teach Yourself Java in 21 days, and code every program in there. Mess with them. Change them to do different things. Combine a bunch of them to do something cool. You'll learn what you're doing, and then you'll be able to do what you want to do.\n\nThe current version is several editions removed from what I learned on, but it did great things for me when I was learning.\n\nCheck around for the best price. Since the current version has been out for a while, you might be able to find it used somewhere, too.

Try the degaus feature on your monitor. It is probably not the monitor though. E-machines are the biggest pieces of crap. You get what you pay for. They use the cheapest parts. The video card is either crap or you may have wiped the driver for it out. Right click on an open area of your desktop and select properties. Then click on the settings tab. Your color should be set to at least 16bit. If you cannot select anything higher than 256 then your video card drivers probably were not restored. You can check by right clicking on my computer and select properties. Then click on the hardware tab. Then click on the device manager tab. If there are yellow circles with exclamation points in them. That means that there is a piece of equipment that the computer don't recognize. Probably need drivers.

If it is a Windows system, what is happening is the system is going into hibernation when you close the lid.  Hibernation causes all the internal electronics, including the display drivers to shut down as an energy and power savings technique.  You can change this by going into the control panel and selecting Display.  Somewhere in this folder are the options that allow you to select what you want the system to do under what conditions, such as lowering the display.  If you need help, select Help on the menu bar and search for display power settings.

It all depends on your experience and knowledge in website creation. I create simple HTML web pages as one of my hobbies, but if anyone were to ask me to build them a simple website, I would charge them at least $30 an hour (... but so far, no one has asked, lol).\n\nBut since Flash is a bit higher up on the scale than HTML, I would go probably just a little higher in rate that what I would ask. Most companies that specialize in this field usually ask for big $$$! Also, could you actually make money (and not take a loss) if you were to charge X amount?\n\nShow them you are capable of doing the job by asking them a slightly lower rate than the big companies, and if they hire you and appreciate your work, they may hire you to do more web pages...

It would be hard as you will fresher but that is you have to prove that you can do.\n\nSecond options do find job in Lebanon it self with LAN management which is good for experience. Even bigger LAN management is challenging job.\n\nGetting job with MCSE is not Q but is there job around in local market or international market. If you have I.Q for programming (It is not I.Q but urge to make programs) then it can be clubbed with networking that can pay really well. \n\nPassing MCSE through dumps can lead you nowhere well Passing that could make you eligible but that wouldn’t teach you much it is all you have to decide.\n\nLinux is another good option and there are business who wants free software to deployed in there networks. Only issue lack of trained Linux engineer and programmer for there in built requirements. \n\nHope you can decide on it.

In general, if you don't really need a wireless router, then don't get one.   The old fashioned wire is more reliable, less costly to buy, less costly to maintain and more secure from intrusion. You grow fond of the wires that run all over your house. If you do use a wireless router, Use the Security Features, and Write Down the Passwords.\n\nOpen the Command Prompt from the Accessories folder, found in the Programs section of your Start Menu \nType this IPCONFIG command, followed by the ENTER key to display your computer's IP configuration.\n\nC:&#92;>ipconfig\n\nUse the PING commend to PING the gateway address 1,000 times, using the following command:\n\nC:&#92;>ping 192.168.0.1 /n 1000\n\nThis simple test will tell you how many times your router did not answer.  This 15 minute test will give you a good handle on if your router is reliable.  (other than simply signal strength).
"9. I get a 'Power calibration error' or 'Calibration area (almost) full' error message. Why?\n\nPower Calibration is controlled by the recorder.\n\nBefore any write operation, all recorders must do a 15 step power test to determine the optimum power for writing to the CD; this is called ""Optimum Power Calibration""(OPC). During the write, it continues to do this test to get the best write throughout the whole CD; this is called ""Running Optimum Power Calibration"" (ROPC).\nThis whole process is controlled by the recorder, though initiated by programs such as Nero. There is an area on the inner part of the CD for the test and test data info to be stored. You can use this area up to 999 times.\n\nIf you receive the ""Power calibration error"" or ""Power calibration area is (amost) full"" error message, the cause will be either poor media, poor power, or a defective recorder.\n\nPlease try the following solutions:\n\n    * Update the firmware of your recorder. Please check the manufacturer's website for the latest version.\n    * Try another brand of CD-R or CD-RW media.\n    * Try different power connectors, and for recorders, do not share power with other devices. It needs its own power connector. If the error occurs with an external recorder, the power source in the chassis could be the cause. As a test, try to take the recorder out of the external chassis and connect it internal.\n    * Try different configurations, such as taking the CD-ROM to the primary IDE bus as slave and have only the recorder connected to the secondary IDE bus as master.\n    * Send the recorder in for service."

"Because of the very nature of stability in the universe.  There is balance in everything.  One could, for instance, take the Platonic argument of opposites - by virtue of the fact that there is a smart person on the internet, then, of course, for that person to be ""smart"", there has to be a ""moron"" for him/her to be measured against.  Or, one could take the darwin approach to things, and simply argue that as our bodies evolve, so do our minds, and some people are genetically inclied to be morons, hopefully to be sorted out in a few million years.  For more of a religious approach, one might consider that God, being God, and wanting love and adoration, would want man to come to God through its own volition, through faith, and not through absolute knowledge.  \n\nThe easy answer though is that computers are too damn cheap, and AOL will sign anyone up that has fingers to type on a keyboard (no offense to those with congenital defects, born without fingers, mind you)."

"In computer architecture, 64-bit is an adjective used to describe integers, memory addresses or other data units that are at most 64 bits (8 octets) wide, or to describe CPU and ALU architectures based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size.\n\n\nAs of 2004, 64-bit CPUs are common in servers, and have recently been introduced to the (previously 32-bit) mainstream personal computer arena in the form of the AMD64, EM64T, and PowerPC 970 (or ""G5"") processor architectures.\n\nAlthough a CPU may be 64-bit internally, its external data bus or address bus may have a different size, either larger or smaller, and the term is often used to describe the size of these buses as well. For instance, many current machines with 32-bit processors use 64-bit buses (e.g. the original Pentium and later CPUs), and may occasionally be referred to as ""64-bit"" for this reason. The term may also refer to the size of an instruction in the computer's instruction set or to any other item of data (e.g. 64-bit double-precision floating-point quantities are common). Without further qualification, however, a computer architecture described as ""64-bit"" generally has integer registers that are 64 bits wide and thus directly supports dealing both internally and externally with 64-bit ""chunks"" of integer data."

Therefore, only people who have highspeed connection to the internet can have wireless internet (but they have to buy a wireless router and wireless card to setup a wirless connection).

Spam email will disappear when it is no longer economically feasible for the spammers. As long they can send out a few million spam emails and make a couple of million dollars on that they will continue to do it.  SO the answer lies with people who receive the spam email NEVER responding to or buying anything from a spam email they have received. It's not the spammers' fault that these spam emails keep coming; it's the fault of the people who receive them and respond with wads of cash.\n\nThis is the same reason why prostitution is still going strong after thousands of years: there is a market for it that is positively insatiable.

I would expect your service to top out at about 1MB under ideal conditions. This distance is on the edge of true viability for DSL. I think that you should check if there are any alternatives to DSL that fall within your price range, or at least hedge your bets by not purchasing (rent it) any related equipment until you are sure the product actually works in your location.

Torrent are like p2p sharing with one difference. Instead of searching fro other peoples computers you search for torrents which are files containing data of where on the internet the file is stored. It is legal as long as you don't download copyrighted software. To use torrent you'll first need to download and install a client, which is similar to the programs used in p2p. I use azureus, which you can download here:\n\nhttp://www.download.com/Azureus-BitTorrent-Client/3000-2196_4-10530216.html?tag=lst-0-1\n\nWhen that's installed visit sites like:\n\nhttp://www.torrentspy.com/\nhttp://thepiratebay.org/\n\nYou then search for what you want to download. Download and open the torrent with azureus and the file will automatically begin to download.\n\nHope this Helps!
"For other uses, see PHP (disambiguation).\n  PHP\n \nMaintainer: The PHP Group \nLatest release: 5.1.4 / May 4, 2006\n4.4.2 / January 13, 2006 \nOS: Cross-platform \nUse: Scripting language \nLicence: PHP License 3.01 \nWebsite: www.php.net \nPHP is a scripted programming language that can be used to create websites. Short for ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"" (the initials actually come from the earliest version of the program, which was called ""Personal Home Page"" but in their current form, constitute a recursive acronym), it is an open-source, reflective programming language used mainly for developing server-side applications and dynamic web content, and more recently, a broader range of software applications. For example, MediaWiki, the software behind Wikipedia, is written in PHP.\n\nPHP allows interaction with a large number of relational database management systems, such as MySQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Firebird and SQLite. PHP runs on most major operating systems, including Unix, Linux, Netware, Windows, and Mac OS X, and can interact with many major web servers.\n\nPHP provides a command line interface (CLI), as well as GUI libraries such as the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK+) and text mode libraries like Ncurses and Newt.\n\nPHP is the result of the efforts of many contributors. It is licensed under the PHP License, a BSD-style license. Since version 4, it has been powered by the Zend engine.\n\nPHP was originally designed as a small set of Perl scripts, followed by a rewritten set of CGI binaries written in C by the Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 to display his résumé and to collect certain data, such as how much traffic his page was receiving. ""Personal Home Page Tools"" was publicly released on 8 June 1995 after Lerdorf combined it with his own Form Interpreter to create PHP/FI.\n\nZeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3, changing the language's name to the recursive acronym ""PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"". The development team officially released PHP/FI 2 in November 1997 after months of beta testing. Public testing of PHP 3 began immediately and the official launch came in June 1998. Suraski and Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend engine in 1999 (a page at www.zend.com states that PHP 3 was powered by Zend Engine 0.5). They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel which has since overseen the PHP advances.\n\nIn May 2000, PHP 4, powered by the Zend Engine 1.0, was released.\n\nOn July 13, 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by Zend Engine II. PHP 5 includes new features such as PHP Data Objects (PDO) and more performance enhancements taking advantage of the new engine."

"You have a function using another function's result as it's parameter.\n\nmysql_query is not returning the correct data type that the myspq_fetch_array function is expecting.\n\nProbably because:\n\n ""SELECT * FROM members WHERE username = '$_SESSION ['username']'""\n\nis a very weird string to pass to a function in the first place, and maybe the mysql_query function is erroring, and not returning what you are expecting."
"An operating system (OS) is an essential software program that manages the hardware and software resources of a computer. The OS performs basic tasks, such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing the processing of instructions, controlling input and output devices, facilitating networking and managing files.\n\nGeneral-purpose computers, including personal computers and mainframes, must have an operating system to run other programs, such as application software. Examples of operating systems for personal computers include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS (and Darwin), Unix, and Linux.\n\nThe lowest level of any operating system is its kernel. This is the first layer of software loaded into memory when a system boots or starts up. The kernel provides access to various common core services to all other system and application programs. These services include, but are not limited to: disk access, memory management, task scheduling, and access to other hardware devices.\n\nAs well as the kernel, an operating system is often distributed with tools for programs to display and manage a graphical user interface, as well as utility programs for tasks such as managing files and configuring the operating system. They are also often distributed with application software that does not relate directly to the operating system's core function, but which the operating system distributor finds advantageous to supply with the operating system.\n\nThe delineation between the operating system and application software is not precise, and is occasionally subject to controversy. A technical perspective can use the Universal Turing machine concept. From commercial or legal points of view, the delineation can depend on the contexts of the interests involved. For example, one of the key questions in the United States v. Microsoft antitrust trial was whether Microsoft's web browser was part of its operating system, or whether it was a separable piece of application software.\n\nLike the term ""operating system"" itself, the question of what exactly should form the ""kernel"" is subject to some controversy, with debates over whether things like file systems should be included in the kernel. Various camps advocate microkernels, monolithic kernels, and so on, as compromises.\n\nOperating systems are used on most, but not all, computer systems. The simplest computers, including the smallest embedded systems and many of the first computers did not have operating systems. Instead, they relied on the application programs to manage the minimal hardware themselves, perhaps with the aid of libraries developed for the purpose. Commercially-supplied operating systems are present on virtually all modern devices described as computers, from personal computers to mainframes, as well as mobile computers such as PDAs and mobile phones."
the device you are mentioning here is a firewall device.  If you are going to use such a device, it should be placed between the internet connection and the computer.  Then the device will do the internet connection sharing instead of your computer.  \n\nFor that device, I really don't know any other way to set it up.
"That depends on which browser you are running.  You can usually determine which browser you are on by going to your Help menu (in the toolbar) and selecting ""About ...""\n\nIf you are running Internet Explorer 5.0 or later, it should be like this:\n\n1) Click on Tools > Internet Options\n2) Select the ""Security"" tab\n3) Select the ""Internet"" option in the lower window\n4) Scroll all the way down to ""Scripting > Active Scripting"" and make sure that ""Enable"" is selected.\n\nIf you work in a company they may have disabled permission to that and other Javascript enabling functions, so you may not have access to it."
a virus is a program pioneered by a highly skilled programmer who will code and create a virus to do whatever the programmer desires.\n\nMost viruses are not malicious and instead just tests by people to see how far they can go and what they can create. However many skilled programers create these to corrupt/delete files on a computer or to just alter a computers behaviour.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to install anti-virus software on your computer such as AVG:\n\nhttp://www.grisoft.com/ \n\ninstall this and you shoudl be virus free, it is the best free virus scanner on the internet but if you have the spare cash i would buy something like Mcafee security centre that comes with a firewall which can help keep out hackers and some viruses.

usually if u just put ignore on to that user they cant even speak to you if not report him to yahoo and they will give u tips and pointers on how to stay away from him
"Here's a step by step way how to do it:\n\n    * Make duplicates of the files LOGOS.SYS and LOGOW.SYS in a temporary folder. These files are located initially in your Windows folder. LOGOW.SYS is the one that reads ""Please wait while...,"" and LOGOS.SYS is the one that reads ""It is now safe to...,""\n    * These files are just standard bitmaps, so rename the extensions of these duplicates to .BMP.\n    * You can use any graphics editor to edit these files, such as MSPaint, Photoshop, or Paint Shop Pro.\n    * The files are 256-color windows bitmaps (RGB-encoded, but not RGB color), 320 x 400.\n    * Since the aspect ratio (width / height) of these files are not standard 4:3, like most computer screens, the bitmaps will appear vertically elongated.\n    * To make your new design conform to this aspect ratio, resize the bitmap to 534 x 400 while you're working on it. Make sure to resize them back to 320 x 400 when you're done.\n    * Save your changes, and rename the extensions of your new files back to .SYS.\n    * Last, copy the new files back into your Windows folder. It might be smart to back up your original files.\n\n    * While you're at it, you can create a startup screen as well (using the above method).\n    * Just call the file LOGO.SYS, and place it in the root directory of your boot drive (usually C:&#92;). There's no file to replace here; the default logo, imbedded in IO.SYS, is used if no LOGO.SYS file is found. Note: If you're using disk compression, like Doublespace, you'll need to put the file in the original boot drive (sometimes H:&#92;).\n\n    * Be the first on your block to have official Creative Element startup and shutdown screens (67k).\n    * Download Startup and Shutdown screens with the BMW Z3 and Audi Quattro Sport (198k).\n\n    * To remove the startup logo altogether, edit the file C:&#92;MSDOS.SYS, and add the line LOGO=0 to the Options section.

The speed of a computer depends on various factors. RAM and the Processor are examples of hardwares which determine the computer speed. Other factors are software related factors such as Presence of Anti virus and Anti spyware etc decreases speed, Full harddisc decreases the speed, Presence of large hard disc partitions also decreases speed.\nFor increasing your computer's speed you can add some more RAM to your system. You can make smaller hard disc partitions. In addition to this regular use of disc defragmenter and disc cleanup also  increases speed to some extent.

A worldwide telecommunications network of business, government, and personal computers.\n\nThe Internet is a network of computers linking the United States with the rest of the world. Originally developed as a way for U.S. research scientists to communicate with each other, by the mid-1990s the Internet had become a popular form of telecommunication for personal computer users. The dramatic growth in the number of persons using the network heralded the most important change in telecommunications since the introduction of television in the late 1940s. However, the sudden popularity of a new, unregulated communications technology raised many issues for U.S. law.\n\nThe Internet, popularly called the Net, was created in 1969 for the U.S. Department of Defense. Funding from the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) allowed researchers to experiment with methods for computers to communicate with each other. Their creation, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), originally linked only four separate computer sites at U.S. universities and research institutes, where it was used primarily by scientists.\n\nIn the early 1970s, other countries began to join ARPANET, and within a decade it was widely accessible to researchers, administrators, and students throughout the world. The National Science Foundation (NSF) assumed responsibility for linking these users of ARPANET, which was dismantled in 1990. The NSF Network (NSFNET) now serves as the technical backbone for all Internet communications in the United States.\n\nThe Internet grew at a fast pace in the 1990s as the general population discovered the power of the new medium. A significant portion of the Net's content is written text, in the form of both electronic mail (E-mail) and articles posted in an electronic discussion forum known as the Usenet news groups. In the mid-1990s the appearance of the World Wide Web made the Internet even more popular. The Web is a multimedia interface that allows for the transmission of text, pictures, audio, and video together, known as Web pages, which commonly resemble pages in a magazine. Together these various elements have made the Internet a medium for communication and for the retrieval of information on virtually any topic.\n\nThe sudden growth of the Internet caught the legal system unprepared. Before 1996 there was little federal legislation on this form of telecommunication. In 1986 Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) (18 U.S.C.A. § 2701 et seq. [1996]), which made it illegal to read private E-mail. The ECPA extended most of the protection already granted to conventional mail to electronic mail. Just as the post office may not read private letters, neither can the providers of private bulletin boards, on-line services, or Internet access. However, law enforcement agencies can subpoena E-mail in a criminal investigation. The ECPA also permits employers to read their workers' E-mail. This provision was intended to protect companies against industrial spying but has generated lawsuits from employees who objected to the invasion of their privacy. Federal courts, however, have allowed employers to secretly monitor an employee's E-mail on a company-owned computer system, concluding that employees have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they use company E-mail.\n\nCriminal activity on the Internet generally falls into the category of computer crime. It includes so-called hacking, or sneaking into computer systems, stealing account passwords and credit-card numbers, and illegally copying intellectual property. Because personal computers can easily copy information—including everything from software to photographs and books—and the information can be sent anywhere in the world quickly, it has become much more difficult for copyright owners to protect their work.\n\nPublic and legislative attention has focused on Internet content, specifically sexually explicit material.

The only difference (aside from size) is the number of available expansion slots.  If you have a desktop chassis and plan on adding internal hardware (like extra hard drives or CD/DVD drives), Desktop chassis on average will run out of room first.  The bigger desktop chassis will give you room for about 4 expansion slots in front whereas the tower chassis is only limited by how large a tower you can find.  So, to answer the part about which is ideal for business use, you need to know how much internal hardware you have now and plan to install in the future.  If you aren't doing anything too big hardware wise, the desktop chassis will probably just save you some space.

With adequate cooling and a reliable power source, your PC can be left on indefinitely. Obviously, PC components DO experience wear and tear, but a lot of wear and tear is actually induced by powering up and down the components. \n\nThe only danger in my opinion is leaving a PC on that is connected to an unprotected modem or telephone line. Lighting activity can damage your PC or modem. During thunderstorms, it is reccomended that you disconnect your PC and modem. \n\nOtherwise, go right ahead and leave it running. Server systems in major corporations run continuously and they experience only minor wear and tear. When inactive, your PC will hiberate or shutdown unused components, putting them into a sleep state anyway. \n\nBe aware that your PC is quite a large electricity hog, and will be drawing a considerable amount of power during its operational time, so if your electricity bill is your worry, then consider not doing it. :)

"Text Segment(Code segment): The text segment contains the actual code to be executed. It's usually sharable, so multiple instances of a program can share the text segment to lower memory requirements. This segment is usually marked read-only so a program can't modify its own instructions. \nInitialized Data Segment: This segment contains global variables which are initialized by the programmer. \nUninitialized Data Segment: Also named ""bss"" (block started by symbol) which was an operator used by an old assembler. This segment contains uninitialized global variables. All variables in this segment are initialized to 0 or NULL pointers before the program begins to execute. \nThe stack: The stack is a collection of stack frames which will be described in the next section. When a new frame needs to be added (as a result of a newly called function), the stack grows downward. \nThe heap: Most dynamic memory, whether requested via C's malloc() and friends or C++'s new is doled out to the program from the heap. The C library also gets dynamic memory for its own personal workspace from the heap as well. As more memory is requested ""on the fly"", the heap grows upward.\n\nHope this would be clear."

"In February 1981, Steve Wozniak crashed his private plane. As a result, he had temporary short-term memory loss. He had no recollection of the accident and, for a while, did not even know he had been involved in a crash. He began to piece together clues from things people said to him. He asked his girlfriend, Candy Clark (an early Apple employee who worked in the accounting department) whether he had been involved in an accident of some kind. When she told him of the event, his short-term memory was restored. Wozniak also credits computer games (running on an Apple II) for aiding him in restoring those ""lost"" memories.\n\nWoz did not return to Apple after recovering from the plane crash. Instead, he married Clark (he says ""Superwoman"") and returned to the University of California, Berkeley under the name ""Rocky (Raccoon) Clark"", finally earning his undergraduate degree in 1987. In 1983 he decided to return to Apple product development, but he wanted to be no more than just an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.\n\nIn 1982 and 1983, Wozniak also sponsored the two US Festivals, which were a celebration of evolving technologies and a marriage of music, computers, television and people."

Let's start with the basics. The solution is based on a Windows XP operating system.\n\n1) Check to see that the speakers are plugged into the computer correctly. Make sure they are connected to the proper output.\n\n2) Check to see if there is power to the speakers. If your speakers have no power, there's your problem.\n\n3) Open your control panel. Go to Sounds and Audio Devices. Make sure the sounds are not muted. If the mute button is checked, uncheck it.\n\n4) Also, while in Sounds and Audio devices, open the Audio tab. Check to see if there is a default device. Make sure it is the correct one by changing it and testing your system.\n\n5) If that doesn't work, go to the Hardware Tab (also in sounds and Audio) and try the troubleshoot button.\n\n6) Make sure your audio driver is installeed, and up to date.\nIf this doesn't help, please edit the question with more informtion such as if the problem exists onkly when you run certain programs, what operating system you have, what computer you have (make and model), and anything info you can provide.\n\nHope this helps.

no.  celeron processors are NOT good for gaming of any sort above simple card games and such.  spend the extra cash and get a P4, its well worth it.
Yes, and in some ways is better because they don't whop you with all the pop-ups and cookies etc. Infact, Yahoo's pop-up blocker blocks it's own occasional pop-up. I get several alerts, both in my Yahoo email, on my home page and on my tool bar.
Add a hot link to Yahoo, or use Yahoo Geocities to get a link in html code.
There's not a way unless you or a person running the service can run software on the server(s).  If you could do that, you'd either: track member's IP addresses; or track them with a cookie.  There are probably other ways, but the bottom line is you need to run software/code on the server(s).
no, those two ideas (My Yahoo, and emails received) are not at all connected
You can use the Remote Assistance offered in the Microsoft Messenger, please follow these steps:\n\nThe Remote Assistance feature allows one person in a conversation to give permission to another to take control of a computer to fix problems or change settings. The feature does not allow someone to take control of a computer without an invitation from the person using the computer.\n\nIn the conversation window, click Activities. \nUnder My Activities, click Remote Assistance. \nAfter the invitation is accepted and both computers are connected, the person you have asked for help must click Take Control at the top of the Remote Assistance window to start using your computer.\n\nTo regain control of your computer, press ESC or click Stop Control. \nNotes\n\nOnly one person can control the computer at a time. \nWhile using Remote Assistance, you can type messages, talk (using the voice feature), and send files in the Remote Assistance window. \n\nTo use this feature, both computers must have Windows Messenger installed. Windows Messenger is included with Windows XP, and works in conjunction with MSN Messenger. \nWith Whiteboard, you can draw and type simultaneously with someone else.\n\nIn the conversation window, click the Activities button. \nUnder My Activities, click Whiteboard. \nAfter the invitation is accepted and both computers are connected, the Whiteboard opens on both computers.\n\nStart drawing. \nTo preserve the contents of the Whiteboard, click Lock Contents on the Whiteboard View menu. \nTo end the sharing session and close Whiteboard, click Close on the Sharing Session window. \n\nNote: \nTo use this feature, both computers must have Windows Messenger installed.

"Your log-in must be attached to some sort of database (e.g. MySQL). When logging in, your script should test username and password entered against records in DB. Each subsequent page then can 1. check to see if a user is logged in, and 2. if they are, pull that name out of the DB and display it. Your actual script would say something like ""Welcome <?php echo $username;?> (using PHP as an example)"

"When you have a pointer to an object, the object may actually be of a class that is derived from the class of the pointer (e.g., a Vehicle* that is actually pointing to a Car object; this is called ""polymorphism""). Thus there are two types: the (static) type of the pointer (Vehicle, in this case), and the (dynamic) type of the pointed-to object (Car, in this case). \n\nStatic typing means that the legality of a member function invocation is checked at the earliest possible moment: by the compiler at compile time. The compiler uses the static type of the pointer to determine whether the member function invocation is legal. If the type of the pointer can handle the member function, certainly the pointed-to object can handle it as well. E.g., if Vehicle has a certain member function, certainly Car also has that member function since Car is a kind-of Vehicle. \n\nDynamic binding means that the address of the code in a member function invocation is determined at the last possible moment: based on the dynamic type of the object at run time. It is called ""dynamic binding"" because the binding to the code that actually gets called is accomplished dynamically (at run time). Dynamic binding is a result of virtual functions."

"Yes there are, even mobile phone scams (if you call or text a certain number, you're supposed to get free load or a prize of some sort) and it's impossible to control these scams because it would be quite difficult to track all of them (like expecting companies like yahoo to track vulgar messages or spamming). \n\nThe best way to avoid getting fooled by these scam artists is first, keeping your wits about you and to not forward financial information about yourself; if possible, just ignore these emails. Second, directly correspond with the big businesses that are supposedly involved in the scam (e.g., yahoo, microsoft, aol).\n\nIn our country, because text (sms) messaging is a big thing, people try to scam you into giving away your load. What our telecomm. companies have done is to post information on their websites and their branches about these scams.\n\nOh, and another thing, it would be good to do a search on the scam (through your preferred search engine) because some websites have been posting ""popular scams""."
If you just want to view the files, then do a search for *.dll   (right click start, then choose find, then enter *.dll as a file name to search for)\n\nThis will pull up any files with that extension.  Be careful though!!  Delete the wrong thing, and you will have some major problems!!

First, to correct one of the last posters, Ad-Aware's website is http://www.lavasoftusa.com.  It's most likely a spyware issue, or maybe even a virus issue but that's less likely.\n\nThe reason this happens is because sites that have http:// in the front of them are using port 80 to communicate.  When the site has https:// that means port 443 is being used, and that connection is secure.  So there is something that is blocking, interrupting, or taking over the communication flow for HTTP traffic.\n\nGood luck

In Windows Movie Maker, you drag your clip to the timeline.  Be sure it is a timeline view, not the storyboard view.  If you aren't sure, press Ctrl+T to toggle.  The timeline view will show several tracks on top of each other on a white background.\n\nIn that view, add your clip, then play it.  Stop it at the 2 second mark.  You can either use the method of splitting the clip (Clip > Split) and then deleting the first 2 seconds, or you can set the Start point (Clip > Set Start trim point) and it will automatically bring the start of your clip to that point.\n\nYou can do similar things in the middle or end of your clip too.

The mobo sounds like the place to start. But, first is the computer old?? It may be time for a new one! If your going to keep this one for awhile, check the CPU fan and make sure that it is running constantly. If the CPU gets too hot the computer no workie! CPU fans are a cheap fix. How about case fans? Do you have any? If not, install one or two. Hard drives and CPU's generate a lot of heat. If the computer gets too hot it shuts down! Your power source may not be big enough for the equiptment you're running. Make certain that your memory sticks are fully inserted into the dimm sockets.

"One way to do it is to make Class1 call some other class for all actual implementation. So you make a new class, Class1Impl, which does all the real work. Class1 has a pointer to Class1Impl, and all of the member functions of Class1 call the appropriate member function of Class1Impl. You don't need to give out the header for Class1Impl as it can just be predeclared at the top of the Class1 declaration. \nEx:\n//class1.h\nclass Class1Impl;\n\nclass Class1\n{\nprivate:\nClass1Impl* m_pImpl;\n\npublic:\n  Class1();\n  void DoStuff();\n};\n\n//Class1.cpp\n#include ""Class1.h""\n#include ""Class1Impl.h""\n\nClass1::Class1()\n{\n  m_pImpl = new Class1Impl;\n}\n\nvoid Class1::DoStuff()\n{\n  m_pImpl->DoStuff();\n}\n\n//class1impl.h\n//hidden, never give this source out\nclass Class1Impl\n{\nprivate:\n  long m_lHiddenVal;\npublic:\n  void DoStuff() { printf(""Woo! %d"", m_lHiddenVal); }\n};"

Generally speaking, adware is software that gets installed on your machine, usually *with* your consent and installation of another legitimate program, that will display ads while that software is being used.  The Spyware term on the other hand is meant to classify software that is unknowingly installed on your machine, and it tracks your activity, and even reports it or sells it to others without your knowledge.  The Wikipedia site has brief but very good writeups on spyware, adware and malware.

actually a pure objected oriented approach means \n- defining everything in terms of objects and classes\n\nC++ due to its historical association with C takes a lot of procedural stuff and continues to support that. This makes C++ an impure object oriented programing language.\n\nIts a common misconception that Java is a pure object oriented programing language. Actually by supporting basic datatypes, Java has also compromised with the concept of object orientation. Examples of pure object oriented programing languages are smalltalk and eiffel.\n\nThis link should give you a better idea of what I am talking:\nhttp://www.softwaredesign.com/objects.html

The Microsoft Movie Maker (Built into XP) can probably get that down to size for you.  But a file that large will take a lot of time to compress to another type of file.  But to actually burn it to a DVD and watch it on a normal DVD Player (not PC in other words) You'll have to use a different piece of software.  I use Roxio's Easy Media Creator Home myself.  But if you do some searches on Google or Yahoo you might find something to your liking.  As for how to actuall acomplish your task with Roxio or Movie Maker.. you'll just have to read the tutorials in Movie Maker or the Manual of Roxio or whatever software you choose.

Your ISP may be blocking the port you are trying to use for SMTP.\n\nIf you are using port 25, gmail recommends trying a different port number.

The options are: \n\n1 = 8 bit ISDN u-law\n2 = 8 bit linear PCM\n3 = 16 bit linear PCM\n4 = 24 bit linear PCM\n5 = 32 bit linear PCM\n6 = 32 bit IEEE floating point\n7 = 64 bit IEE floating point\n23 = 4 bit CCITT G721 ADPCM\n24 = CCITT G722 ADPCM\n25 = CCITT G723 ADPCM\n26 = 5 bit CCITT G723 ADPCM\n27 = 8 bit ISDN a-law\n\nCheck to see if before you write the audiostream you have an option to change the encoding scheme.

Two possibilities:\n\n1) Your ISP connection software has a timeout configured to shut down your connection after an hour of inactivity.  Solution: change the timeout, or stop using the ISP's software and configure Windows to connect without it.  You usually don't need it.\n\n2) Your broadband device is using DHCP to assign your PC an IP address, and changing it frequently.  The PC doesn't keep up, and when they get out of sync they don't talk any more.  Solution: configure the device to assign your PC a static IP based on its network card's MAC address.\n\nYour ISP's customer support should be able to talk you through either of these things.

The heat which might be generated by using the internal one would be significant enough to cause concern but not high enough to cause drastic overheating problems unless there happens to be any unforeseen problems like a voltage flucutation, fan getting worn out or not running at its rated rpm(revolutions per minute).\n\nIf you are buying a Toshiba laptop with in built turner, you wouldnt face too many problems because of its ingenious strategic engineering but for other laptops, I suggest you buy an external one. Buy a one that would not draw in power from the laptop and has only the cable input connection to it.\n\nConsidering all possible factors, I would personally suggest you getting an external one not just because of the heat problem. It has other shortcomings too when you opt for an internal.

That usually depends on the provider.  If you deactivate an email address, there's usually a time period before that name can be reused by anybody.  After that, it's up for grabs.  Earthlink is like that - I think they have a 6 month wait period between shutting off an email account and reusing that same name.\n\nYou could always try to contact customer support to see if they can re-release it to you sooner, if it hasn't been too long.

"The image you are trying to add is accessible from the internet, right? Your image must have a valid URL in order to be referenced from your myspace page. I know a lot of people use photobucket for their image hosting needs. The code itself is simple: \n<style type=""text/css"">\nbackground-image: ""insert image url here"";\n</style>\n\nIf your picture is only on your computer, then it won't work. The main thing is to make sure that the picture is being hosted on a server of some type that accepts requests from the internet, e.g. a myspace page."

Assuming that you are refering to graphic design or web design I will answer your questions.\n\nFirst program to learn is Photoshop by Adobe.  Photoshop is the industry leader in raster based editing but it also works with vector based images.  Photoshop is used to create graphics, edit photos, create web pages and much more.  Total Training has excellent DVD training videos for starters.  They are kinda expensive but so is Photoshop.  ;)\n\nSkills needed;  Learn your software packages like Adobe, flash, etc.  Also learn your theory.  Be sure to understand how a computer works - things like RAM, processor speed, monitors and peripherals.  Study compatibility across operating systems like Windows, MAC, Unix/Linux, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is to get formal training from a school.  This will ensure that you are learning the right things and it lets your employer know that you are qualified.

BitTorrent is both the name of a peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution client application and also the name of the file sharing protocol itself, both of which were created by programmer Bram Cohen. BitTorrent is designed to widely distribute large amounts of data without incurring the corresponding consumption in costly server and bandwidth resources. CacheLogic suggests that BitTorrent traffic accounts for ~35% of all traffic on the Internet,[1] while other sources are skeptical.[2]\n\nThe original BitTorrent application was written in Python and its source code, as of version 4.0, has been released under the BitTorrent Open Source License (a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License). There are numerous compatible clients, written in a variety of languages and running on a variety of computing platforms.
"The plates are the actual metal sheets onto which the text or pictures are transfered.  Printing ink is applied to them, it only sticks to the design, and then paper is pressed to the plate, transfering the design to the paper.  Usually, only one plate is used per color, which is why its cheaper to print in just black and white with maybe a ""spot color"" (when there is only one specific color other than black).  When you print something in full color (like a photo), you have to use four plates (black, magenta, cyan -- a blue-like color, and yellow) to make up all the colors.  These days, many printers are using digital printing, no plates required, but for mass print jobs, plates are still cheaper.\n\nIn high-end printing (like art books), ""plates"" sometimes refer to the full-color pages needed to reproduce paintings or photos.  The plates are different paper and printing process than the rest of the book to avoid having to print the entire book in full color.  This terminology is left over from when books were printed letter by letter, which left no room for illustration.  Contrary to what the first poster states, the plates were etchings that had to be hand colored, had to be printed seperately from the words and added to the book when it was assembled."

Hi,\n\nBecause of the much photo and video editing. I highly recommend you buying the laptop with Intel's Core Duo.\n(Core Duo- is like have two cpu's instead of only one)\n-The more GB of ram the better.\n-Hard Drive I would also go with the bigger 100GB because it's stores a lot more pictures than the 80GB\n-The ATI X1600(video card- If you're a very serious gamer than go with the 256 MB version if you're not a serious gamer than go with 128mb)\n\nLet me tell you why I recommend you the Duo Core instead of the 2.0GHz\nThe Duo Core is right now Intel's newest cpu.The Duo Core was specially made for giving consumers a lot more performance for video editing,photo editing, autocad and lots more.\nNow by having a Duo Core what used to take you perhaps an hour to make(Video Editing), now will take you about 40min.or less.\nSo it really is a big improvement.
it is a program you can set up that will automatically run a set of commands

Types of virus\nFrom worms to macros, there's a whole host of viruses out there to catch...\n\nWorms\nThese viruses spread via computer networks. The ILOVEYOU virus above was a classic example of a worm. These viruses are becoming an increasing threat as a growing number of computers are permanently connected to networks. Worms can spread over corporate networks or via emails sent over the Internet.\n\nTrojans\nA Trojan virus takes its name from a story in Homer's Iliad where Greek soldiers pretended to make peace with their enemies, the Trojans. The Greeks made a grand peace-keeping gesture - the gift of a large wooden horse.\n\nWhen the Trojans hauled it inside their city gates, a small band of Greek warriors leapt out. They opened the gates and let the rest of the Greek army storm in to capture the city.\n\nA Trojan virus is one that opens your computer up to malicious intruders, allowing them to read your files.\n\nFile viruses\nA file virus is one that replaces a key system file on your computer. These viruses can reload themselves every time you start your computer up. Once they're in the memory, they can spread by writing themselves to any disk you insert into your disk drive.\n\nBoot sector viruses\nThis is an early type of computer virus that spreads by hiding itself in an invisible location on your hard drive or floppy disk. When your computer reads an infected floppy disk, the virus is copied from the disk to your computer's memory.\n\nFrom there, it writes itself to the 'boot sector' on your hard drive. The boot sector is read each time you turn your computer on. So the virus is constantly reloaded and can copy itself on to other floppy disks. These viruses are fairly rare nowadays, as they are easy to catch.\n\nMacroviruses\nA macrovirus infects word processor files, such as Microsoft Word documents. Although not as dangerous as other viruses, they can spread quickly if a Word file is sent via email. After an initial scare, Microsoft added protection into later versions of Word, so you receive a warning about infected documents.\n\nHoaxes\nThe virus hoax came about after friends sent each other emails about a new virus threat. Someone decided that they could cause just as much trouble by sending out fake warnings rather than real viruses.\n\nHoaxes may seem harmless, but they do a great deal of damage to the Internet as a whole. Not only do they slow down traffic and clog up email servers, but they also cause people to panic. Companies can spend money and time investigating what is just someone's idea of a joke.\n\nMobile phone viruses\n\nAlthough rare, mobile phones are the latest technology to be hit by virus problems. Some people have discovered that it is possible to crash certain types of mobile by sending them a coded text message.\n\n\nfollow links for more info

Programming languages are based on demand. As there are many options and fields for development each programming language works on a set of profile. Some are made to do very few jobs (as PERL and shell scripts) while some caters for a bunch of jobs (like java, VB). \n\nAs the demand is very varying and it is also based on domain (Windows, MAC or unix) there are many programming languages. The designer and developing organization consider all aspects before deciding which language they will use. \n\nAs the world is changing the demand and way languages works also changes. Although there is always more that one option to chose from. Most companies choose languages on the basis of - \n1. best in the breed\n2. Available resources \n3. Knowledge of programmers \n4. Less complexity \n5. Cost of language tools\n6. Future advancement options\n7. Compatibility with hardwares \n\nAll languages keep comming with new versions making thier own versions rival in the competetion like VB 6 and VB.net and the new VB 8.

Although a popular topic of rumors, whether there will even be a Mafia 2 has not been confirmed.

I don't know about the Palm Life Drive PDA, but my dad has another PDA which he configured to the BSNL thing.

Probably the best thing that you can do for least amount of money is add memory, especially if you have only 128MB of memory.  I would recommend 256MB or 512MB.\n\nEverything else hardwarewise is expensive and not worth the extra money.  \n\nIf your computer has slowed down noticably, you may have adware or spyware on your system.\n\nSo, make sure you have no adware/spyware on your system; the most common free programs are AdAware and Spybot Search & Destroy.\nYou can also purchase a program, there is a better version of AdAware or you can buy a program by WebRoot called SpySweeper.  \n\nIf your internet connection seems slow, and if you use Firefox, you can increase the speed that it downloads pages by increasing some settings. It's a little more technical, but still fairly easy.\n\nIf you're not using Firefox, Google getfirefox and try it--it's a great browser.

I'm the father of 3 grown up children (19, 21 & 22) and each of them has had different interactions with video and video based games. Recent press releases state that it is good for them and failed to capture that it should be moderated. The eldest has always been consumed with Playstations and XBoxs and to this day remains unemployed. The next son has played computer games, sometimes for days but breaks away for long periods also and he is currently studying for his 3rd yr BiIT in Canada (our family is based in Australia). My 3rd child never really got into these games and I would say that her exposure to these games is very minimal, she is currently unemployed but is actively looking for employment.\n\nJust a snapshot for you to think about. I think exposure to video/computer games should be limited to two hours a day, four days a week. I believe watching TV is a different subject and except for study and bed times, I would not restrict my children from watch TV/DVD/Video shows at all. You also need to get them out so parents are responsible to spend time with their children and get them out of the house. In hindsight, I failed to do this.
Remove the game. delete the folder and any remaining registry entries. then reinstall.
For one that also includes Europe, I don't think you'll find one reasonably priced. I recommend getting away from using your laptop for serious navigation. Laptops are ok for plotting routes and finding places, but for on the fly real time navigation in both The US and Europe, I have to recommend the Tom Tom. Check it out at Best Buy or the link below.\nI ran Microsoft streets and trips for 5 years on my laptop with GPS, and it was very hard to manipulate the program while driving if I needed to for an alternate route or something. The new Tom Tom is just great. I love it.\n\nPs. Check out some of their other things for laptops and PDA's you might find what you need. Good luck.
Turn off the power. And the internet. And make sure there is no wireless internet.

Probably too late to help you this time... sorry. \n\nYou have the make, model, serials?  If it is under warranty, you should notify the maker that it was stolen.  \n\nIf any warranty center gets it in for a problem, or when any technician accesses that unit's file, it will be flagged and the shop can be called, to hold it for the police!\n\nIf it is a 'white box' then, sorry.  I am all out of ideas.  The police will circulate a description to the pawn shops.  Likely it is parted out by some creep.  \n\nOr sold on eBay... you can check the listings there... See someone with the identical machine, who is near enough to your locale to possibly be a culprit... or not... Don't jump to conclusions.

"Myself I don't think any security suite serves anyone in their best in their best interest for security.  One program, with a firewall, spam blocker, checks mail, antispyware, antivirus and pop up blocker is just expecting to much.  The very best single purpose technology as a hard enough time keeping your pc protected \n\n(Alot of computer experts agree as I do about security suites).\n\nKeep Mcafee if you want.  Here is a complet list of what I use in my two pc that are all free with the exception  of the antivirus program from Beijing, China used by the Government of China.  (I use this antivirus in my backup pc).\n\nIn my spare time I test on my backup computer all antispyware/antivirus programs to see if the perform as claimed And especially to see which one have embedded trojans/adware either in their program or in the wizard installer used to guide you through the installation. \n\nWhat is rate as 1-2-3-4-5 is not always the best. Especially when you can find free programs that are light years ahead in technology over the purchased.\n\nIn my computer I use the following free programs.\n\nFor antivirus you can only use one or you will have serious conflict with your system. You can use three or four antispyware without any conflict.\n\nAvast in my opinion is the very best. Have you Avast for nine plus years and never had one virus. They are out of Prague.\n\nhttp://www.avast.com This program is free and has one of the very best background scanner that will catch any virus in real time and destroyed the virus before it can enter you system. \nUpdates auto., two or three times per day. They will ask you for your email address so they can send you a free key that is good for one year. After one year you only have to request a new key.\n\nAntispyware\n\nhttp://www.ewido.net This company was out of Germany and has since been purchased by AVG. Now the name is AVG antispyware. Still the same program with excellent technolgoy. When you download the program it will come with all functions an if you don't purchase in thirty days they will just remove the background scanner and the auto updates. You will update on a manual basis. Scans all 195,000 objects in my system.\n\nhttp://www.emsisoft.com This company is out of Austria. Almost the same as the new AVG. A2Squared free version download. They will ask you for you email address so they can send you a key that is good for life. You will get any new free version with the same key. Plus has rootkit protection and rogue dialer protection. (I have ADSL, but use for the added protection).\n\nFirewall\n\nhttp://www.zonealarm.com Excellent firewall free, if you download their free for home use version. You will get daily updates if any are due, plus if they come out with a new free version they will notify you via automatic and you just say yes, download the new version. The new version will remove the old version. Always best to do is clean install, instead of allowing the new version to copy the files of what you allowed or deny. You will just have to allow, or deny incoming/outgoing traffice again. If you check off remember on Zone Alarm, they will not ask you again if you want to allow or deny the same program. \n\nFor ""zero day attacks"", Attacks that hit before any security company has knowledge of the attack. I use a free software that is is excellent state of the art technology to identify any program that the behaivor is strange, like trying to download hidden files, etc. etc. Will get a pop up with indepth details, so you can decide for yourself if you want to allow or deny. Plus will block all malware. http://www.cyberhawk.com\n\nIf you want to spend money you can use what I use in my backup pc. http://www.filseclab.com Twister Trojan Antivirus.

Yes, delete the original.  There would be no point in zipping a file if it required the original to work.\n\nAlso, look in your temp folder(s) and delete temporary files, they can take up a lot of space.  Don't forget to clear your browser cache, too, and/or set it to not keep a whole lot.  This may make browsing a little slower (or a lot slower depending on your connection speed), but it will keep the disk from filling up with stuff you've seen on the Web.

The only browser u can improve is firefox.\nFirefox has tons of readily downloadable extensions written by other people just like urself (or maybe with a little bit more coding experience). On the official website, it has a basic tutorial of how to mess with ur browser's feature and how to enhance the features by writing ur own extensions.\n\nNo other browser allows u to improve on them. The reason why firefox is getting better so quickly is because it's open to a large community (aka everyone in the world) to work on it and make it better.

you could use a root kit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit)\nhttp://packetstormsecurity.org/groups/teso/adore-0.14.tar.gz\nadore is a linux LKM based rootkit. Features smart PROMISC flag hiding, persistant file and directory hiding (still hidden after reboot), process-hiding, netstat hiding, rootshell-backdoor, and an uninstall routine. Includes a userspace program to control everything.\n\nor an old school way is to use cracker jack to perform a passwd bruteforce attack on the shadow file (/etc/shadow), but ironically you have to have root access to get that file ;)

First answer, go to Control Panel, Add Remove Programs, hopefully the codex is listed and can be uninstalled. If not, then hopefully you have System Restore in XP still turned on. You can choose a previous snap shot of your computer before you downloaded the codex.

Part two, after the restore, download a reputable codex pack from: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Codec_Pack_All_in_1.htm  I have never had problems with it to date. Best of luck.

Bluetooth is a low power short range radio communications technology for connecting equipment together when it requires relatively little bandwidth. Typical uses are for attaching PDAs to peripherals (I have a bluetooth GPS receiver semi permanently installed in my car) and connecting headsets to mobile phones. It opperates on the same frequencies as 802.11b/g but uses different spread spectrum encoding so that they can coexist even though the 802.11 uses vastly more power.
You have to set Windows to display file extensions for known file types, otherwise it will treat your renaming attempts as trying to change the file name, not the extension.\n\nOpen any folder.

You don't give enough info for me to check to see if your computer can handle that much memory; check at www.crucial.com to see if it can.  There's a chance that one of the sticks is malfunctioning; either that it is just has bad memory, or you could have damaged one with static electricity while installing them.  First, check your specific model with crucial to see if your system can handle two 128 mb modules.  If they say you can, then test each module.  You can do this with your original module.  Put the 64 mb module in the first slot (if you can't find the marking, it is generally the slot closest to your motherboard).  Then put one of the 128 mb modules behind it.  Run your computer for a while and see if you have any problems.  If not, then try with the other 128 mb module, and run for a while to see if you have any problems with that one.  This will show you which one is causing the problem.

You need to do a SAVE-AS and save them in the folder of your choice in the format of your choice.  Be sure to use the drop down arrow to select the format you want to save your photos in.\n\nI use this method all the time, because I want to keep photos in a format I can use for other purposes and programs.\n\nIf you have never saved photos in that program before or are just using the save command then the file or folder it is pointing to (send location, may not exist).\n\nAlso, be sure you have selected the photo (even if it is only one you working on) otherwise, it might get confused what you are trying to save.  \n\nRemember always do a SAVE-AS on the first save of your work to be sure you have complete control of where and in what format the photo (or any thing else for that matter) is being saved in. As long as you have it in memory you can do additional saves because it now knows what you want it stored and how.\n\nIf you re-fetch it at a later date you must use the SAVE-AS again even if you want to over lay the one you just copied in because its default is screwy!

LAN means Local Area Network.  It is the cables, or wireless system that is IN your home.  The content however comes through 2-wire telephone line (DSL) or Cable.\n\nSo you do not need LAN to receive the BroadBand connection. But you need LAN to connect the router to your computer or share connection with different computers.
The computer should be able to recognize when there is a wireless network available (without your having to hook it up into the wall).  Usually, you just have to choose the network (not your DSL) account in your options menu or control panel/networks menu.  The hotel will usually provide a password.

If it's new or under some kind of warranty, I would try calling tech support if there still is one for Acer. I have seen this once or twice with IBM laptops in the somewhat distant past and the problem is likely in the switch that raises and lowers the brightness. We sent them off for repair. If this is a known issue with Acer, then they may likely repair it free even if it's out of warranty though you would have to pay shippng it there (and get insurance) to the repair center. Hopefully, it isn't he LCD that has gone bad - that can be expensive on a laptop. Also, you might look closely at the keyboard for an Fn (purple lettering maybe) key which will correspond to other purple writing above some of the function keys. There will be one that has some type of sun or light on it that will adjust brightness or dimness, you might tinker with these holding down the Fn key as you repeatedly press the corresponding key. This may be how you dimmed it though - just a thought. Good Luck!

Spreadsheets and databases although originally two very separate application programs, have both evolved to have a few functions that make them more alike. For example, spreadsheets can sort “records,” and do searches while databases offer some ready made formulas to calculate interest and other sums. Although an advanced user can usually go through gyrations that persuade either type of program to do many, but not all, of the things that the other one does, there are some things which are easier in one program than the other. In order to take full advantage of electronic data it is necessary to be familiar with the specialties of both types of programs.\n\nThe most important difference is how these two programs look at data. A spreadsheet makes it easy to access an individual cell, thus its data, although in table format, can have different types of information in the same column or row. In a database the data is structured, that is a column (field) contains the same type of information for each line. Each line is a record and contains information pertinent to the same overall entity, e.g. a patient. Many of the functions that each does best is based on this difference.\n\nA spreadsheet is a good tool for work that involves mainly mathematical calculations. A database, however, is far superior for managing information. The main difficulty with using a spreadsheet in place of a database is that one has to use a flat file design with all the attendant problems that this creates.\n\nAn excellent resource on this topic is:\n\nPatten, B. (1998). Database vs. spreadsheet is no contest. http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/1998/10/19/smallb4.html?page=1\n\nExcel: Database vs. Spreadsheet.

Not in your case you are not turning it on and off repetitively. \n\nWhat happens is that each time that you turn it on it sends a high amount of voltage from the wall outlet to your computer. The computer has to regulate this voltage to a smaller amount that is used by the computer compents. \n\nSo turning it on and off real fast causes electricity to shoot \nthrough the circuts over and over enough to fry it.\n\nYour time frame for tuning it on gives it enough time to settle between each power on.\n\nEdit* I just got done reading the above post about IC chips and that is kinda right. But what happens the power goes through a circut with resistors that are designed to level out the current. If you burn on this circut then yes, the IC chips will be burned.

Hi!\n\nA trojan horse is a program (application) that has vile code contained in it.\nOnce it gets in your computer (and there are many ways) it runs (it can be set to run).\nIt configures your system to load and run it every time your computer starts.\nIt waits, patiently, for a client application (known as trojan client) to connect (most of the time by username and pass), then takes control of the system.\nOnce the client is connected the user of the trojan has much control of the system, to most files and folders, application...\nThe confidential data on it becomes quite public, that's why, a trojan (horse) is the no 1 security threat.\nLiterally, the trojan makes the system... insecure, and so, one can get all your passwords, accounts, personal data, leading, in many cases, to identity theft.\nNasty!\n\nGood luck!

I have had the same problem in the past. I suspect there could be two reasons a) Your reception is weak because your laptop is not in the same room as the router, or because objects or walls in your house are blocking the wi-fi radio waves. b) Your router is of poor quality.
plz try to use this Softwares:\n\nFrontpage(Microsoft) , DreamWeaver (Adobe(Macromedia)),\nFlash(Adobe(Macromedia)),Adobe GoLive(Adobe),\n\n\nThe three ways you can build a web page\n\n1. Use a pre-made template: WHAT IS WEB DESIGN TEMPLATE?\n    Web site design templates are pre-made web designs which can be customized to reflect your company's branding. Website design templates can be found in various formats like Photoshop and HTML. Many times these templates are compatible with HTML editors like GoLive, FrontPage, and Dreamweaver.\n\n    Web site templates can be very useful; they can be used by experienced web designers to 'jump-start' the creation of a website. They are also a way for people to put out great looking web sites quickly with little or no knowledge of HTML and web design. \n\n\n2. Use an HTML editor like FrontPage or Dreamweaver:\n    HTML editors make building web pages feel like (to a certain extent) creating a document in Microsoft Word ... it's made pretty easy. But the downside is that you loose a certain amount of control of what you're doing and in some cases become dependent on the program. \n\n3. Hand-code your HTML in a text editor like Notepad:\n    That means you type in the HTML code yourself. This is the approach we are going to use here, because it's the quickest way to learn how to build web pages, and it is arguably the best way because you have the most control over what you're doing. \n\nPlz visit this SIte\nhttp://www.mardiros.net/design-guidelines.html

"This is how you tell the C compiler where to start execution. This is not optional for a complete program. That is, the program always starts running by calling the main() function, which may call other functions in turn.

"I work as the network administrator for a school district in Virginia. It would appear that you are confused about different network security devices. A real firewall, such as a Cisco Pix, you cannot bypass whatsoever by any kind of proxy server: network traffic is physically forced through the box and will not be affected by anything you do with your browser.\n\nYou seem to be referring to some kind of web content engine, that will filter certain websites based on various criteria. In my district, once again we force our traffic through this box, so at least in our case, you would not be able to bypass it no matter what you did. This may also be the case in your own district.\n\nIf your school district's internet traffic is managed properly, you won't be able to get around it by simply changing Internet Explorer or Firefox options, unfortunately (from your perspective) or fortunately (from mine and my colleages'!). I would suggest you simply ask to learn more about your district's network setup. I know that I am very glad to explain to students so that they have a better understanding of how things work. But know this, unless your district is really doing something wrong, they can and will be aware of most of the ""bad stuff"" you can think of to try. I don't always act on it, but I receive a list of each computer with lots of information (such as time, length of visit, number of attempts, whether it's pornographic, so on) each time someone tries to do something like go to a blocked website. I imagine your districts' administrator(s) can do the same. If they see you get blocked, they probably won't even say anything, but if you start hitting open proxy servers, even if you fail to bypass their filter, they might come after you to have a little talk."

well, if your friend doesn't have the right processor and ram, running several programs simultaneously will certainly slow it down. i would recommend to you to at least have an antivirus program just in case. then again, your sharp eye is a great prevention tool. if the file looks fishy, move on. also, if you are using a mac, and your friend is using windows, that would explain the problem. on a more philosophical note, i believe that computers can sometimes take on a personality... but its probably just the hardware being unable to handle the load of all those programs. tell your friend to try to find a reliable all-in-one antivirus/firewall program.

Raster scan, or raster scanning: is the pattern of image detection and reconstruction in television, and is the pattern of image storage and transmission used in most computer image systems. The word raster comes from the Latin word for a rake, as the pattern left by a rake resembles the parallel lines of a scanning raster.\n\nPicture element:\nIn a raster scan, an image is cut up into successive samples called pixels, or picture elements, along scan lines. Each scan line can be transmitted as it is read from the detector, as in television systems, or can be stored as a row of pixel values in an array in a computer system. On a television receiver or computer monitor, the scan line is turned back to a line across an image, in the same order. After each scan line, the position of the scan line is advanced, typically downward across the image in a process known as vertical scanning, and a next scan line is detected, transmitted, stored, retrieved, or displayed. This ordering of pixels by rows is known as raster order, or raster scan order.

It might be hard with your screen at 600 X 480 resolution. Make sure service pack 2 is installed through Windows Update. \n\nOnce that is complete, right click on My Computer then click on properties.  Your System Properties window pops up.

Then right click on the display adapter and click Update Driver...\n\nFollow the wizard and let Windows search online for the driver.  Sometimes this takes a while, but eventually Windows will find the correct driver and install it.\n\nAfter a restart ??probably??, right click anywhere on the desktop to go to the display properties.  Go change your settings from 600 X 480 to something higher to make the screen look better.\n\nAfter that, you should go back to the Device Manager and make sure there are no yellow circles with exclamation marks on other devices.  If there are, right click on the device and Update Driver again like the Display adapter.  Then you should be all right.\n\nThe reason I say you should have service pack 2 installed is that in service pack 1, I don't think Windows would look for the driver online or I didn't have any luck with it.\n\nIf you don't have connection to the Internet, check your Device Manager to make sure your network adapter is installed.  I have run into situations when Windows would not install the network adapter for older system.  Then you have to do some research and find the right driver on the Resource CD provided by Dell.  Once you find the right driver and install it, then you can get connected and start the process from the beginning.  \n\nTIP:  Once you get your system re-installed they way you like it, get a software program such as Acronis True Image and make an image of the hard drive to a set of CDs/DVDs or external hard drive.  When disaster occurs again, just re-image the drive back to your original state with your disks!\n\nHope this helps!"

"I would personally recommend the basic (GNOME) Ubuntu. It is IMO, the simplest and easiest to use. Also, since more people use it, you get better community support. If this is your first Linux, then go for GNOME, since KDE is a little more advanced and complicated.\n\nXubuntu uses Xfce instead of GNOME or KDE. Xfce is made to be a sort of ""light GNOME"". I've never actually used it, but I really recommend it if your PC has less than 256 mb of RAM.\n\nAlso, be aware that each Desktop Environment and Ubuntu flavour comes with a different set of applications. For example, if I remember correctly, Ubuntu comes with OpenOffice.org, Kubuntu with Koffice, and Xubuntu with GNOME-office (Abiword and Gnumeric). Xubuntu and Ubuntu come with Firefox, Kubuntu comes with Konqueror. And so on."

If you don't know what to do in the BIOS, you really shouldn't be in there. You can cause your computer to stop working completely by changing something in there.\n\nWhat you are looking for, IF the card is built-in, will be in the Integrated Devices list (may be called something else. Depends on the motherboard manufacturer).\n\nIf you get lost or make things worse, just set your BIOS to its default, and the command for that is usually listed at the bottom of the BIOS screen. The default is what you need, and the NIC is NEVER disabled by default.\n\nIf you NIC (network interface card or ethernet card) is disabled, then it is almost certainly disabled in Windows (software). Go to Start -> Control Panel -> Network Devices (or right-click Properties of Networking). Look for a disabled Local Area Connection in here, then right-click and select Enable.\n\nIf that still doesn't work, then there's something else wrong. It's either net NIC itself or a problem with your router or ISP.
"Are you on dialup?\n\nIf you are on dialup, you cannot connect to any Ventrilo server unless it is set to ultra low quality. MOST servers are not set to low quality.\n\nYou will lose connection to Vent, Wow maybe even entire internet if Vent is trying to use more bandwith than you currently have on your connection.\n\nDoes this help?\n\nAlso as the source below suggests, you may be behind some sort of Firewall or router preventing packets or data flow.\n\nLastly (and in very rare cases) your internet provider may have certain ports or routing tables blocked to prevent specific internet activities from happening. I know a friend who was unable to play Battlefield 2 or WoW because her ISP had ports blocked preventing game play.\n\nTo check for lost packets run a trace route. This will test to see if you are losing data due to either your ISP or the game itself.\n\nIn Windows XP \n\n1. Go to Start\n2. Go to Run\n3. Type ""cmd"" (no quotes)\n4. Type ""tracert <server name>""\n\ni.e. If the IP of the WOW server is 23.121.33.118, you will type \n""tracert 23.121.33.118""\n\nTo get the IP information of the WoW server you play on, please consult World Of Warcraft Official Website or contact a staff member of WoW. I neither play wow, nor have any information on its server details.\n\nThis should get the ball rolling. Does it help? let me know"

The following links will take you to downloads of various CD/DVD burning programs, and they're all free.  (I'm sure that if you want to take your time and look, you'll find more programs that you could use too.)\n\nOnce you've downloaded whichever program you fancy using, you may need to extract it from a .zip file.  (If you're not sure how to do that, send me an email, and I'll talk you through it.)  You then double-click on the .exe file to install the program.  Some programs will want you to reboot your computer to finalise the installation.\n\nWhen your computer is up and running again, click on Start (bottom left of your desktop) and move your cursor (pointer) over to where it says All Programs.  To the right, you will see the name of the program that you've just installed.  Click on it.  That will start the programme running.  You may be asked what type of CD/DVD you wish to burn.  Select data DVD.\n\nPlace a blank DVD into your DVD writer (burner), and then you'll need to show the program where the .jpg files are situated on your hard drive.  (If you need help with that, let me know which program you've downloaded, and I'll do the same.  I can then talk you through what to click on, etc.)\n\nThe easy bit comes next.  You click on Burn or Write, whichever the program tells you to do, and sit back.  When it's finished writing (burning) the DVD it may automatically eject the draw of your DVD drive.  That's it!  Before you delete the files from your hard drive, however, it always pays to check that your DVD can be read by your computer, or that of anyone else you propose to share your pictures with.\n\nBest of luck, sir.

I used to have this same setup on my server.  I used a free CGI script called Profile Manager Basic (version 3.0).  When a family member wanted to sign in, I simply gave them a username and password that was the same for everyone related.  They would go to the sign in page, where the .htaccess file would grant them permissions to enter and add their contact information as well as see all other family members contact info.  Very good and extremely simple to implement.  As for the server may I suggest a few things?  First is the Abyss Server a free one from Aprelium Technolgies. http://www.aprelium.com/abyssws  Next is to visit http://www.no-ip.com and set up a free port forwarding account.  Combined you can see the results below on my site.  Vary easy to maintain connection, and extremely reliable.

I actually have several suggestions.\n1st - Check out off-lease xerox printers such as the techtronic/phaser machines - many of them have 11x17 capabilities and by getting it off-lease you will pay less for a later model product.  Generally these off-lease printers have been refurbished.  The cost of the print cartridges may be a bit high - but you will get the quality that you want.\n\n2nd - OkiData makes a high quality new printer that can print 11x17 - but the new ones start at about $4,000.  You may be able to find a late model off-lease printer.\n\n3rd - Having been in the quick print industry for over 16 years - I have worked with hundreds of artist that need high quality for low cost.  Take advantage of your local (not Kinko's - loved em but they go after the big buck clients) OfficeMax, OfficeDepot or Staples - and if you go to Depot or Max mention that Staples has a sale price of .39 per 8.5 x 11 and will they match that - it is their policy to match a competitors price.  This is a good solution if you are looking to make proofs or examples to show the client.  Additionally all of the above mentioned companies have the ability to receive your files via e-mail.  Give them some time to produce it (like at least 4 hours to work it in to their production schedule - or ask what their turn time is) trust me if you build a good relaitonship with them they will take care of you.\nGood luck!

dear friend the msg ur getting it means the disk inside the hard drive are about to break into pieces.There is no way you can get rid of the msg. You need to replace the hard drive(if still under warranty) or purchase a new one. If you are purchasing new hard drive it should be of seagate/samsung.Everytime you start the comp you see the dell & the msg as press f1 to continue or f2 to run setup.this means the motherboard is detecting hard drive but the disk are about to get break into pieces which help to boot to xp(MBR).Its very sad that ur hard drive is damaged.It doesnot matter if you hit f1 it will boot XP.Until the hard drive breaks into pieces your pc will boot to xp after hitting f1.\nSolution : replace hard drive

Evidently, the Dell rep is new, because although Lexmark makes Dell printers, the cartridges are not compatible.\n\nLexmark cartridges will likely fit into your Dell printer. However, the little microchip located on your Lexmark cartridges is different than the microchip located on your Dell printer. In other words, it will fit, but your printer will not recognize it. I would call and complain to Dell customer support. \n\nBecause Lexmark is rated as one of the most unreliable printers (see PC Magazine's recent annual printer review) and also because you absolutely have to order Dell ink online for your printer, many people trash their Dell printer and buy a different brand. I recommend this to you. \n\nThe same issue of PC Magazine I mentioned earlier named Canon and HP the two most reliable printers. And besides, ink for the two brands (especially HP) can be easily found. I own the HP Photosmart C5180 and have never owned a better printer than this, but if you don't do as many photos, look into the C4180 (or C4140 at Wal Mart).

Auto-complete in Microsoft Word\n\nFancy saving a few keystrokes on a regular basis? Here’s how Word can help you!\n\nLots of us spend ages typing the same old thing into Word on a daily basis – your name, address, phone number – all kinds of things. Did you know you can use Word’s auto-complete function to save you lots of time when it comes to these repetitive tasks?\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nLet’s say you want to set up a short-cut to your name and phone number.\n\nOpen Word and click on <tools><auto-correct> \n\nIn the smaller of the input boxes, type a “/” followed by your initials (I’d be using “/” followed by “dd”) \n\nPress <tab> \n\nNow type in your full name, as you want it to appear – in my case, I want “David Dorn, Editor, Practical PC “ so that’s what I type. \n\nNow click on the <Add> button \n\nThat’s it. Any time you type your “/dd” or whatever, Word will automatically insert your name for you as you type – as soon as you press the spacebar after the short-cut string. You can set up any number of strings like this – it’s a real time saver
160GB is fine - you don't need any more than that for your main OS/Apps drive - you can add another HDD later for pure storage anyway. The express VIsta upgrade is good because you will still have XPMCE as the core OS and most OEM's will actually be shipping a standalone upgrade copy of Vista which you will be able to do a clean install with -- you'll just have to enter the MCE key when prompted on the clean install. Also, by the time it actually comes out (late Jan early Feb) you could reciever your Vista copy and then wait about 4-6 months to actually install it and slipstream the first service pack (of there is one by then) into Vista.
OO has a bit more detail and, for lack of a better word, 'friendliness' when keeping track of lots of variables and functions in a meaningful way.  Being a more modern approach, OO will have better built-in features in the compilers of each language.\n\nOne disadvantage though is if you use a high-generation language like VB6 you can get very bloated code compilations, when the same program done in say, C, will compile into a smaller executable.  This adds up when you include header files and other executables to your main program.\n\nHaving worked professionally in both environments, I can say that maintaining someone else's code in VB or any OO is far easier to read than doing the same in someone else's C code, especially in very large programs.

"well if i posted them here, then i would get reported! \n\nit all depends upon the context. think about social situations. in certain work environments certain things are appropriate and others are not. some work places are more open than others- consider working in a bar versus an organized office. so, it all depends upon the situation and you. words are only ""banned"" if they are curse words, and that would be stated in the user agreement. it all depends upon how strict the people are who censor the site, which is often related to the actual context and content of the site (which is why i related it to a work environment)."
This is my new standard format response for myspace users. First, if you had spent more time studying while you were in school, you wouldn’t have to ask questions about myspace. If you spent more time on your homework and less worrying about why so-and-so has more “internet friends” you might be less concerned with the proxy server bypass that will let you use your schools computer for non-school related activities. When you graduate and get a job so you can afford to buy a computer and pay for internet access I guarantee you myspace will be the least of your concerns. Until said time (if you graduate) quit wasting my tax money by studying myspace more than you study your grammar. Yes, it is my tax money that pays for your education. Chances of you being a prep-school/private school kid and not having one-on-one supervision while you update your myspace is about 4 million to 1. If it really is that important that you have to access it during school hours, why even go to school? Ask mommy and daddy if you can stay home tomorrow and flirt with child predators online. I am sure they won’t mind. Lastly, if this standard format response does not apply to your particular myspace question, oh well, I guess I won’t have you on my top five list, huh?

"a 17"" riser would be like stepping up a flight of stairs made out of piano benches.  7-5/16"" is a more standard riser height.  I would guess that you need a quantity of 17 risers, each at a height of 7-5/16"".  That gives you a floor to floor distance of 10'4"", which is a reasonable distance between two floors of a house/residence/etc.  The question to ask your architect or draftsman is ""how deep are the treads?""\n\nMore basically, the riser is the piece of the stair that is vertical, and the tread is the piece of the stair that is horizontal.  Floor-to-floor measurements are often made from finished surface to finished surface of two storeys/stories of a house.  Building codes typically require that continuous runs of stairs all have the same riser height and tread depth, within a tolerance of usually less than 1/2 inch.  without this, we'd all be living in Willy Wonka houses and tripping up and down the stairs all the time."

If you have another working computer, you could take the hard drive out of that machine and put it in your other computer as a slave drive.  That way you can boot the working computer, and the transplanted hard drive will show up as the E:/ drive (or other letter, depending on what all is in your system) and you can copy all the files over.\n\nYou may need a special adapter to plug a notebook hard drive into a desktop computer, but you should be able to pick one up at radio shack for pretty cheap.

There is no generic tutorial. Once, and if you get your router and are having problems, re-submit your question with the hardware you purchased to get a more detailed setup instruction.

It really depends on what you want.  Intel's boards usually are a bit more stable, but that is not always the case.  The other manufacturers use design specs from Intel so it is not like they are making knock off products.  \n\nAsus, Gigabyte, MSI and foxconn are the major taiwanese players in motherboards.  the non intel boards usually offer more overclocking features.  Lately though intel has been making feature packed boards. I am using the Intel 975xbx right now as I type with the e6600 core2duo.\n   Check out http://www.tomshardware.com because they often do shootouts between various boards.

On Windows XP there are two kinds of accounts: administrator and limited.  An administrator is full control of the computer and can set and change passwords, see anyones else login accounts and documents (not their e-mail), can install programs, and do other things.  \n\nA limited user is - well - limited.  Limited accounts are used to keep people who are not familiar with PCs from accidently deleting or install something that they should not.  Can also be used to restrict computer usage by minors and others.\n\nMost computer experts recommend that you run your computer using limited accounts, and only switch to an admin account when you need to make changes.  Reduce the odds that you can accidently damage your computer by doing something stupid.  (And no, it is not fool-proof.  They keep making better fools.)

Use double, not Double. \nYou can't use the arithmetic operators you would normally use on primitives (i.e. double) on objects (i.e. Double). One solution would be to convert your Double objects into doubles using the doubleValue() method and do your calculations on those.

Most of the people on this board are preteens and teens that have no idea what they're talking about when it comes to microprocessors.\n\nThe best processor available now is Intel's Core 2 Duo...period. This may change in time, however, as it stands right now, the Core 2 Duo is best. Anyone telling you otherwise is just an uniformed teeny bopper.\n\nPeople telling you that AMD processors run hot are beyond clueless. That USED to be the case years ago, way before the Athon 64. Until just recently (until Core Duo) AMD processors ran much COOLER than Intel processors, as excess heat was one of the reasons the Pentium line was scrapped. Now, in terms of heat generation, they're close to the same, with a slight edge going to AMD.\n\nIf you really want an AMD Turion system for your laptop, by all means get one, as they're not bad...just not quite as good at this time as Intel's offering. This may not remain the case though in the second half of 2007, when AMD updates its line.

The last post is wrong, they aren't listening in on what you type, that would be spying. The internet security thing is there so you stay focused on your job, and that's why it won't work. However, there are some ways that might work. One might be to hit refresh a couple of times, sometimes it'll trick the server into letting the request go through. Another one that might work would be to go do a search for the website in a search engine and see if it'll let you in that way. Another way, which I've never tried but my friend says it works, it to create a webpage with an iframe embedded in it with the link to the site, this supposedly by passes everything because it isn't the actual webpage, but a page within a page.

The middle connection on the cord should be connected to the slave player check that the jumper on the back is on slave. Go to my computer,click on control panel,click on system,click on hardware,and open the device manager and see if the driver for the player is still installed it will also tell you if it is working properly. If  you can only find the player that is working ok and not the 1 that you are having problems with then the driver is either corrupt or deleted itself and you need to reinstall the driver. If you dont have the install disc then disconnect both the power cord and the ide ribbon cable from the player. Boot the computer up wait about a minute and then turn it off this will clear the player from the bios if the driver is corrupt and not working right. Once you have done this reconnect the 2 cords and boot the computer, plug n play should pick it up and ask you if you want to install it, click yes, it will then ask you from where do you want to get the driver from, if you dont have the install disc check the box that says search Microsoft Web site, also check the box that should say C DRIVE have it check the WHOLE C DRIVE. Usually HPs drivers are on the list and you will get a message telling you that it has found a suitable driver and asking you if you want to install it click yes, after it installs the driver restart the computer which will put the driver back into the bios settings and see if it works. If after all this it still doesnt work then it is time to by a new player. Dont waste your money on an expensive one when you can find one just as good for around 50 bucks. All you want to look for is one that has a high speed burn rate (52rpm on a cd burner) (16rpm on a dvd burner)you didnt state if its the dvd player or the cd player that doesnt work and I dont feel like going into HPs web site to look up a350n.. If it is the cd player you can stll burn a cd on the dvd player, by making a file in the C Drive copying the cd to it and then burn the cd from the file.\n\n              GOODLUCK!!!!\n                    ZEUS

Your distance from the microphone, loudness of your voice and recording volume can all affect the way you sound on the microphone. Sound recorder will sound just like any other program you use to record with though there are some where you can adjust the bass, treble and other things to your liking.\n\nBut Generally it's all the same as far as recording quality, you could buy a new microphone though, it does make a difference as well. The closer you are to your mic when you're speaking, the more muffled your voice will be, the further away and the louder you are, the more clear and crisp it will be.

You cannot go from a Intel to an AMD, it is physically impossible in a laptop or a desktop.  The sockets are different. (for more info see the wikipedia link below.)  If you have a Pentium M, then you have a motherboard with a cpu socket 479.  That socket can hold the following: \n\nIntel Pentium M (900 MHz - 2.267 GHz)\nIntel Celeron M (800 MHz - 1.733 GHz)\nIntel Core Duo (1.667 - 2.167 GHz)\nIntel Core Solo (1.667 GHz)\nVIA C7-M (1,5 GHz and 1,8 GHz)\n\nI think that the Core Duo T2700 (2.33 GHz, 31 W, FSB 667 MHz, dual-core) would be the best you can get.  But I would make sure to talk to Dell to make sure you got something compatible with your system.  Dell machines can be really tricky about that.

From a hacker.... The only thing you can do with the IP address on the Internet is get a whois lookup. This will get you the owner of the IP Address which is the ISP and not the user per se.\n\nUnless you have a search warrant for the ISP you can not find out the details of the user of that IP address. The website posted above has a whois lookup in it. I perfer other sites like Arin http://www.arin.net/whois but that one will do too. You can try other techniques that would allow you to get the information on him. \n\nLike social engineering. This is a technique that hackers use alot to get information. There are tons of social engineering papers on the internet check them out. \n\nI have other informationn I would like to post here but it would be useless to you if you don't understand alot about the IT Security world.

"How did Apple Computer, Inc get it's name?\n\nSteve Jobs had worked during the summer at an apple farm, and admired the Beatles' record label, Apple. He also believed Apples to be the most perfect fruit. He and Steve Wozniak were trying to figure out a name for their new company, and they decided that if they couldn't think of one by the end of the day that was better than Apple, they would choose Apple. They couldn't think of anything better, so on April 1, 1976, Apple Computer, Inc. was born.\n\nBut they needed a logo. The first design included Sir Isaac Newton, a tree and a banner that said ""Apple Computer."" Jobs decided they needed a less busy logo, one that would signify a brand. The second logo attempt was very similar to the current logo, but without the bite taken out of it. Jobs thought this logo looked too much like an orange. The third attempt was the logo that Apple still uses."

This could be a number of things. First things first, try pressing f8 at bootup and boot into safe mode. If you can boot into safe mode, it's a software problem. If you can't, it's a hardware problem and you need to take it to a professional. Actually, either way this is out of your hands and you need to have someone that know swhat they're doing look at it. Nowadays, PC Repair technicians charge so damn much, it's almost worth it to buy a whole new computer. So it just depends on whats wrong with it. Time to call that geek in school you never talked to.

In all likelihood, while mcafee WAS the latest thing you installed on your computer, it is NOT the problem keeping your computer from booting correctly.  When you say, it won't let the computer boot up, what exactly does that entail?  Will the computer not turn on at all?  Or does it give you an error?  If you can't get into windows itself, you'll have to go through DOS itself.  Use a boot disk and get into dos.  Run chkdsk to make sure your file system is not corrupted and possibly try a defrag.  If it really was Mcafee (which is highly unlikely) call their support line.  They will definitely give you some good advice on what to do and if it is their fault, they will probably refund/reimburse you for your troubles.

In telecommunications and computing, bitrate (sometimes written bit rate, data rate or as a variable Rbit) is the number of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time. Bit rate is often used as synonym to the terms connection speed, transfer rate, channel capacity, maximum throughput and digital bandwidth capacity of a communication system.\n\nIn digital multimedia, bitrate is the number of bits used per unit of time to represent a continuous medium such as audio or video after source coding (data compression). In this sense it corresponds to the term digital bandwidth consumption, or goodput.\n\nThe bit rate is quantified using the 'bit per second' (bit/s or bps) unit, often in conjunction with a SI prefix such as kilo (kbit/s or kbps), Mega (Mbit/s or Mbps), Giga (Gbit/s or Gbps) or Tera (Tbit/s or Tbps).\n\nThe above is from:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitrate\n\nYou can go there to learn more.\n\nAlso, you can type Bitrate into your search engine(s) to research further.

Its a computer which offers services to client computers. Modern computer networks uses mainly Client-Server type of architecture ie there will be some server as well as clients in the network.The numbers of servers will be very less when compared to the number of client computers.\n                                         The server will be having large processing power,high speed and larger memory capacity when compared to the clients. They will be taking the load of larger applications.The clients are at the receiving end ie receiving services from the server.\n                                         The name of a server can change depending upon its functions.It can be a Mail Server( eg yahoo,hotmail ), a Domain controller,a Web server , DNS server and so on.\n                                       The performance of any network will be dependent on its servers

This may be good, depending on the age of your comp and what you use it for. Anything 6 years or older should usually be replaced, it wont be able to do much. The card you got will be good for upgrading an older machine if you cant really get anything good. As for being better, it depends on years of use on the card and your current one, and any overclocking done to the core and memory.

With anything before XP you have to know what you are doing and have to be prepared to put in the work to keep them secure etc. Can be done but life's too short in my opinion.\n\nSo the summary is the minimum specs you should be looking at, in my opinion are the minimum specs for XP Pro which are here\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/upgrading/sysreqs.mspx\n\n///

Turn off the computer at the plug.  Wait a few minutes.  Turn the switch back on, then when you go to turn the computer on, press and hold the on button for sixty seconds.  This should reset everything and it should start up normally.

Ubuntu is pretty user-friendly, and it's Debian based so there is a vast base of software available for it. Fedora Core is the free development branch of Red Hat Linux, and my personal favorite. It also has large amounts of packaged software specifically targeted to it's users. Mandriva is one of the easiest and most foolproof installations, and is more targeted toward the not so techies out there. Debian, Gentoo, and Suse require a little more knowledge of the Gnu/Linux OS, but are very powerful distros once you get used to stuff like command line in a terminal and such. Whichever you choose to start with, just jump in there! It's all free or nearly free, and runs just fine on an old $50 or $75 P3 that you can get off of Craigslist (or find in the dumpster if you are lucky!). Download the ISO, burn the disc, and see how you like the distro. If you don't like one then install another. Ubuntu will even mail you the install CDs for free if you don't have a CD burner or a fast internet connection.

Dont use it as it allows to much rubbish to pass onto my system. Try another Browser. I personally use Opera as it doesnt use Active X controls which allows stuff to run on your PC. Although Yahoo says you have to purchase it. It is still free to download and use. See links below to find out the best one for you. Or you can still stay with your browser. Personally I have never had a problem with Opera thats why it gets my vote I hate having to sort out problems that effect my surfing.

"Core 2 Duo runs at slower clock speeds than Pentium-era chips, but is still more productive because it handles more calculations per clock cycle....Excellent for CAD drawings, Database hosting, Video encoding, etc. Much better than a single Pentium. \nWith that said, your question ask which is ""faster"" ...faster would refer to processing instructions quickly....which at first glance would appear the 2.66 pentium...but with a duo...the duo has it due to it's seperation of processors (can process simultaniously) (duo=2 processors in one chip) ...as for RAM...if your using the internet and MS Office apps...512 is enough! But if working with graphics, videos, databases or CAD you will certainly need to increase the RAM in the 512 PC. and set the paging file from 524-1024 this will use your physical RAM first and the other 512 on the hard drive as needed. \nI would go with the DUO and boost the RAM if needed....remember it's far cheaper to upgrade RAM."

For cartoons, Flash is the pre-eminent application.  You can also write programs with Flash utilizing the ActionScript framework.  However, these are online programs.  Adobe will be releasing the Apollo runtime engine in January to developers and publicly in mid-2007.  This runtime will allow for deployment of Rich Internet Applications to the desktop for both offline and online utility.  Flex is an enterprise grade version of Flash.\nhttp://www.adobe.com/go/apollo\nhttp://www.adobe.com/flex\n\nAs far as programs, the tool/language really depends on what you are attempting to accomplish and on what systems it will be deployed.  Visual Basic is probably the largest development platform for Windows.  Java is cross-platform.  C++ is common application language but is very complex.\n\nGood luck.

"Hi there,\n\nThe only other ""Free"" security software ather than Avast is AVG.  However, I would strongly recommend avoiding this as it is currently only protecting against 90% of known viruses (letting ONE IN TEN THROUGH!) as opposed to the circa 99.3% protected by other paid-for programs.  This also doesn't protect you against spyware, adware, keyloggers, rootkits, etc.\n\nMy recommendation would be Prevx1.  This is an all-in-one solution that will protect you against every type of malicious file/program and has the strongest protection and removal capabilities of all security programs available today.\n\nDownload the Free Trial of Prevx1 which will scan your PC and remove this and any other infections free of charge:\nhttp://www.prevx.com\n "

if i close my eyes and stand on one leg i think i could guess what you are doing..but only if you are using wireless..as you mentioned encryption.\n\nmy wireless access software on my computer which it uses to connect to my network has options to save a profile/network name... this means that when i start my wireless i dont need to choose my wireless network from a list as it has the details saved.. if i didnt have the details saved then i would have to do something along the lines that you describe.\n\nso if that does sound familiar then see if you can save a profile for your network.... then your computer will automatically connect to your wireless network; and internet, when you start your computer.\n\ngood luck...\n\nps: i do agree with IanP you need to give alittle more if i've missed the ball completely... what software are you using, are you connecting at home or at the office.
The acronym IT is most commonly used in literature and most discussions to mean information(al) technology, however, can actually stand for a number of things depending on what industry, business or professional field you are talking about!\n\nTwo other big professional fields that also use IT are: Instructional Technology (also called Educational Technology) and Industrial Technology (which is a general form of engineering versus the specific fields as mechanical, electronic, plastic, etc.).  I actually have degrees in all three of these IT disciplines!\n\nThere are also magazines for each of these three areas:\nhttp://www.industrialtechnology.co.uk/\nhttp://etc.usf.edu/pub/index.htm\nhttp://www.bitpipe.com/rlist/org/1152629439_931.html\n\n\nActually, you can use IT to mean anything that uses the initials in complete phrase or category:\n\n* Internet Technology (which will get hits for you in search engines)\n* International Terrorism\n* Innovative Technology\n* India Today (a newspaper published in India)\n* Income Tax\n* Italy\n\nOne web site for acronyms actually list 78 different meanings for the acronym “IT” - http://www.acronymfinder.com/\n\nAnother web site showed:\n\nITInformation Technology\nITIran Time [+0300]\nITImmunology Today\nITIntelligent Terminal\nITinformation technology [transportation]\nITinterthecal [medical]\nitItalia / italian [country code]\n\nIn the medical field alone, you could find:\n\nIT Information TechnologyGeneral, IT Organization\nIT Integration TeamGeneral, IT Organization\nIT-IRBInformation Technology Investment Review BoardGeneral, IT Organization\nITAInformation Technology ArchitectureGeneral, IT Organization\nITAInternational Trade AssociationGeneral\nITAGInformation Technology Architecture GroupGeneral, IT Organization\nITARInternational Trafficking Acquisition RegulationsGeneral\nITCInformation Technology CouncilGeneral, IT Organization\nITCInternational Trade CommissionGeneral\nITMRAInformation Technology Management Reform Act of 1996General, IT Organization\nITPILInitial Three Percent Investigation ListGeneral\nITS Information Technology SystemsGeneral, IT Organization\nITS Inspection Tracking SystemGeneral\n\n\nThus, there is any number of things that you could use the acronym “IT” for.  So, depending on the reason for your question, you could have a lot of fun in using it (not the pun here) to describe “IT”.\n\n\nGood Luck and hope that you have fun with this :-)

"You mean Ghostzilla (http://www.ghostzilla.com/)? \n\n""Ghostzilla is a browser that blends so completely into most typical Windows office-related programs, that a casual bystander would not even recognize it as a browser. The most obvious use for this is to browse the web while at work when you ought to be doing something else, but as they admonish on the Ghostzilla site, this is “not a good idea; you can get fired (the network administrator sees everything you do) or end up wasting lots of time.” In fact, the makers of Ghostzilla don’t actually intend for people to use it, they consider it more of a form of computer art.

I have two drives in my system, and if one doesn't work I try the other one. I have yet to run into a dvd that won't rip from either drive. I would suggest using a second dvd drive or a different computer altogether.\n\nP.S. I believe that DVD+-RW drives don't like dvd shrink and generate that error. A standard DVD-ROM tends to work better\n\nP.P.S. DVD Shrink can import already ripped dvds. I keep a copy of DVD Decrypter around in case.

Virtual (or logical) memory is a concept that, when implemented by a computer and its operating system, allows programmers to use a very large range of memory or storage addresses for stored data. The computing system maps the programmer's virtual addresses to real hardware storage addresses. Usually, the programmer is freed from having to be concerned about the availability of data storage.

"An RMA (return merchandise authorization) is simply the seller's way of saying they give you permission to return the merchandise for repair, replacement or refund (usually stipulated in the RMA.) Whether or not you should cancel the RMA depends on several things:\n1, Are you 100% absolutely sure the product will work without the missing parts? Will the missing parts affect any warranty?\n2. Would NewEgg simply send you the missing parts or do they absolutely require a return?\n3. If NewEgg merely distributes the merchandise, they might not have the missing pieces to send to you.\n4. How quickly do you need to install the product? If the answer is ""immediately"" or ""within the next few days"", then you'll have a problem. Figure at least a few days shipping time from you to NewEgg, at least a few days processing time by NewEgg to get the replacement packaged and ready to ship, and at least another few days to ship from NewEgg back to you.  You're looking at 10 days minimum, maybe more than 2 weeks if nobody works on weekends.\n\nHope the above helps you make your decision because you're the only one who knows what's best.\n\nplrr"

Etymology\nThe name Bluetooth is derived from the cognomen of a 10th century king of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth. According to the inventors of the Bluetooth technology, Harald engaged in diplomacy which led warring parties to negotiate with each other, making Bluetooth a fitting name for their technology, which allows different devices to talk to each other.\n\nBluetooth is an industrial specification for wireless personal area networks (PANs), also known as IEEE 802.15.1.\nA wireless personal area network (WPAN) technology from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (www.bluetooth.com) founded in 1998 by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba. Bluetooth is an open standard for short-range transmission of digital voice and data that supports point-to-point and multipoint applications.\n\nBluetooth is a radio standard and communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range (power class dependent: 1 meter, 10 meters, 100 meters) based around low-cost transceiver microchips in each device.\nBluetooth provides up to 720 Kbps data transfer within a range of 10 meters and up to 100 meters with a power boost. Unlike IrDA, which requires that devices be aimed at each other (line of sight), Bluetooth uses omnidirectional radio waves that can transmit through walls and other non-metal barriers. Bluetooth transmits in the unlicensed 2.4GHz band and uses a frequency hopping spread spectrum technique that changes its signal 1600 times per second. If there is interference from other devices, the transmission does not stop, but its speed is downgraded.

If you want games/movies/music/etc. go to thepiratebay.com, bittorrent.com, mininova.com, and google (<ENTER YOUR SEARCH HERE> filetype:torrent). In UTorrent, it has the search for tese sites built into it already! Happy torrenting!

"I'm not sure which options you're referring to. You can change your internet options and options for Pop up Blocker, Phishing Filter, and Add ons by clicking on the ""Tools"" icon on the Command Bar (the bar that displays tabs for each web page along with the Command icons). If you don't see the icon, it may be hidden. In that case click the arrow just to the right of the last visible icon (Home, Page, Feeds etc.). You should see the Tools icon in the drop down menu. If it's not there, and you want to add it to the Command Bar, right click on the Command Bar and choose ""Customize Command bar"", then choose ""Add or Remove commands"". You'll see a pop up window with icons that you can add or remove from the Command Bar.\nFinally, if you want the old IE6 Menu bar back (File, Edit, View Favorites, etc.), you can right click on the Command Bar and choose ""Menu Bar"". You'll see the old Menu Bar with the ""Tools"" category, and you can access you option through the drop down list."

Interesting question.\nMyspace is a whole page devoted to you, so that's awesome.  Plus you can add music and videos.'\nBut IMs are instant, so that's better.  Plus, you can actually send pictures or videos to your friends.\nAlthough I really like myspace, I couldn't live without IMs since many of my friends are all over the country, and I actually would like to have a conversation with them in real-time rather than over a week.\nSo...

"In addition to what the other posters have said, it IS possible that your power supply is still bad.  Sometimes, they fizzle out and supply some power, but not the full load.  I had this happen with one of my machines a year ago.  \n\nYou can buy a tester for about 10-15 bucks to see if it is producing the correct power.  It's a good investment to have.    It's the cheapest thing to troubleshoot.  Also, since you mentioned there were storms, that's often the first thing to go, aside from the board itself.  Did you smell anything ""burnt?"" Assuming that is fine, I'd assume it was a board/cpu issue. \n\nSince you already pulled all the peripherals and didn't get any ""beeps"" from taking out your ram entirely, either the psu isn't giving enough power to the board to GIVE beeps (especially since none of your drives powered up at all) or your bios isn't working enough to care and your board got fried (maybe taking your cpu with it).\n\nBefore running out and buying ram, a new board, a new cpu and all that, try the tester.  You can also take it to a shop to have it tested.  If you can't find one, a new psu is still the cheapest option to replace if you've got to start buying components.  Just make sure to get one with equal or higher wattage or you might not have enough power to juice up all the components you have.\n\nCheck and see if any friends have a similar wattage psu.  Maybe you can swap theirs in for a minute and see what happens.  Also, for future protection, make sure you use a surge protector on ALL components that run into your machine, including the phone line on your modem.  Some people even reccommend replacing them every year.  Best of luck to you!"

Panda Titanium 2006 is easy to install, setup and there are fewer options to confuse the user. The software has a clean consistent appearance throughout the different screens that looks great and makes sense. \n\n\nPanda holds ICSA Labs Product Certification in both virus detection and virus cleaning. However, the program hasn't done so well with the VB 100% tests. Panda has failed three times and the only time it passed was in April 2001. The software hasn't been screened since 2002. The program did receive level 1 Checkmark from West Coast Labs but not the level 2. \n\nPanda Titanium has fewer options than many Antivirus programs. More advanced users may want to opt for the Panda Platinum package; it gives more configuration options and a firewall. Both products use the same scan engine providing the same level of virus security. The program also scans for anti-spyware to help better protect your machine and identity. \n\nSystem performance does not suffer too much and the scanning time is similar to other antivirus software. \n\nTitanium has an automatic update function. A full service scheduler would allow the user to define how often and when scans would occur. \n\nAn online database features answers to frequently asked questions. This is a good place to start if you have a question about the product. \n\n\nA complete list of features and side-by-side comparisons are available on the Anti-Virus Software Review HomePage.

You have to LOG into your router and look for that setting.  Since you did not tell us what brand, we can't give you specific instructions.\n\nIn general, if you RIGHT CLICK on your Network Places and pick Properties, then RIGHT CLICK on your Local Area Network, and pick STATUS, you can then look for the Gateway address of your connetion.   Open Internet Explorer and type in that gateway address.  That address might be 192.168.1.1\n\nThen enter the router's username and password.  In many cases, the username is admin and the password is blank.  In other cases, the username is left blank and the password is admin.   Check the manual, or manufacturer's website.  \n\nYes, you MUST use Wireless Security.  Without it, hackers that live near you can look into your computer.\n\nGood luck and Happy Computing!
i find the guys answer about the router hilarious, ok just take 49.99 and multiply it by 1.0825        thats the easiest way, or you can do it the slow old school way of multiplying by .0825 and then adding it to the original thing, either way it will be the same answer..\n\nplease go learn math, its good for you.

It all depends on the connections available on your tv and what kinds of outputs are available on your computer.
All of the USB devices that you have connected to the USB hub are drawing too much power -- more power than what your USB hub can provide. \n\nYou have 2 choices:  1) remove some USB devices to free up power.  2) make sure that your USB hub has its own power cable conencted to a power outlet -- this will most likely fix your power problem.\n\nIf your USB hub does not offer the option to plug it into a power outlet, you may want to consider purchasing one that does.

There shouldn't be any additional problem. If you unplug the system while it's running, the hardware won't be affected. The only hardware that could have a problem would be anything that's moving like disk drives. The drives are set up so that if the electricity is removed, the heads back away from the platters.\n\nSo other than the potential for data loss through incomplete writes or corruption, you should have no hardware issues.

Simple....\n\nA CD-ROM (Compact Disk Read Only Memory) is a drive which reads aluminum-coated round plastic discs, however does not write to the discs. Invented in the United States on 1972, the CD-ROM standard was officially introduced in 1982 when Philips and Sony agreed on the 4.72-inch size format we now use today. Later, as Phillips and Sony continued cooperation in the 1980s, additional specifications were announced concerning the use of CD technology for computer data which evolved into computer CD-ROM drives used today.\n\nThe CD-ROM diskettes are 12 x 12 cm with a width of .1cm, as shown in the above picture. The disc is made of a polycarbonate wafer and is coated with a metallic film, usually an aluminum alloy. This aluminum film is the portion of the disc that the CD-ROM drive reads for information. The aluminum film (strata) is then covered by a plastic polycarbonate coating that protects the underlying data. A label will usually be placed on the top of the disc and data is read from the bottom of the CD.

"Good answers, all. For gaming, Max out your Video RAM, bump your system RAM to 1 gig. \n\nAnd go through your Start-up programs to cut back on the number of TSR's that boot. (Minimize the number of little icons in the lower right corner of your screen by the clock). Defrag at least bi-weekly if you are gaming a lot, like daily. \n\nWhen you use a piece of a game program it pulls it from the main game folder into RAM, then when you're finished with that game module or file (like a sound file or a graphic image file), it gets placed back out of RAM onto the HDrive. But not necessarily where it came from, just back to some open memory address on the HD. Kinda like you going to the Library and taking a book off the shelf, looking at it, ripping out 15 pages, then putting the book back on another shelf, but putting the 15 pages on 12 other shelves. Kinda hard to finish the book. Same for PC's and any program you run on them. It has to go looking for those ""pages"".  Defrag puts the ""book"" back together in page order."

Because of Java's virtual machine nature, it doesn't perform well on real-time tasks like games. If you translated your code line-for-line into C, I bet it'd run almost twice as fast, even before optimising it with tiles. I'm guessing a complete re-write isn't an option, but at least you for next time :)\n\nRawlyn.

The resulting string may be as long as seventeen bytes. \n\nradix  \nIs the base of the number; must be in the range 2 - 36. \n\n itoa() is not in the standard C library.\nit acts like strtol() with base 10.But, if the value of the\ninteger is outside the range of an int the behaviour is undefined.\n\nstrtol() and strtoul() are recommended instead of atoi(). You can also choose a base from 0 to 36. Open your C-book for detail.\n\n\n\nIf you want to convert integer Y to a char Z then try\n\n\nchar *z = itoa( y, char *str, 10);\n\nI assumed here you are converting a number of base10.\n\nthis function returns the string str.. and that we are storing in z.\n\nHope you understood.

no i do not, because if you do you will have some vista files that cannot be installed on xp, or you might just love vista, but after you install vista RC1, because it is free, it will expire one day after about 6 months from the date you install it, and if you do now buy an upgrade disk for windows vista, the computer will now boot up and you will have to sweep the hard drive with the disk that came with the manufacturer of you computer, but if you do that you will not have any of your  files that were on xp or vista, you will only have a clean install of microsoft windows xp, and what i am saying is that would not be a wise decision to upgrade your computer to vista RC2, if you want to upgrade it buy the disc from microsoft when vista comes out.

C++ is the better language for doing programming, it is more functional and easier to use.\n\nC is closer to machine language than C++ and C programs will generally be more efficient than C++ programs which is a nonissue for 99.9% of applications and will more than most likely never effect you.\n\nDepending on why you are learning to program, you may want to focus on C++ and never bother to learn C. Even if you someday have need of C you will find that it is really just a slimmed down version of C++ which gives you a few extra ways to screw up your program.\n\nAfter learning to use C++ I would recommend studying java, it is a very modern language which is designed to be reliable and portable and I expect that it will be popular for a very long time.

I recommend intel CPUs if you want them for watching dvds, they are still simply the best rated internationally by IEEE and multiple other organizations, especially for media.

Steer clear of sony and dell they are not that great and you pay too much for name.  \n\nI do however recommend that if you are considering a major purchase such as this that you wait until windows vista comes out in the next few months and purchase a while after that to give some time for them to patch, etc.  The new windows will revolutionize many pc components capabilities.\nHope this helps

Install the Windows 98 CD into your CD rom and reboot the computer, then follow the prompts. Be advised though that you'll have to go to driverguide.com to search for drivers for your hardware unless you already have them on CDs. Also, many of the newer programs will not run in Windows 98. Good luck with that.

No, you don't have to worry about it, the virus is trapped and can't execute, however that would drive me nuts.  Back up any and all files you want... and reinstall Windows... sure you could go and try to remove it manually but that's just a pain (and you've probably spent more time doing that than you would have reinstalling Windows).  But if it won't bother you... then ignore it.

Hi there...although this iBook is a nice computer it will have several limitations.  Most of the software on the market available  today will not run optimally on this particular model as it is limited in hard disk size as well as memory capacity.  \n\nJaguar is the Mac operating system version 10.2 \nApple names each version:\n10.1 Puma\n10.2 Jaguar\n10.3 Panther\n10.4 Tiger (current version used now)\n10.5 Leopard (not yet released)
The first and easiest thing to try is to go into your Control Panel and open User Accounts.  Go into your profile and make sure you're set up as an administrator, not as a limited user. \n\nIf you're limited, you may need to log in as the administrator (all Windows 2000/XP computers have one), and you should be able to see it if you log out of your current profile.  Log in as the administrator and reopen User Accounts, and try upping your rights from there.\n\nGood luck.

if you mean Memory as in memory storage on drives then this is what i can help:\n\nC: is usally a main drive by default\nD-Z or more: is backup or any extra drive you have. or CD drives\n---------------\nif you have 2 hard drives(physicallly)\nmaybe you storing more files in D than in C.  check to see whats store in D and delete some.\n\nIf C is your not your main drive, inwhich the windows folder is located in your D drive, then this is not normal and can lead a lot of 3rd party software errors. \n\nBut wait what if you only have one Drive( that means one drive but windows says you have 2 hard drives) and you system spec stats only one Hard Drive. the computer manufactor must've partition it to make a backup drive.(really commom theses days) \n\nlet say you have 100gb Hard Drive\nbut when you check it i'ts only 90GB on C and  D has 10 GB (roughly). that usally a partition. it takes some storge from one and makes a new one :)\n\n--------------\nsometimes when computer that you buy from stores has a drive for the restore image so that when you computer goes bad, you can reformat and it comes back to life. so this drive is used as a backup and mainly should not be  touch with. \n------------\n\nLook at the size Ratio if C is only 100GB and D is 4GB thats usally a partition. And your C is 80GB FREE while D is 1GB free. that usally a system factory img store in there. if its like tis then yes your System is Normal :)

Young lady it really is not my desire to ruin your opportunity to go out with a man that you have met on a website.  (No dating site takes responsibility for your safety or welfare).  All they can do is give you safey tips and you have to use good common sense.    \n\nI am a clinical psychiatrist, single and my work as a volunteer medical doctor working in war zones has prevented me from having a true relationship.   Now that I don't work in war zones I like you want to give love and be loved on a personal basis.  \n\nMy own personal experience an I am very well trained in the art of self protection, is that the risk is very very high dating a person of the internet.  Does not matter how warmly they chat or appear to be on line.   Think about the fact that the picture that you see uploaded does not have to be the picure of the actual person that you chat with.  Nor does the person really need to show their true personality.  \n\nThe internet I found is an excellent place for people to be what ever they want or dream of being.   \n\nI am a person who is warm, loving and caring by nature and profession.  And my only desire is for you to be safe and sound.  \n\nI don't know you, but we are all God's children, so in reality we all have a moral and spiritual obligation to protect our brothers and sisters to the very best of our ability.   \n\nIf you wish to email me I will show you a picture of a young lady that we talked on MSN Messenger for one month and then we decided to meet.   When we met the young lady was not a lady, but a gay man.   \n\nI just told him that I was straight an if he wanted to see the sun come up the next morning that he would just turn around and walk away.   He could tell by the look in my eyes that I meant every word I said.    \n\nLife is a risk but harm can be avoided with very good common sense.    How much do you actually know about this man, do you know where he resides, his job, telephone, #, address or anything about him that can make you feel comfortable and secure.    \n\nEven if you tell your friends about when and where you think he is taking you.  They will not be there for you should the guy turn out to be a serial killer or God only knows what else.   \n\nMy advise to you is to meet this man in a very crowded public place where there are alot of people around.   And for God's sake don't leave with him to go anywhere.    Let him leave alone or you leave alone.  You want always to be around other people an in the public eye.  Stay out of his car or his home if you are invited as you for sure are going to be all alone.  \n\nReally don't know what else to tell you if you decide to take the risk.  Email me if you desire.\n\nIf you have a drink of any kind and happen to leave it while you go to the bathroom, be sure and dump the drink after you get back as drugs can be put into the drink and you will find yourself raped  or killed.\n\nClinical Psychiatrist.\n\nPlease excuse my english
It would be best to make them turn into the background and leave your picture the way it is.  Use the stamp tool in Photoshop.  Hold alt down and select an area near the person you want to delete to select an area, then click on their face.  It will turn into what you've selected.  You can align it or use the same area over and over and stamp out the faces you don't want.  Be creative and you can make it look like they were never in the picture in the first place.\n\nI use the stamp tool a lot.  It's incredible once you get the hang of it.

validation Rule :\nWhen you design a table in a database and you create a field that is supposed to hold a certain type of information, you may want to create an input mask to complement that field. What an input mask does is specifies an exact format for the information to be entered into the database. For example, a field such as phone # would be a good candidate for an input mask.\n\nValidatiion Text :\nThis property is related to the Validation Rule property and is used to specify an error message that will be displayed in case the validation rule is not satisfied.

They others are right.  You can not run two anti-virus programs at the same time.  They will conflict with each other, each trying to control any files you open so they can scan them, and each thinking the other is some type of virus trying to prevent it from working.\n\nIf you feel the need to have a second virus scanner on your PC, use one of the online scanners (like Mircotrend) which does not run in the background, but only when you go online and specifically run it. About once a week check the PC with it to be sure there is nothing the Norton or the AVG, whichever you choose, is missing.

Windows XP Professional makes the encryption and decryption process easy—simply follow the steps below to encrypt your files or folders. When you are logged on to your computer, you'll be able to read them. Anyone who tries to use your computer without your logon will not be able to read them.\nTo encrypt a file or folder\nClick Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Windows Explorer.\nRight–click the file or folder that you want to encrypt, and then click Properties.\nOn the General tab, click Advanced.\nSelect the Encrypt contents to secure data check box.\nEncrypt contents to use secure data \nApply to changes to this folder & subfolders & files . hit on ok \n\nTo decrypt a file or folder\nClick Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Windows Explorer.\nRight–click the file or folder that you want to decrypt, and then click Properties.\nOn the General tab, click Advanced.\nClear the Encrypt contents to secure data check box.

To explain a complicated subject in simple words, IP routing is like regular traffic on the roads.\n\nDifferent countries have different rules that state how you can drive, just like different networks have different routing protocols that state how packets can traverse it.\n\nAll roads that will take you anywhere will have road signs that tell you how far your destination is, and how to get there. IP routing is the road sign of the network. It tells routers where the packets they receive are destined for, and how to get there.\n\nAll roads have law enforcement patrolling them, preventing people from driving in a manner that they aren't desired to. IP routing allows you to set your own rules and laws, and prevent packets from traversing the network in a manner that you don't want them to.\n\nThe wiki page should explain it in a bit more detail. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing

Using an algorithm in planning for a solution helps in several ways.\n\nFirst, it allows the individual to see things in a wider perspective - thereby weeding through all other possible solutions to pick the best one.  Since in coming up with an algorithm the individual is not stuck with using a specific language, the person may use whatever tool (i.e. flowchart, layman's term, etc.) that is comfortable; putting emphasis on how to go about solving an issue.\n\nSecond, algorithms serve as the framework to which the actual solution is patterned after.  This guides the individual in the process of deriving the solution, thus saving time and effort as compared to having one jump immediately to this stage without any plan.\n\nLastly, algorithms can become generic templates to which other issues may refer to for solutions.  If properly documented or easily recalled, an algorithm used to solve one problem can guide the individual in resolving another one of similar nature.

Normally an Information Server is used within a company intranet to give out time, date, calender, etc information to the users on the network. Typically it is used to distribute files, programs, and information sent by one person to another person or to several people. You would use this in a company that needs to share out digital memos, calendered events, email between users in the company, etc. You could also use this type of server in an environment with dumb terminals or a client/server networking scheme. While a Web Server is primarily used to send information to people outside the company. It is used to set up the website, distribute the website, and hold all the website's resources, coding, and security. You would use this type of server if your company had a large website, or a medium sized website that you wanted to keep secure and distribute out over the internet. It can be done other ways though a Web Server is the preferred method.
So many variables.\n\nCan the servers see each other?\n\nI am sure you have checked the IP and Mask?\n\nFirst suspect I would look at if I were called to fix the problem is DNS.\n\nIf your clients are getting a dhcp from some other source than the Servers then the Name Servers will have no idea what your servers are.\n\nReally hard to answer this question without more information.

I think you will find the problem could potentially be the type of disc that you used.  There are two camps of manufacturer in the DVD world - the +version and the -version (such as Panasonic) which means a DVD-R will not play back in a +manufacturer's machine as they are incompatible.  Although this is being improved it is something that a lot of people are unaware of.  I am sure you can play your DVD-R recording in another -R machine but obviously this doesn't really help.\nI would suggest you upload the footage to your computer and then save that file on a USB stick.  Then take that file to a +Recordable computer and re-burn the disc.  This should then work...hopefully.

"I'm not familiar with that specific game, but most games have minimum requirements for the PC they are to be played on. You can usually get away with being close to those specs if you don't meet them outright, by lowering the levels of eye candy (resolution, anti-aliasing, available features and detail levels, etc.) but the game may simply require more than your video card can provide. In unusual cases a really fast computer can provide some of the capabilities of the graphics card in the CPU, but you'd probably have a fast graphics card to match a fast CPU anyway.\n\nThe 16MB of the video card speaks to how large a texture map it can hold -- the texture map is an image that gets draped over a surface in the game by the video card to make it appear more detailed and complex then it really is. Since your error message says ""MISSING TEXTURE"" I'd have to believe it didn't have enough room in the available RAM on the video card to hold the surfaces it needed to apply in the game. Good luck."

"Did anyone see that documentary about an artifact that was found in the eastern Mediteranean?  It was totally encrusted, but under xray you could see there was some kind of device inside with very intricuit clock-like counting mechanisms.  They proposed that it might have been some sort of counting or computing device.  I believe it was dated to B.C. ...I just found this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAncient artifacts discovered imbedded in solid rock, as well as artifacts found on the ocean floor, give evidence to the fact that our ancient ancestors were FAR more intelligent in the scientific realm than we give them credit for. Yves Naud describes in his book, one such artifact: ""In 1900, sponge divers near Antikythera (Greece), found rusty fragments of a metallic apparatus on the sea floor. Scientists at first thought that they were remnants of an astrolabe dating from 65 B.C. In 1959, the English scientist, Solla Price, made a discovery which astounded the professional world when he published it in the NATURAL HISTORY review of March 1962: \n\n""'It appears that this object is really a computer which can determine and describe the movements of the sun, of the moon, and probably of the planets.' \n\n""This modern expert felt extremely humble and could only pay homage to the high science of our ancestors, although the homage was tinged with fear. \n\n""'It is quite frightening,' he wrote in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (June, 1959), 'to learn that, shortly before their great civilization crumbled, THE ANCIENT GREEKS had come as close as this to our time, not only in terms of their thinking, but also in their scientific technology.'"""
A raster graphics image, digital image, or bitmap, is a data file or structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, on a computer monitor, paper, or other display device. The color of each pixel is individually defined; images in the RGB color space, for instance, often consist of colored pixels defined by three bytes—one byte each for red, green and blue. Less colorful images require less information per pixel;\n\nan image with only black and white pixels requires only a single bit for each pixel. Raster graphics are distinguished from vector graphics in that vector graphics represent an image through the use of geometric objects such as curves and polygons.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap

By rebooting you probably mean reinstalling OS. No, that doesn't matter. If you purchase a software on-line it comes with the product number which you must enter to make it active. When you purchase it, they send it to you by email and is there for you to reinstall it as many times as you want. Also most of the products sold on-line come in the CD package, but lately it's not that popular because of easy to purchase/use over the Internet.
Your best bet is talking to HP Support and getting them to walk you through it.

I would wait.  Notify ebay of what is going on so that they too are informed.  And it is rude of the seller to be hounding you.  It sounds to me as if the Seller might need your money to pay for the tickets themselves.

G'day,\n\nFirst... have you changed anything in your internet connection/the way you connect to internet.  Sometimes the problem occur when you have changed the internet/network setting due to different DNS setting.  You may want to chat with your internet provider to make sure that at you do not have problem with your internet connection.\n\nIf they already confirm that there's no problem with the internet connection then II have a feeling that your computer has been infected by virus or spyware.  A few tips as follows:\n1. Run virus and spyware scans from safe mode (restart the computer and press F8 button several times until the option menu appear).\n2. Reinstall IE from the OS CD\n\nIf these basic steps did not fix the problem then you will need to reformat your HDD since the OS has been compromised very badly and this problem is just the tip of the iceberg.  You will need to back-up your datafiles and e-mails (if using Outlook).  Then reformat your HDD and reinstall the OS & programs.  This steps will make sure that there are no bugs and problems with the operating system anymore.  Just make sure you have the OS and drivers CD ready, since formatting will ERASE EVERYTHING in your HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck!

I guess you're saying either turn it off with the power switch or pulling the power.  Neither way is a recommended method.  Even if you've closed all programs there are still processes running in the background in Windows.  Doing the Shut Down procedure in Windows is the preferred way because it stops everything and then turns it off.  Now sometimes it's not avoidable such as during a lockup but that's the only time I would suggest doing that.  Over many times of shutting the machine off improperly you will get system errors.

The longer a computer stays on, the longer it builds up dust inside, which can reduce cooling efficiency of the cooling fans.

The strip itself can't handle a major voltage spike, like you will see from lightening. Of course, a modem would be an additional point of voltage spike with lightening, one the powerstrip won't help.\n\nThere will be a small amount of power going through part of the system when it's powered down, but still has power to the plug, but most of the circuitry will not be live.\n\nDisadvantages exist if you are connected to the internet 24/7.

To play most modern game you will have to change 2 (maybe 3) things on your PC.\n\n1. Your graphics card, I believe the 6100 is onboard.  There are problems with this graphics card (the 6100 and the 6200) when playing certain games, even though it's in the 6 range this is the lowest of that range.  If you stick with nVidia change it to the 6600 or the 7600.  You will notice the improved performance straight away when playing games like Oblivion.\n\n2. Increase your RAM, 256-512mb is the norm now a days for games, but remember you will also have background proceses running in Windows while you play games.  Increase this to a minimum of 1 gb, pref 2gb.  Again you will see a good inprovement when you play games.\n\n3. This is optional, a bigger hard drive.  Depending on how much space you have left on your PC, you may wish to have more.  Remember you need at lest 12% free disk space to perform a good defrag and with new games taking more and more space, you'll soon run out of HD space.  Maybe upgrade to a 200gb drive or bigger.\n\nThe rest of your spec's are great.  Remember AMD mark up their CPU's differently than Intel, so because you have a 3300+, it's preformance speed is suppose to run at a 3ghz chip while it's core speed run's at 2ghz. *However in the next few yesrs you may wish to take a look at the dual core chips from AMD & Intel, but it's not necessary at the moment.\n\nHope this helps

An attachment to an electronic message used for security purposes. The most common use of a digital certificate is to verify that a user sending a message is who he or she claims to be, and to provide the receiver with the means to encode a reply.\n\nAn individual wishing to send an encrypted message applies for a digital certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA). The CA issues an encrypted digital certificate containing the applicant's public key and a variety of other identification information. The CA makes its own public key readily available through print publicity or perhaps on the Internet.\n\nThe recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA's public key to decode the digital certificate attached to the message, verifies it as issued by the CA and then obtains the sender's public key and identification information held within the certificate. With this information, the recipient can send an encrypted reply.\n\nThe most widely used standard for digital certificates is X.509. \n\nFor further information just refer this link :\n\nhttp://www.verisign.com.au/repository/tutorial/digital/intro1.shtml

if you currently have XP 2800, there are many other CPU's with same price as dual core 805 that can boost your gaming speed.\n\nDon't get confuse about speed and multi-tasking.  \n\nFor $100, you can buy a dual-core 805 or a pentium 4 541 3.2GHZ 800MHZ.\n\nThe matter of choice really rely on what you use the system for.  Dual-core can handle multitasking extremely well.  For instant, it allow you encode a DVD and playing game at the same time.  The pentium 541 in the other hand will significantly speed up single task program, like gamming machine. \n\nSo if multi-tasking is not important, consider a single core.\n\ngood luck

laptop computers can be a rather tricky buy at times, I would suggest that you look out for the cheapest and yet latest desktop on the market, the best way to do this is on what they call warehouse sale markets some of them are online. these warehouse owners have a service where they sell laptop computers to normal customers like you and me, however with very reduced prices due to the fact that they do not have as much costs as normal shops do, such as rent and a employees etc. as you know most online shops have rather competitive prices sometimes cutting the laptop price to a half. one such website for laptop computers is : \n\nhttp://umgarticles.atspace.com/laptop-computer.htm\n\nif it helps kindly remember me in your voting!.. cheers!

it depends on what wireless chip you have. If you have a built in one, you need to run the program which would be found on your start menu&#92;all programs list. you should then choose the network you wish to connect to and then click connect.
This usually comes up when you hook something up to a USB port (such as a flash drive, a camera, mp3 player, etc...). This is normal, and it just means that you can safely remove the device that is plugged into the port.
Check on anything that you have installed recently.  Norton Antivirus suddenly made my CD drives vanish a few years ago so I had to uninstall it and stop using it and then all was fine.  Some software like that can cause them to vanish.  Try uninstalling recent software and see if that helps.  If your drive has power - drawer opens etc then it should be recognised even if it won't read a CD.  Try a system restore to before you had this problem and all should be well.
Check your system clock and calendar working normally.\nIf not change the battery of motherboard. \nI hope this will do\nregards

"Hi there,\n\nInstead of all these ""Mine is better than yours"" answers that go on around here, I'll instead answer with the facts.\n\nQuite simply - Yes, Norton IS much better than AVG and Avast.\n\nLooking at current protection ratings, AVG scores a lowly 90% protection against all known viruses, whilst Avast comes in at 92%.  This means they are letting through one in every ten viruses - pretty shocking.\n\nNorton on the other hand is protecting against something like 98.3% of all known viruses - a much better score.\n\nHowever as people have mentioned, Norton is know for being a very heavy program which can tend to slow down certain machines.  If you are thinking of installing Norton I would definitely recommend you download their free trial to check it does not affect your machine in this way prior to opening your wallet.\n\nIf you would be interested in other Security products that are better than Norton, you should try either Prevx1, Kaspersky or F-Secure who all score over a 99% protection rating."

"Not too sure about Airport time out issues either.  For VNC, I use that a lot between my Macs and PCs.   On the Mac (10.4 preferred), you can either turn on Apple's own Apple Remote Desktop (System Pref -> Sharing, choose Apple Remote Desktop.  Click on Access privileges, grant yourself full access + check on the VNC viewers ... and set a password)  OR OSXVNC (free ... the new version is called Vine Server)  To install this guy, download it from their site (you can do a Yahoo search on osxvnc).  Double click the DMG file, drag and drop the content (Vine Server) onto your Application folder.  To configure it, launch the app, set a password and you're set to go!  Client for VNC, I would go with ""Chick of the VNC"".  Do the same get process as osxvnc, search for it on Yahoo, get the DMG, drag to Application folder and launch!  It can memorize your controlled machines, which is cool.  It doesn't care if the destination is Mac or Win as long as you have the right IP address and password.  Right clicking on a VNC Win machine can be a pain if you don't have dual button mouse.  You have to hold down control + shift + click to do right click on the PC you're controlling.\n\nOn Windows, I use UltraVNC (also free).  It comes with both server and clients.  The server is as easy to setup as OSXVNC (when you launch it, it stays on your tray, double click it to give it a password)  Then, with the client, supply the IP address of the Mac or Win you want to control + password.  There's also WinVNC -- the downside is that WinVNC will auto start itself, you have to manually shut it down if you don't want it running all the time.  There are 64 bit versions of the VNC for UltraVNC -- do a quick yahoo search of ""ultravnc 64"""

Hi!\nI think any HP slimline model is perfect!
Depends a lot on what board you've got it plugged into.  If you are looking for a board I recommend the Abit Fatality AN8 SLI for overclocking - it's what it was designed for.\n\nOtherwise, google your board model and find overclocking info that way.

"The biggest question HOW you shut your system down.  Hitting the power button on your computer won't necessarily shut the system down.  It could put into standby or hibernation mode.\n\nThe only way to guarantee you're computer completely shut down is to go to Start -> Shut Down & hit Shut Down.\n\nAlternatively, your system may include a ""Remote Boot-up"" option.  This is more common with business-related systems, which allows a person (like from the IT department) to boot up a computer remotely.  You'll most likely will need to check your computer's BIOS to see if your computer has this option.\n\nIf your computer does have a ""Remote Boot-up"" option in your BIOS, you'll want to disable it as somebody may be trying to hack into your system & found out about this little option... making it even easier to hack into your system if you're not careful.  Alternatively, you'll probably want a router with a built-in firewall to help prevent this (although it may not protect you from any roommates who are jerking you around with this).\n\nFinally, check for viruses & other malware.  There are some nasty stuff online which may have gotten onto your system somehow (either it's a brand new virus OR you're too stupid/lazy to install & update an anti-virus program...  like my neighbor).  If it gets into the BIOS, it could be able to turn your computer on & off by itself...  although I'm unsure on exactly how, but it could happen as some computer components are becoming more software-controlled.\n\nIf this is the case, call somebody you know that's an expert in computers as you obviously need some help.\n\nI hope this can help you out...  or at least give you some ideas to check."

This is a security setting in Internet Explorer.  (Tools, then Internet Options, then Security, then Custom Level...)\n\nThis setting gives you the option to allow IE to display subframes that originated from different domains. A subframe is a portion of a Web page that could function as a standalone page but has instead been incorporated into a larger page that may contain other subframes.\n\nYou can enable or disable this option, or you may prompt the user. Having subframes that come from different domains, however, is generally harmless and so is permitted by default.
The size of the monitor is secondary to the resolution of the monitor. Make sure that the 15 inch monitor has the same resolution as the 17inch that you're using to author pages. Also, in Front Page 2000 and up, you can set the resolution of the 'output' page to whatever you like. If your 15inch monitor isn't capable of displaying, say 1024x768, you'll have to adjust the 17inch down to 800x600 for example. Don't forget to ajust the Front Page setting to match.

This is a 'catch-all' error generated by your Web server. Basically something has gone wrong, but the server can not be more specific about the error condition in its response to the client. In addition to the 500 error notified back to the client, the Web server should generate some kind of internal error log which gives more details of what went wrong. It is up to the operators of your Web server site to locate and analyse these logs. \nAny client (e.g. your Web browser or our CheckUpDown robot) goes through the following cycle when it communicates with your Web server:\n\nObtain an IP address from the IP name of your site (your site URL without the leading 'http://'). This lookup (conversion of IP name to IP address) is provided by domain name servers (DNSs). \nOpen an IP socket connection to that IP address. \nWrite an HTTP data stream through that socket. \nReceive an HTTP data stream back from your Web server in response. This data stream contains status codes whose values are determined by the HTTP protocol. Parse this data stream for status codes and other useful information. \nNothing you can do on your end its a server problem and needs to be fixed at their end

Yes you can as I have done it many times and it is not hard at all to do. Take a fine needle nose pliers and very small micro screw driver. First ground yourself. Using a magnifying glass straighten out the pin and match it with the others in the roll of pins along each side of the bent pin. Keep in mind this may not go straight into its socket after you straighten it out. Gently giggle it around in the processors socket till it slides in. You will know if it goes in correctly or not because it will lay flush in the socket after it slips in. Never, throw away a processor because of a bent pin. I have straightened out as many as 10 to 15 pins because the processor fell to the ground or something like that. What is there to lose? Really???
If he has access to your computer, then he could look at your internet history - you can clear this information by pressing shift-delete in Firefox, or by delving into the internet options in IE somewhere.\n\nIf he does not have access to your computer, then no, it is not possible for him to find out what you've been up to.

The only place where there is information that you have stored on the computer is on the Hard Drive.  Open your computer's case.

It should have just a power cable and a ribbon cable going to it.  It is usually about an inch tall, maybe 3-4 inches wide, and 5-6 inches long. You will probably need a phillips screwdriver to remove this. Remove the cables as well. When you have it out, that is the only thing you will have to destroy.  Soak it in water for about an hour, then with a hammer and a screwdirver, punch through the case in a couple of spots and throw it in the garbage.\n\nThere is no info saved on any of the other parts of your computer.

You can download free softwares at\nhttp://fixit.in/antivirus.html and http://fixit.in/spywareremover.html \nAfter running the virus scan delete all temprory internet files including off line content  and also unwanted files and temp. files. Finally, carryout a defragmentation . Your system will be back to the normal...!

To be honest, the cost of repairing them would end up around the same as buying them new - you'd find any reputable repairer would urge you not to bother, unless it was simply a minor issue (such as buttons needing to be replaced). The real cost in LCD monitors (apart from paying for the name anyway) is the cost of the screen itself. Besides the, the overall quality of LCD monitors has improved immensely even over the last 12mths, so even working you wouldn't get much for them.\n\nIf you are looking to replace, have a look at the BenQ screens - they've been building LCD monitors longer than almost anyone else, and thus their quality is damned good - and their prices are lower than anything else of the same quality. I know that doesn't help you with your old monitors, but it should at least than should give you an improved run this time around.

"I would start with Virus/Spyware scans. Be sure to update your Virus definitions first. (always a good place to start and quick to do). \n\nAs you didn't mention your OS I will assume you have Windows XP. However, all instructions will still work, just slightly different menu options.\n\nAnother quick attempt to resolve this would be to clear the temporary Internet files and the history cache.\n\n1. Start Internet Explorer. \n2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options. \n3. Under Temporary Internet files, click Delete Files, click to select the Delete all offline content check box, and then click OK. \n4. Under History, click Clear History, and then click OK. \n5. Clear the temporary Internet files and the history cache. To do this, click Clear History under History, click Yes, and then click OK. \n6. Restart Internet Explorer. \n\nNext I would move onto toolbars (Google Toolbar, Yahoo Toolbar, HotBar, etc.) Sometimes these plugin toolbars don't play nice with each other. They could also be corrupt or just poorly written. I'd remove them all and then reinstall only the ones your want. (sometimes spyware automatically installs toolbars on you)\n\n1. Close all open Internet Explorer windows.\n2. Open the Control Panel (Click on Start, Control Panel or Start, Run and type CONTROL then click OK)\n2. Select Add/Remove Programs\n3. Select a toolbar listed and then click Remove/Uninstall.\n4. Repeat for each toolbar found and then Reboot.\n\n\nThis issue can also occur as a result of a corrupt index.dat file used by Internet Explorer.\n\nTo remove the history folder\n1. Restart the computer. \n2. Use a different account w/admin rights to log on to the computer. \n3. Open Windows Explorer. \n4. Locate the C:&#92;Documents and Settings&#92;username&#92;Local Settings&#92;History folder for the username you normally use.\n\nAlso - The Local Settings folder is a hidden folder. To view this folder, enable the Show hidden files and folders option in Windows Explorer. To do this, click the Tools menu in Windows Explorer, click Folder Options, click the View tab, enable the Show hidden files and folders option. \n\n5. Right-click the History folder, and then click Delete. \n6. When you are prompted to confirm the folder removal, click Yes. \n7. Close Windows Explorer. \n8. Restart the computer. \n9. Log on to the computer as you normally do\n10. Start Internet Explorer. \n11. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options. \n12. Under Temporary Internet files, click Delete Files, click to select the Delete all offline content check box, and then click OK. \n13. Restart Internet Explorer. \n\nLastly, I would try to scan for any corrupt files. There could be a corrupt dll or one replaced by another program which is being used by Internet Explorer.\n\n1. Click Start, Run, Type ""sfc /scannow"" (w/out the quotes)\n2. Click on OK and follow the prompts. (you may need your Windows CD for this)\n3. When completed - reboot.\n\nIf this doesn't work there are even more steps you can take. However, one of the above steps should resolve it for you."

the copy command is used to copy one file to a specific location. I haven't come across a move command, but if there is one, then it probably moves a file to a specific location (i found that the rename command can be used to move a file from one directory to another)\n\nAfter using the copy command, you get two copies of a file, in different locations. After moving a file, you still have one copy of that file.

"A Celeron is any of a large number of different budget x86 microprocessors produced by Intel and marketed as a budget/value CPU line. The Celeron family complements Intel's higher-performance (and more expensive) Pentium CPUs family. Introduced in April 1998, the first Celeron was based on the Pentium II core. Later versions were based on the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Pentium M. These processors are suitable for most applications, but their performance is somewhat limited when it comes at running intense applications, such as cutting edge games or graphical modeling programs, especially when compared to that of their high-end counterparts.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe new chip family, which includes the processor formerly known by the code name Banias, was designed to help manufacturers build notebooks that use less power and offer extended battery life, along with better wireless networking capabilities. Instead of just giving Banias a variation on the company's well-known Pentium moniker, Intel decided to set the family of chips apart with a completely new name. A few insiders at Intel had been jokingly referring to the Banias chip as Mobilium, but Intel will call the new chip itself Pentium-M. Intel says the Centrino name, and a new logo that goes with it, suggest flight and mobility. The name is a blend of the words ""center"" and ""neutrino,"" the company said. (A Google search on ""centrino"" also reveals the term to be a common one in Italian embroidery circles.) ""The Centrino brand signifies a new generation of mobile PCs that will change where and how people compute,"" Pam Pollace, vice president and director of Intel's corporate marketing group, said in a statement. The Centrino family will also include chipsets, which handle data inside a PC, and wireless radio modules designed to allow new notebooks to use 802.11 wireless networking."

"What mail servers are you running and where are the mail databases stored (what kind of storage, not what physical location)? \n\nMost commercial, business-grade backup software is email server aware and comes with different API's for the various back-end platforms (MS Exchange, SendMail, GroupWise, etc). The least complicated and most effective solution is to leverage the backup product you already have, and call the appropriate API's to back up your mail databases as part of your regular backup routines.\n\nIf you're an end user and not a tech, you won't have the access rights to run a batch file or anything else against the mail server so your only choice is to manually forward the existing emails to a personal account somewhere. That'd be each person forwarding all their own emails. You *may* be able to set up a ""rule"" to forward any new, incoming mail but you won't be able to forward the existing mail other than manually. And many mail systems block outgoing mail if it's bound for the Internet and has been automatically forwarded, for security reasons.  If I were an end user, I'd check with the IT folks to see what they're doing for backups--- you may be worrying about something that's already been taken care of for you. (I get the feeling there's been a major outage somewhere in the recent past for you?)\n\nIf you want to discuss further, feel free to send me a message offline--- click on my avatar then click the ""Send email"" link (or whatever it says).  Especially if you are a tech. I am positively frightened for you, if you don't have a current backup mechanism in place for your emails."

Then restart and erase all your cached files. In IE, go to TOOLS->INTERNET OPTIONS then click DELETE FILES under the Temporary Internet Files Section.

It sends all email addresses it finds to the spammer at the following web site ""www.av3.net/index.htm"" (don't go there or you'll be infected).

"It is a little more complex then that. First you need to make the files, & then you need to link it to the page (run the script/files in the html code) so it knows what to do with the files.

How to add it is the easy part, making the flash files or java script is the hard part.\n\nAdding this ticker to your Webpage\nThe above ticker can be easily edited with any text editor to add your own custom phrases. \n\nStep 1:\nPut the following files in your website directory: \n\nticker.swf\nticker.js\nticker.xml\n\n\nStep 2:\nPut the following line of code on your webpage somewhere after the ""BODY"" tag.

Exact placement is not important. \n\n<script language=""JavaScript"" src=""ticker.js""></script> \n\nStep 3:\nAdd the following line of code to your coolstyle.css or your corporatestyle.css at the very bottom. \n\n#ticker { right: 10px; POSITION: absolute; top: 10px } \n\nPlacement on the Page:\nOnce you have completed the above steps your ticker should be on the page.

You can change the pixels from the ""top"" or from the ""right"". You can also change the ""right"" and make it left. \n\nOptional Placement on the Page:\nIf you want you do not need to edit the coolstyle.css or your corporatestyle.css at all and the ticker will be placed wherever you have placed the .js code.

Polymorphism deals with abstract classes, where a virtual method is defined, but an implementation is not provided. It is up to the derived concrete class to provide the implemenation, which could vary widely from derived class to derived class.\n\nA client program calls the virtual method, but the functionality executed will vary depending upon the concrete class implementing the abstract interface being used.\n\nThe classic example is the abstract class Shape, used in a graphical design program. Many real shapes are derived from it, such as, Circle, Square, Rectangle and Line. Shape defines the abstract draw() method, but each derived class has to provide the implementation, which will vary for each of the above.\n\nNow the set of Shapes in a picture can be drawn with a method that looks like of like the following...\n\nPicture::draw()\n{\nfor each shape in Shape...\nshape.draw()\n}\n\nIf Picture contains all circles, then only Circle::draw() will be called. If it contains all squares, then only Square::draw() will be called, If the Picture contains a mixture of shapes, then each unique draw() method will be called.\n\nIf  new shape is added, Picture::draw() doesn't need to be changed.

Hi there,\n\nI'm pretty sure that you have to have an active phone line (with verizon for instance) to be able to get verizon dsl service. You can always call verizon guys and ask about that. And then if you have to have their phone service, just opt for the cheapest option possible (I'm paying like $14.95 a month) plus same for their cheapest verizon dsl (768Kbps download/64Kbps upload). Also, with dsl you get point to point connection and your download/upload speed is always constant while with cable internet more neighbors connect your connection is getting slower because they all share the same internet 'pipe'.\nAll best,\nBora
Microsoft Access is excellent at creating databases in a simple home based environment. You can buy at through any Windows Office package (the later, the more advanced). There you can go through a Database Wizard that gives you a step by step on how to create your own Database. With this database, you can literally store all your documents, videos, and pictures in one thing and can be accessed through one search. Though this will take some time as you must locate all file locations and provide descriptions / keywords for each.

You have two options, network, or plug and play.\n\nFor networking, it takes more time to setup though may be more efficient in the long run. You will need to connect the two computers together with your network cable and on both computers, go to Control Panel and set up a home network. Make sure to have your printer connected to the host computer.\n\nFor plug and play, it is much more easy and may only take one a two seconds longer in the long run. Just install the printer driver on both your computers and plug the USB connection to the computer you want to print from. The downside to this method is that both your computers and printer have to be located close to each other.

Yes. AVG slows down our computer because it would tempt to open up a popup beside the taskbar to inform us that we have a virus detected. That popup is heavy duty unlike with Norton antivirus which is simple and lighweight to use. Other than slowing down our PC, it can't even protect us from newly created viruses such as brontoks. They are not providing real-time virus definition updates. But if you prefer a free antivirus software then Avast is your choice :)

"The Via Raid Tool is a RAID controller for a Via chipset in your motherboard. RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a method of taking multiple physical hard drives and making them function as a single logical volume (ie, you can have 2x 250gig hard drives, and the operating system you're using will see them as 1x 500 gig drive.) Raid also allows things like mirroring (where the 2x 250gig drives look like a single 250 gig drive), with any individual piece of data copied, or ""mirrored"" to both drives. This allows you to have 2 copies of every bit of stored data in case of a drive failure, if you have such critical data. There's also a function called ""striping,"" where data is split evenly across drives to increase performance. \n\nThere's a bunch of other odds and ends, with parity and without, and some bits like Striping + Mirroring, and the like. \n\nThat's basically a very rough overview of RAID. As a general rule, if you didn't know what RAID is, likely you don't particularly need it. Most likely it can be safely removed, unless your system came preconfigured for RAID, which is a bit unlikely."

"It looks like you're referring to broadband connections.  A simple answer to your question won't be exact, since there are many variables.  A low-end Digital Subscriber Link Like I used to have (Qwest) advertised 256K download speeds, but provided as little as 60-156k download speeds. When I called their tech support, the guy said, ""Oh, you never get the advertised speed.""   There are faster DSL providers, but they charge more.  A cable broadband service (like mine....Comcast) advertises much higher speeds than it actually delivers.  I get between 1 meg and 3 meg download speeds, when the advertised speed is more than double my average download speed.  With cable, the connection is shared with others in your neighborhood, so the speed goes down when more people are on line. With DSL, your speed will be fairly stable, but much lower on the average."

There are several programs that are free that can do write movies to DVD RW. Just look up my source and search for DVD burner. I must caution using DVD RW disks and their use as movies. DVD RW is intended to store data that is changing. They make great backup disks and can be erased if the file change is too great. However, over time, DVD RW does loose their ability to store large amounts of data. This is accelerated when the DVD RW is forced to hold almost a full disc and then erased to hold another full disk (The average movie is about 3.8 GB). If you keep re-using A DVD RW just for movies, then you will literally burn out your disc. DVD R is intended to be used on data that is not changing. Like movies for example. I would have to say use a DVD R for movies and use the DVD RW for any data needs. Again, you can use DVD RW for movies but I would not want to waste a DVD RW on just movies.

"i have very simple solution, i have pdf file for you, just simply contact me and receive it,\n\nhere is some data inside pdf file.\n\nOn-Line Analytic Processing\nWe shall now take up an important class of applications for integrated informa-\ntion systems, especially data warehouses. Companies and organizations create\na warehouse with a copy of large amounts of their available data and assign\nanalysts to query this warehouse for patterns or trends of importance to the or-\nganization. This activity, called OLAP (standing for On-Line Analytic Process-\ning and pronounced &#92;oh-lap""), generally involves highly complex queries that\nuse one or more aggregations. These queries are often termed OLAP queries\nor decision-support queries. Some examples will be given in Section 20.4.1; a\ntypical example is to search for products with increasing or decreasing overall\nsales.\nDecision-support queries used in OLAP applications typically examine very\nlarge amounts of data, even if the query results are small. In contrast, common\ndatabase operations, such as bank deposits or airline reservations, each touch\nonly a tiny portion of the database; the latter type of operation is often referred\nto as OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing, spoken &#92;oh-ell-tee-pee"").\nRecently, new query-processing techniques have been developed that are\nespecially good at executing OLAP queries e�ectively. Furthermore, because of\nthe distinct nature of a certain class of OLAP queries, special forms of DBMS's\nhave been developed and marketed to support OLAP applications. The same\ntechnology is beginning to migrate to standard SQL systems, as well. We shall\ndiscuss the architecture of these systems in Section 20.5.\n20.4.1 OLAP Applications\nA commonOLAP application uses a warehouse of sales data. Major store chains\nwill accumulate terabytes of information representing every sale of every item\nat every store. Queries that aggregate sales into groups and identify signi�cant\ngroups can be of great use to the company in predicting future problems and\nopportunities.\nExample 20.27 : Suppose the Aardvark Automobile Co. builds a data ware-\nhouse to analyze sales of its cars. The schema for the warehouse might be:\nSales(serialNo, date, dealer, price)\nAutos(serialNo, model, color)\nDealers(name, city, state, phone)\nA typical decision-support query might examine sales on or after April 1, 2001\nto see how the recent average price per vehicle varies by state. Such a query is\nshown in Fig. 20.19.\nNotice how the query of Fig. 20.19 touches much of the data of the database,\nas it classi�es every recent Sales fact by the state of the dealer that sold it.\nIn contrast, common OLTP queries, such as &#92;�nd the price at which the auto\nwith serial number 123 was sold,"" would touch only a single tuple of the data.\n2\n20.4. ON-LINE ANALYTIC PROCESSING 1047\nWarehouses and OLAP\nThere are several reasons why data warehouses play an important role in\nOLAP applications. First, the warehouse may be necessary to organize\nand centralize corporate data in a way that supports OLAP queries; the\ndata may initially be scattered across many di�erent databases. But often\nmore important is the fact that OLAP queries, being complex and touch-\ning much of the data, take toomuch time to be executed in a transaction-\nprocessing system with high throughput requirements. OLAP queries of-\nten can be considered &#92;long transactions"" in the sense of Section 19.7.\nLong transactions locking the entire database would shut down the\nordinary OLTP operations (e.g., recording new sales as they occur could\nnot be permitted if there were a concurrent OLAP query computing av-\nerage sales). A common solution is to make a copy of the raw data in a\nwarehouse, run OLAP queries only at the warehouse, and run the OLTP\nqueries and data modi�cations at the data sources. In a common sce-\nnario, the warehouse is only updated overnight, while the analysts "

Sounds like a communication error between the BIOS and the harddrive, or you have a bad harddrive.\n\nBe sure to check the following things....\n\n1.  Make sure the Harddrive is set up correctly in the computer.  Meaning that the proper cables are plugged into the correct slots on the motherboard and the harddrive is set on master.\n\n2.  Make sure the harddrive is set up in the BIOS to be read by the system during the boot up sequence.  This is how the system knows that a harddrive is on the system.\n\n3.  See if you can boot up the PC normally without trying to install Windows.  If this does work then there's a problem with the Windows installation CD or the way you're trying to install Windows XP.\n\nIf none of the solutions above seem to work, then most likely you have a bad harddrive.

"Remember when you FIRST enter the page, there is no such thing about the variable $do since $_POST array does not exist!\n\nI see multiple problems over there.\n- Your form has the method of POST, so why do you use GET  ?\n +  $do=$_GET['do'];  should be $do=$_POST['do'];\n- Now since the variable do does not exist you could do a simple if statement that checks that. The function isset checks if that variable exists.\n + $do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send'  : 'ok';\n- But there is another problem, The hidden name for do does not exist.. So lets change it to do\n + <input type=""hidden"" name=""do"" value=""ok"">\n\n[now the overall code]\n=============================\n<html>\n<body>\n<?php\n\n// Lets initialize the variable\n$do = isset($_POST['do']) ? 'send'  : 'ok';\n\n// Lets just display the current Action\necho 'ACTION:'.$do;\n\n// Check if the hidden variable was sent\nif ($do == 'send') {\n\n // Lets print out the post array\n var_dump($_POST);\n\n} else { ?>\n <form method=""POST"" action="""">\n <p><input type=""submit"" value=""Submit"" name=""submit""></p>\n <input type=""hidden"" name=""do"" value=""ok"">\n </form>\n<?php } ?>\n</body>\n</html>\n=============================\nI took out the other forms...\n\nThe above should work.. Now.. But why introduce another variable if you already have the submit variable intact? What you could do is say $do = isset($_POST['submit']) ? 'send'  : 'Submit'; That will remove that hidden field. Another thing I realize is that your mixing HTML code with PHP code which is BAD PRACTICE. I recommend you to at least separate them, or if you don't want to use a templating engine, I recommend you do at least store the output in one variable like outvar = """". That will take out alot of issues in the future.\n\nAnyways.. Good Luck"

"software\nOne entry found for software.\n \n\nMain Entry: soft·ware \nPronunciation: 'soft-""war, -""wer\nFunction: noun\n: something used or associated with and usually contrasted with hardware: as a : the entire set of programs, procedures, and related documentation associated with a system and especially a computer system; specifically : computer programs b : materials for use with audiovisual equipment"
firstly you should find what format the song is recorded on\n      hopefully it will be in wma or mp3 format,if thats the case you should just save it in a folder to be played on your windows media player\n     files dont actually get saved on a media player,you can scan your p.c by going to media player>file>add to libary>by searching computer>media player will then search for any music files (wma,mp3,wav),you have on your hard drive\n    however if your song is in a unrecognized format you will need a tool to convert it to wma or mp3\n   awave studio is great for this,it is avalible on a 30 day trial from http://www.download.com/3120-20_4-0.html?tg=dl-20&qt=awave&tag=srch\n        however you can only convert one track at a time ,but as you only have one song to do,that wont matter\n        when you have converted the track,it would be a good idea to burn it to dvd or cd using nero7 burning software\n         good luck
Difference between standby and off mode:\n\nIn standby, all peripherals are switched off. That means, the modem, LAN card, speakers, hard-disks, other drives... all of these are switched off. The CPU also goes into a 'low power' mode. But it does use some power.\n\nWhen your computer is switched off... Nothing is switched on and it uses 0 Watt of power.\n\nHowever, certain peripherals are also allowed to bring the computer out of standby mode (notably mouse, keyboard, and anything else that you configure in 'device manager' in windows). For such peripherals, even in standby mode they consume certain amount of power.\n\nHope that helps, otherwise, use a watt-meter!
What are you talking about? Theres already outsourcing going on and most of the ones that are creating this outsourcing are the people from India.\n\nSoon big companies will realize that customer satisfaction is more important to a company. Communication is key when it comes to servicing costumers. When a costumer cant understand what the heck the support person is talking about and if there is a language barrier, then it will turn costumers off. Big companies will realize that spending money on some BETTER sources for costumer support will be key to their business. \n\nI hope we get rid of outsourcing.\n\nI hate it when I'm on the phone with a tech support and they cant speak a word of english...or their accent is so bad, it just angers me more. I refuse to buy their product again if their customer support is THAT bad.

Hi,\n\nThe two processors use totally different CPU (processor) sockets so they are not compatible. In addition, the pinout (the input and output signals) are on different pins on the CPU. There are other reasons outside of the CPU socket and pinout such as the support chipset on the motherboard.\n\nThe easiest thing to do is to verify that you can not get a faster AMD CPU (if you provide more information on your motherboard - make and model #, we can see if a faster CPU will work as the cheapest solution to a new CPU and motherboard). In many cases, the problem is not the speed of the CPU (unless you are a gamer), it is the amount of memory you have, the # of processes starting up at bootup (a lot of those cute little icons in the lower right part of the screen are NOT your friends. They eat up some basic sections of memory that can cause your computer to appear bogged down.).\n\nGeorge
"The seller should still resume sending you your item. If he doesnt, then you can always send in a complaint through ebay and your credit card company to refund you if you do not get your item within 1 month. \n\nYou were too quick to leave a negative feedback. When you leave a negative feedback, you will have to assume you will get one too. Those feedbacks represents your ebay reputation, so you should take that pretty seriously.\n\nUnless the seller refunds you manually, you should still be getting your item.\n\nNOTE: You can always withdraw your feedback by filling in a ""feedback withdrawal"" form through ebay. That way, both your negative feedbacks will get removed."

You can't transfer an iTunes library, but if you plug your iPod into your old computer go to edit --> preferences --> ipod --> manually update, then what happens is you can start plugging your ipod into the new computer and adding new songs while keeping your old ones.

If you are using internet then first of all try to clean temporary internet files by using Windows Explorer -> my computer - > drive c: -> windows -> temporary internet files.\n\n2nd step is remove all unnecessary programs/games from your computer. Remove means you must uninstall thats way it will remove its registries also.\n\n3rd. You can remove registries from \nControl Panel -> Add&remove programs (select properly the programs/games which is not necessary and you are not using or you may have lots of demo versions that is occupying space.\n\n4th run the disk defrag from system tools\n\nafter all these process.\n\nShutdown the computer completely and turn it on. You may see a difference.\n\nThanks.

"By a ""slideshow"" I am guessing that you will have a series of still pictures, with the band music in the background.  If so, a CD will work fine.    It's like a Kodak Picture -CD.  (If you had ""movie"" type video, a DVD would give a much higher quality picture.)\n\nReally, any type of CD will work fine.    I use CD-R  700MB.  They are relatively inexpensive, and no one can accidentally erase your slideshow or  write other data on top of it.   If there are differences between brands, I have not been able to detect it.   I usually use TDK.\n\nMost of the newer DVD players can read picture CD's so you can watch your slideshow on tv's too.\n\nHave fun!"

Curious problem!?\n\nI could not simulate the problem, but then I do not use Matrox card.\n\nAll windows programs use standard X-Y pointers for the top left hard corner of a window. They should be x=0 and y=0 when the screen  is maximized. That is a function of the operating system not Firefox or the video card. I cant imagine something screwing with these settings.\n\nI would see if the problem occurs when using 1024 x 768 screen size mode.\n\nYou may want to make sure you have all the Windows updates.

To answer your first question about having it reformatted. I think that you should definitely reformat it. You don't know how well the other person took care of it, therefore it could be infected with spy-ware and viruses, which will affect the performance of the computer, and some of these will collect information from your computer.\n\nI am assuming that you already have an operating system (Windows 2000, XP)\n\nYou do not need a pro to do this. It is really simple. When you turn on the computer, just insert the CD into the CD-ROM and you will see on the screen a message that says...\n\nPress any key to boot from CD...\n\nAt the following link you will find the steps on how to do that\n\nhttp://www.webtree.ca/windowsxp/clean_install.htm
"You say you have 9.2, but you don't say what kidn of iMac you have.  Is it the original one (the color they called ""Bondi Blue"")?  If so, I think you would be better off taking the money you would spend on OS X and putting it toward a new iMac.  (Or if you can find a monitor somwhere, a Mac Mini, which is even cheaper.)  If it is a later generation iMac, then you will see a big difference with OS X, assuming you have plenty of RAM--at least 512 K.  But I would not spend the money ($129) on the latest version of the OS, which is 10.4.  You can pick up v. 10.3 for less than half that, if you look at eBay and similar sites.  If you decide to go this route, make sure that your buy a copy that is good for all Macs (not the ones that are given with a particular model).  That way you know it will install on your iMac.  Also, if you install 10.3, go to the Apple Web site and download the free upgrades to take it to 10.3.9.\n\nI am writing this on a second-generation G3 iMac, one step newer than the Bondi version, and I am using 10.3.9 But if you can afford it, my main advice is to spend the money on a new computer if your iMac is old.  It is what I will do as soon as I can afford to.\n\nGood luck.  Remember, ""iMac, therefore I Am."" :-)"

Sure. Try using autoruns as an alternative to the built in configuration utility. It lists all the processes that run at startup, and allows you to enable or disable them.\n\nUse at your own risk.

Consider a drive that uses USB in order to keep installation easy. It will also allow you to daisy-chain the devices as your needs increase. Since you mention back up of photos and music I wouldn't start with anything less than 250 GB (gigabytes). That should give you plenty of room to get started and monitor things as your storage increases. I have Western Digital drives which have served me well and ship with Retrospect Back Up software. Look for them at places like CompUSA and TigerDirect.

Cable is the quickest, clocked at about 3 megs. DSL is also around 3 megs, and they are both the same. The difference? Users. Cable is based on how many people use it. The more you have, the faster it is. Talk to people in your neighborhood. If you get mostly cable users, use cable. DSL is more reliable if most don't have cable. They are both fast, but cable will be faster MORE often than DSL,, but keep in mind DSL's variations are smaller than Cable, because somedays cable can be Dial up slow, but others T1 fast.\n\nAlso, Cable is only available is 3 megs, and is expensive. YOu can get 3 levels of DSL, lite (256 Kbps) regular (1400 Kbps) and high speed (3000 Kbps or 3 megs). If you don't need the fastest, DSL is the best choice because it is more cost effective. Regular speed DSL cost me about 40 a month, and Cable runs about 70-80.

Almost without exception, after you delete a program, there are remnants files and registry keys left behind.  In most cases, these files are benign and can be deleted.  However, there are cases in which these are needed by other programs on your computer (eg. shared DLL's).  Deleting these files might cripple these programs.  The safetest thing to do is to create a restore point before deleting them.  If you notice, after deleting, your system is behaving strangely, then you can restore your computer to an early time.  My other suggestion is to try a uninstaller software program.  There are many commerical and free uninstallers available.  These programs delete the undesired program and any files associate with it.  In regards to commercial products, Iolo's System Mechanic is the best I've used thus far. Other good choices include: Symantec Norton's System Works and TuneUp Utilities 2006.  You can find.  However, in regards to free uninstallers, I haven't found any that are on par with the commercial ones.  But, there are some decent ones, including: Easy Uninstaller, MyUninstaller and Zsoft. You can find these items on www.betanews.com.\n\nOn a different note, i recommend you use Disk Cleanup periodically.  To get more hard drive space, consider decreasing the size of the recycle bin and restore points.

You can not convert a file system on a disk without reformatting it, which ever operating system you use. If you're running windows XP Home edition on a FAT 32 file system and want to change the file system to NTFS, you'll have to reformat your PC using a Windows XP CD, which will give you the option of formatting the disk with a specific file system. Personally, I don't advice running windows XP on a FAT 32 file system.

Some like beer, some like wine, some just want a shot of liquor.\n\nIt really depends on your preference. People who love graphical design and likes the MAC interface will prefer MACs. I do admit, I have said in the past I think they are for boys and not Men...but I wasnt being rude about it. I just think the interface is very user friendly and all the features look cartoonish to me. When it comes to PC, they require more hands-on training and they are harder to configure so I think its something men like. Its a low level platform and it takes a person a lot of patience and knowledge to use one....a challenging concept for older generations.\n\nI got used to PCs. Ive had one for more than 10 years now. I used to have a MAC, but I just dont like the interface and the windows architecture on it. I can see why some might like it though. \n\nIts all preference and what youre used to.

To format your harddrive you will need to get a recovery disc or a Windows CD. \nNo boot disc is necessary unless you are trying to install Windows 95. \nThe recovery disc will usually come with your computer, if you dont have one, you will need to call your computer manufacturing company and order one. \nThe recovery disc and the windows CD will partition your harddrive and it will wipe out your memory and start from fresh.\n\nAs soon as you put in the CD and reboot, it should lead you to the setup screen. Its not very hard, you just need to read the steps and follow the screen instructions.\n\nIf you have more questions or need further assistance, just contact me through my profile.

killer,\n\ni would strongly advise you to not buy laptops from other people.  it's just a very risky thing to do; it's nearly impossible to ensure you aren't getting a lemon.\n\nthat said, you can get some pretty cheap laptops if you know where to go.  if you watch dell's website (www.dell.com) for a couple of weeks, you will usually see laptops in the $400 range.  this is probably the cheapest you will find.\n\n$400 to dell buys you a pretty fast machine, most likely with both wired and wireless internet capabilities, along with myriad other features.
Maya. As a former 3DS Max person myself, I found the transition easy. I mean there are hot keys, icon placement, and all that to learn. But it's not really that tough if you have experience with another 3D program, especially Max. I would have to say for ease of use, Max is better. It just seems more user friendly. The biggest problem is that you need a lot of plugins to do all the cool stuff, at least I did. Maya has most of the cool stuff already in the program, but it is harder to work with. It's not really much harder, just a slightly steeper learning curve. In the end, I would say it is good to know both if you plan to have a job in the field of 3D modeling or animation. Makes your resume look a lot better.

you need to completely wipe the hard drive and reinstall Microsoft (i'm assuming thats what you have) after installing windows. install McAfee or Norton (although I found McAfee to be a lot better protection) I would also install a pop up blocker (I use Ad ware and Spybot, they work really well) then continue installing windows updates then everything else onto your computer.\ndon't plug into the net unless you have to, until after you've installed McAfee.

"Hello,\n\nYou have to check for the event WM_COMMAND in your switch instruction. And inside that case, check the wParam value (High order byte) of the event to make sure it is a BN_CLICKED event. At that stage, you need to further identify your button using the wParam (Low order byte) of the wParam.\n\nExample:\n\n        case WM_COMMAND: \n          if (HIWORD(wParam) == BN_CLICKED) \n          { \n                switch (LOWORD(wParam)) \n                { \n                    case ID_OF_YOUR_BUTON: \n                        MessageBox(hwnd, ""Hello"", ""Testing"", MB_OK);\n \n                        break; \n                } \n          } \n          break; \n\n\nI suggest that you take a look to the doc of VC++ on these events, mainly in the Windows SDK doc about Buttons. It is well done with code samples.\n\nAdditional note: as you created your button directly on a window instead of within a dialog box, it is very likely that you used a call to the CreateWindow function to create it. In this case, you give the ID number in parameter HMENU hMenu of the function. You may create a Resource ID (it is just an value globally defined with #define) to avoid playing with numbers when you have several controls.\n\nRegards,\nChris.\nhttp://www.beinsoft.com"

It looks like two sets of languages:\nC#, VB,net (and closely related MS tech).\n-- or --\nJAVA and related tech.\n\nFew places need both - most are either Java shops or MS shops.

Suggest asp.net or php plus html/css/javascript (the usual stuff).\n\nIf your use the keyword 'developer' in a monster.com or workopolis (career search sites) search, you can get a good idea of what's hot.

There are about 1.5 billion emails being sent around the around EVERYday. 70% of them are spam mails. The only thing we can do is try to ignore them and report them as spam mail. The problem with spam mail is that people just delete them, they dont report them. Everytime you get a spam mail, you can report it so that your ISP or Firewall or Security Suite can find out how they can block those mails. The more spam mail you send them, the better they can filter them out. It is very difficult to try and block every spam mail existing out there, but I think if everyone shows effort to report them, then maybe theres a chance that they can improve the security to block them. There might be emails that you get that I dont get, but I might get them a few months later. If your email helps block future spam emails, then it will help so much....it would be like a domino effect. \n\nThats the role we need to play. We need to report them and act like spam patrols and help eliminate them once and for all. We shouldnt just ignore them and delete them....its easier to point and click than to report the problem. However, its not going to help us fight against global spam either.
Everything.

the laptop should be fine to play music but laptops arent good for gaming as they dont have dedicated VGA cards in them...high end laptops do but a gamer will tell you why spend $5000 on a gaming laptop when $900 for a really decent VGA card in a desktop system will do the job much better.
Hi the questions above are so absurd.\n\nYes, I like the way your thinking and it is the correct way of thinking. A static header is always better to have. BUT don't think it will save users time. \n\nWhen you visit a website, the cache is stored on your system, so the page is saved, the photos cached. But there are two ways which you could do what you want. A better way is to leave them static.\n\nIf your using a dynamic scripting language like PHP/ASP/JSP/Etc. Then you can create a header.php and a index.php and a footer.php.\nWithin the index.php you will say include(header.php); and you have your body and then have include(footer.php); That is how every popular website uses. Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/ Myself :)\n\nYou don't have to worry about the header and footer since they don't change. But if you want to just reload the body on each link, then an alternative to frames would be using Javascript.\n\nJavascript has AJAX, then when you click on a link or an area you can tell it to load a portion of the page only.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX\n\nFrames are depreciated for website programming. They are not used for a method like yours. They are used for other instnaces. But in your case it is not good to do it that way. \n\nAJAX is the new buzz word which many people are using. It takes time to learn but it is powerfull. Imagine clicking on a link and only one portion of the page reloads :) That is nice \n\nGood Luck.
The resolution is set by the video card, but the monitor should be able to display it.\n\nTo set a desired screen resolution, right click on the desktop and choose properties.  Then the Settings tab.  There will be a slider switch to change the resolution.

If your clients are just serving up static websites, a Celeron will do. Go for the memory for sure.\n\nI agree that a Celeron is an odd choice for a professional server; but it really depends on your application. If your clients are just dentists who have websites with some cute photos and their telephone number, then a Celeron could provide hundreds of these clients just fine.\n\nIf your clients have any sort of server side processing (checkout carts; SQL-driven blogs; etc.), just pay the extra few bucks to get a better processor.

PHP has a operator that allows the user to join two variables together. And that operator is a dot (.)\n\nSo if you have this: \n==============================\n<?php\n$disp = 'Hi ';\n$disp .= 'm0';\nprint $disp;\n?>\n==============\n\nThe above will print:\nHi m0\n\nWhen we say equal it is intializing that variable to that. like\n====\n$a = 1;\n$b = 2;\n====\nSo if I print out a it will be 1 or if I prinf out b it will be 2.\n\nIf I say:\n====\n$a = 1;\n$c = $a.'3';\nprint $c;\n====\nThat will print out  13\n\nYou could have other forms of operators such as:\n===\n$a =1;\n$a += 2;\n=== \na will print out 3 since (a += b) is the same as   a = a + b;\n\nThe correct word for it would be concatentation between variables, the other operators like - or + are only valid for numbers integers.\n\nGood luck on your quest.

Well the first thing to do is not to reply to those emails and not to download any attachments.\n\nOn most of the free email sites, you have to option to report emails as spam. Spammers actually use random email addresses to tranmit viruses, so it everytime you might get an email from a different email address and is very difficult to get rid of it completely. I am sure that you have the same option with MSN to report emails as spams and this way you can reduce such email and not completely eliminate them depending on the type of email you get and from where.

Pretty sure CTO is 'config-to-order'; a term used mostly for hardware items (desktops, notebooks) on special large bids and/or for government orders. Could also be used for large items that are built only if ordered (i.e. Powerware $10,00+ backup units). Suspecting this is what they're referring to on the SW license side, although first I've heard of 'CTO software' before...

Select View or change existing email accounts\n4. Highlight the account in question and click the Change button\n5. Click the More settings button\n6. Click the Advanced tab\n7.

"PR6 (or PR0 to PR10) refers to the PageRank Display on the Google Toolbar http://www.google.com/support/toolbar/bin/static.py?page=features.html&hl=en and according to Google tells you ""... how Google's algorithms assess the importance of the page you're viewing"".\n\nProfessional SEOs refer to it as Toolbar PR or TPR to differentiate it from the PageRank formulated by Google's Brin and Page in this paper http://www-db.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html which can have non integer values outside the range 0-10.\n\nThe relationship between PR and TPR is assumed to be logarithmic but outside of a few engineers in Google no one knows the exact relationship or even if there is any direct relationship at all. \n\nBecause PageRank is keyword independent the search engine results pages are not in TPR order and pages with a lower TPR will often rank higher than pages with a higher TPR for any given search term.\n\nBecause of those things and the fact that TPR is only updated every 3 months or so it is only of interest to the lower echelons of the SEO community and completely disregarded by the professional SEOs.\n\nI advise you to disregard it as well and concentrate or more important metrics."

Actually, Ask the Planet is just a contest to promote the Yahoo! Answers site. It's not actually the site itself. And, yes, I have learned many things. I did so much researching when I started out months ago, though, that I'm now spending a lot of time answering similar questions to what I've already gone over, but I still find some great questions that are fun doing a little bit of research for.\n\nThe best part is getting answers from other people, though. Sometimes I get responses on here that any regular online research wouldn't be able to get me because these are people who happened to have first-hand experience about something which doesn't have as much documentation online. I enjoy adding a little something about my own personal experiences every once in a while because I feel that's what contributes the most to Yahoo! Answers.

"The only way you can ""copy"" it is to have your hard drive ""cloned"" in the new computer (i.e. a direct 1to1 image of your old drive will be copyied using a software like Ghost or Drive image to your new drive). Just a copy/paste process won't do.\n\nOr you can search for the install CD and reinstall, so all the files go into their (right) places and the necessary info is written in the Windows' registry.\n\nI would say the first method is best, because it takes just a few minutes and it brings you all the other applications you installed, not to mention also the O.S. and all your personal data and settings!

For something to be multimedia it must simply contain more than one form of media. Generally something containing both audio and video would be considered multimedia, so yes, computer games would fall under that category.

"Bit Torrents are different than P2P programs you are probably more familiar with.  The program that you download (probably from bittorent.com) only manages downloads.  You don't search for files with it, you just give it a very small file and it uses that to find places to get bits and pieces of the file so transfers are fast.  \n\nSearch on Yahoo! for ""torrent search"" and you will get a lot of torrent search engines to find what you are looking for.  Download the torrent file and then open it with Bit Torrent.  It will do the rest.  \n\nMost torrent sites require you to do a certain share ratio, so be sure to leave your torrents running when you are done downloading or you could have trouble downloading in the future.\n\nAlso, just for legality's sake, make sure you have permission to download whatever it is you are looking for ;)"

Then say to your mom, that buying a laptop, even a cheap one, and a router, that will allow him to be on the laptop doing his thing and someone else on the main computer.  Also, with a router, you are able to limit the time he spends on the internet, what time he can get on the internet, and even what sites he gets on, all of which can be blocks be a password for only the parents knowing.

"spyware/anti-spyware is just a file in your computer. If you want the file on a CD, then just burn it like you would do a normal data file. You can use any program from http://www.download.com that lets you burn backup data or file data to a CD, as long as you have a CD burner. You just open the program, drag and drop the spyware file you want to save, and then you hit the ""record"" or ""burn"" button, depending on what application you use. Normally all computers that have a CD burner usually comes with its own CD copying or backup software so you might actually have one in your program files.\n\nFor step by step: \nlook for the program in your C drive. You might still have the .exe file that lets you install it into your computer. If so, you just need to burn the .exe file. Or you can just look for the program in your C:&#92;program files directory. You can compress the whole folder if you want to make it smaller. Then just copy the entire folder into your Disc. There might be some registry keys that are setup during the setup process so you might want to copy those too. Also, most antispyware programs can be located online. If you just go directly to the company's website, you might be able to download it again. All you would need is the ""key"" if they require one. You could probably just call them up and ask them to re-send you the key."

"A program by definition requires ram/cpu threads. Any program you choose will ""slow"" down your system and hog resources. I'm assuming you're reffering to the iTunesHelper.exe process that runs while iTunes is not active?\n\nThe great thing about Mac programmers is that they know what they're doing. That process is designed to relinquish ram when it's needed. So while your system is idle, it's ram usage will increase, under load or stress it will drop it's consumption.\n\nSome alternatives to iTunes are WinAmp, though it can be a bit of a resource hog too, Windows Media Player (naturally), those two together might be able to occupy about 80% of itunes function 'out of the box'.\n\nIf you're music Library is large, you'll probably want to stick with iTunes, as it handles a large library better than WMP or WinAmp."

Unless corrections are made, orbits are usually elliptical; perigee is the point on the orbit closest to the earth, and apogee is the point farthest from the earth. Besides this eccentricity an orbit of a satellite about the earth is characterized by its plane with respect to the earth. \n\nAn equitorial orbit lies in the plane of the earth's orbit. A polar orbit lies in the plane passing through both the north and south poles. A satellite's period (the time to complete one revolution around the earth) is determined by its height above the earth; the higher the satellite, the longer the period. At a height of 200 mi (320 km), the period of a circular orbit is 90 min; at 500 mi (800 km), it increases to 100 min. At a height of 22,300 mi (36,000 km), a satellite has a period of exactly 24 hr, the time it takes the earth to rotate once on its axis; such an orbit is called geosynchronous. If the orbit is also equatorial, the satellite will remain stationary over one point on the earth's surface.

It is the memory of your computer that you can store large amount of data and it will keep it in there until you want access to them. It is internal, but it can also be external. Your local harddrive is normally your local memory thats internal and it might have stored your O.S (for example, Windows XP, Windows 98, Windows NT) and other programs that you have stored into it. It is generally referenced as your C: drive.\n\nAlso, the hard drive goes by different memories. The bigger the memory, the more you can store things in your computer like programs and games.

First of all, it's not a display of your CPU. It's you powering up your system.\n\nIt could be a number of scenarios:\n1. Something is wrong with your RAM (A good indication of this is if your computer beeps as soon as it starts up and a blank screen remains).\n2. Your motherboard could be fried (Odds of that are low since you claim to have monitor signal, revealing that your video card is fine).\n3. Your CPU is fried. Only real way to check this is to find another motherboard compatible with your CPU and test it.\n4. Your CMOS battery is dead. Replace it.\n\nFrom my past experience, #3 and #4 are your most likely scenarios in this case. Hopefully it's only #4 that's the problem.\n\nGood luck.

"The answer to your question depends a bit on whom you ask :-P\n\nTiVo has stated they wouldn't support TiVoToGo on Mac OS, but following the introduction of the video iPod, that position seemed to change.  Now the rumor is TiVoToGo for Mac will arrive ""mid 2006"".\n\nIn the mean time, some folks have gotten TiVoToGo to work under VirtualPC (with some difficulty.)  The new Intel Macs can run Windows even better than the PowerPC ones could under Virtual PC (either under Parallels or via Boot Camp), so it might be possible to hack together a work-around.

Different browsers render a little differently.  Some html is not recognized by all browsers.  It is very common for sites to not render correctly in Firefox because it is less tolerant to errors in the html.  Most likely, the code was not written well or not written to accommodate browsers other than IE that don't recognize certain pieces of html code that IE does.  I can't even access the sites I have to use in my job from Firefox.  They don't play well together.\n\nNot all webpages should show up poorly, though.  Something big like Yahoo or Google should be well written to work well with Firefox.

As you know, computer is just a machine. It knows only machine language which we don't know to speak or use ;)  So simply, booting means, loading the Operating System in to the computer's memory so that after loading, it know what to do if we press the mouse button...it know what to do if we press any keys in the keyboard... it know what to do if we double click somewhere over any icons etc.\n\nSo booting is a process of loading the Operating System (whatever you use - windows, linux, macos, dos...) in to the computer's main memory. This operating system is the mediator between the computer hardware and the computer user.
you need to have a server and there you need to load all the pc games and your 8 pc's you need to put up a shortcut file that the target is all in your server.

"You need to set up home networking on your computer.  If you are running windows xp you can use your setup CD to do this.

Also you need to remember you have to have the computer that the printer is plugged into booted up and running for the printer to work from another computer.\n\nHope it helps"
create a folder..call it what you will...before the actual download it will ask where to send it to that folder..If your syatem is running right it will ask do you want to save or open. open It in that same folder. Then go to your printer and when it asks for disk or software send it to the folder you created to find the inf file the system should setup on its own now!

Well you can hack back... but not legally. What you need to do is change your account or change your password to something better. If you can get an IP address of the person you can trace it back to their provider and notify them that someone with that IP address is hacking your accounts. Also notify the FBI.\n\nBelow is a link that will trace the IP address.
I do hope that you're referring to phone technicians.\n\nPersonally, I avoid telling customers to reinstall as much as possible. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should need to reformat their machine over a virus. Absolutely none.\n\nViruses are the easiest to blame though because everyone knows what a virus is. If a phone tech tells you that you have malware or spyware, it's going to raise a lot of questions from you about removing it that he may not be capable of answering.\n\nPhone techs are paid by the call btw, not by the answers given.
That seems like a really large image. No way you can reduce the resolution or size of that? If not you may be able to split the image up front to make two or four smaller images, read them in, then piece together for processing. I would think you could do that with code to just divide the file content into even chunks. Or can you setup a buffer to read in a set size like 10 megs, then keep reading in 10 megs at a time till the whole file is read in? Sorry, I haven't actually had to handle images this large before but I think you may have to reduce the file size or handle it in pieces as opposed to one big chunk.
.ram files are played with Realplayer which is a product of RealNetworks. Realplayer is freeware. You can download it from the company website or any of the download sites.

Check how much RAM you have. Anything below 250MB and youll have trouble. AS the others mentioned, also check and see how the graphics are set up. IF you have factory graphics, the computer will use part of your RAM for video, which can compund the 'not enough memory' problem. I would suggest looking into upgrading one or both of the above.

"i finally noticed your email address. your invite is on the way. ignore my other email.\n\nHere is some information that will help you with GMail.\n\nNOTE: THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! GMAIL IS STILL BEING BETA TESTED SO THE PART YOU FIRST SEE WHEN YOU FIRST LOGIN ISN""T WORKING CORRECTLY YET. NOT ALL OF THE FEATURES IN THAT SECTION HAVE BEEN ADDED YET. AT THE VERY TOP YOU WILL SEE A LINK THAT SAYS ""STANDARD VIEW"" CLICK ON IT TO GET TO THE WORKING PART OF GMAIL.\n\nOne of the best features is how easy it is to keep up with a conversation with a single friend. All of your previous posts to that\nperson are right there for you to review in case you forgot what you were talking about. Another good feature is that everyone that emails you is automatically added into your contacts list (address book). Currently there is no way to opt out of that. Maybe later they will add that feature.\n\nGMail is currently in beta testing and isn't ready to be released to the general public. This is why you had to be invited to use it instead of just signing up for it like you would normally do with everything else. Because it is still being tested it will occasionally not do what you want it to do. When this happens keep trying until it gives up and report it to one of the following GMail Help groups below.\n\nUsually after a week or two you will be given the ability to invite others to Gmail. You will know when the time comes because a form will appear in the lower-left corner of your screen. Also when answering an email you will see a link that says ""Invite So And So To Gmail"". So and so is the name of the person you are emailing.\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-Discussion\n\nhttp://groups-beta.google.com/group/Gmail-Generation\nhttp://s90215429.onlinehome.us/sjvilla79/content/gg-faq.html\n\nOther helpful GMail links.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail\nhttp://email.about.com/od/gmail/\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=gmail&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N\n\nPLUS ADDRESSING\n\nGmail also supports ""plus-addressing"" of emails. Messages can be sent to addresses in the form: gmail.user+extratext@gmail.com where extratext can be any string. Plus-addressing allows users to sign up for different services with different aliases and then easily filter all e-mails from those services. It does not appear, however, that the +string feature works when sending email from a gmail account to itself. Additionally (in some cases) the string appended to the e-mail address may not be longer than six characters. Below is an example.\nfred@gmail.com and fred+amazon+shopping will send email to the same inbox."
The longer you leave it, the longer it'll take to defrag. If you do it once a week as people are recommending it'll be a quick and hassle free job. You can leave it longer quite safely but it's good advice. Also do the disc clean up BEFORE the defrag. There's no point wasting time defraging files you're going to be getting rid of anyway.

The next step is to get a hosting service, like Yahoo! Small Business, which I use, but there are lots of others. Then you need to either use a webpage builder program like Dreamweaver, FrontPage, or something like those then upload the pages to your hosting service. Or you can write the HTML code yourself. I've done both, but I Dreamweaver is the best program in my opinon and it's expensive so I stick to writing the HTML myself.\n\nIt helps a lot if you know a little about HTML even when you use programs like Dreamweaver and Front Page. After a few years of teaching myself I finally broke down and bought this book:\n\nhttp://www.cookwood.com/html5ed/\n\nIt helped a lot in my understanding of the structure and functions of the HTML codes I was using. I also do a lot of cut and paste too, though! JavaScript is tricky! And I can't stand most Flash sites, even though they look really cool most of the time it's just more than what is needed.\n\nSorry I can't give you more help than that - it's not really an easy thing to sum up since it does require a little knowledge if you want a really good, nice-looking, well-organized site.\n\nhttp://www.clicksandwhistles.com/index2.html\n\nThat's what I was able to do with my knowledge. (I haven't updated it in a loooooong time though). It's really just a glorified resume, but it's nice to have something for potential employers to look at online.

Select a location on the D drive.\n\nIn my computer click on the drive and select properties. and then click the disk clean up button( i'll bet you knew that  already).\n\nLast but not least, create another partion using some of the free space on your big drive, then format it from administrative tools > disk management and select to mount it as a folder on your C drive.

Usually, only one USB port on a laptop is 2.0 compliant, you have to find out which one it is. Also, if you are putting anything between the USB port on the computer and the USB drive, like an external HUB, make sure that IT is 2.0 compliant. Plugging a 1.1 HUB into  2.0 port makes it all run at 1.1, thus anything you connect that is 2.0 will bring up that message.\n\nLastly, go into the device manager and look to see in USB devices if there is a USB 2.0 driver listed there, if not then contact the laptop manufacturer to see if they can help you get it back.

"I'd love to help you, but I'm not sure what you're looking for.  Part of the problem, perhaps, is that while I'm a good computer programmer with 12+ years programming in C++ I'm really lousy with finances and I'm not sure I could work out interest by hand.\n\nBut even if I could, it makes no sense to develop this as a class if you don't have either related functions or persistant data.  I can't envision this taking more than one function to implement unless you stretch it some.  But if you were to stretch it, try this:\n\nclass InterestCalculator\n{\npublic:\n   InterestCalculator()  {SetRate(0.05);}\n   void SetRate(double r) {Rate = r;}   //Add error checking here\n   double CalcInterest(double money, int months);\n\nprivate:\n   double Rate;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\nInterestCalculator calc;\n\ncalc.SetRate(0.10); //set rate to 10 percent;\n\ncout << ""$500 for two years at a 10% rate has an interest of "" << calc.CalcInterest(500, 24) << endl;\n}\n\nNow, that's a rather contrived solution, designed to use a class even where it makes little sense to do so.  I don't know if this helps or not. I've left the implementation of calculating the interest rate to you (as I said, I'm not sure how to do it even by hand).\n\nIf you have more information on what else the class should do so that it makes more sense as a class, modify your question here or shoot me an e-mail and I'll see what help I can be.\n\nGood luck."

No.  There's no substitute for a quality anti-virus and spyware protector that you manage yourself.  If you're looking for a good FREE program of each variety, try Anti-Vir (http://www.free-av.com/) and Spybot (http://www.safer-networking.org/en/download/).

"An emoticon, also called a smiley, is a sequence of ordinary printable ASCII characters, such as :-), ;o), ^_^ or :-(, or a small image, intended to represent a human facial expression and convey an emotion. Emoticons are a form of paralanguage commonly used in e-mail messages, in online bulletin boards, online forums, instant messengers, or in chat rooms, without them simple statements could be misinterpreted. Sometime during 1981, Scott Fahlman (now a Principle Research Scientist in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University), devised a scheme for encoding and conveying one's feelings in small text ""glyphs"" to overcome this frustration.\n\nLook up emoticon in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.The word emoticon is a portmanteau which popular etymology bases on emotion and icon. A similar portmanteau, verticon (based on vertical and (i?)con), is sometimes used when referring to the East Asian style of emoticon.\n\nThe smile is represented with a basic smiley :-). The colon represents the eyes, the hyphen is for the nose, and the parenthesis is for the mouth.\n\nMany variants exist with different symbols substituted for the basic ones. The symbol for the nose is often omitted, for example :) or ;). When the colon is replaced with the equals sign, =), the nose is almost always omitted (so one would not see =-), for example)."

G'day,\n\nA few things come in minds.\n1. Try to download the latest driver/software for your wireless set from the manufacturer's website.  Make sure you uninstall the old driver/software before installing the new one.\nIf the previous suggestion does not work there are 2 possibilities as follows:\n2a. You may have a corrupted Operating System (I assume you are using Windows XP).  You may need to reformat your HDD and reinstall your operating system from scratch.  Please refer to some answers in Yahoo Answers about reformatting HDD and make sure you back up your data files before doing so.  This is gonna be a major work if you want to take this way\n2b. Pls dun get offended, but you might buy a cheap brand wireless set. I helped a few of my clients installing cheap/unknown wireless set that they bought themselves and it gives me alot of problems.  Once I suggest them to exchange with well-known brands wireless set (eg. Microsoft or Logitech), the hardware works perfectly without any problems.  So you may want to try this option first before reformatting HDD.\n\nHope this helps.  Good Luck :)

"Yahoo is web based e-mail, unless you pay for POP through Yahoo called ""Mail Plus"", available for $20/month. Just in case you don't know, POP is where the e-mail is downloaded to your compuer, but web-mail is stored on the server on the web. You can usually view POP mail through the web, but it doesnt work the other way around.\n\nSolution: sign up for POP access. This will allow that cool e-mail feature to work. You can do that through your ISP for free, Yahoo and MSN charge a little bit. I use Bluebottle (it's free!) Then set up Mail according to the e-mail server settings."
I am going to school for my MBA right now and that is actually a topic of discussion we had last semester in one of my classes.  That is a trend that I believe will continue.  Chat rooms and blogs have become mainstream. Consumers are tired of pop up advertising therefore, the only other way to make money off of the service is to charge for it. I personnaly, would not pay for it, but I am not much of a chat room type of person.

Here is one of the best ways:\n1.Go to ""www.learnem.com""\n2.At the bottom of the page you will see this ad:\n  ""Web Design in 7 days""\n3.Click the ""click here"" for download and you will be directed Cnet downloads site where you can read comments about this e-book, and also you can download it for free.\n4.Once you finish download follow the instructions, open the programme. It can be opened by Adobe Acrobat Reader (you probably have on your computer, if not you can download it for free). \n5. Follow the instructions in the programme. Because it is Adobe text, you can not cheat by copy and paste, you will have to write your programs yourself.\nI'm sure you will learn how to create your own website, and you will enjoy it.\n Best luck"

Use Adobe Photo Shop, Print Shop Plus, or Paint. Paint is located under Programs&#92;Accessories, or any other software you might have. Create 2 file folders in the program you chose. Copy the 'full' image into each folder. Open the first folder, determine your 'exact' center-line and erase 1/2 half of the image. Click file and save. Open the other folder, erase the 'other' half of the image and save. Open the first folder, and do your print command. This will print the first half of the image. Open the other folder and again do the print command. This will give you prints of the total image on 2 sheets.

Podcasting is the method of distributing multimedia files, such as audio programs or music videos, over the Internet using either the RSS or Atom syndication formats, for playback on mobile devices and personal computers. The term podcast like 'radio', can mean both the content and the method of delivery. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster. Podcasters' web sites may also offer direct download or streaming of their files; a podcast however is distinguished by its ability to be downloaded automatically using software capable of reading RSS or Atom feeds.\n\nUsually a podcast features one type of 'show', with new episodes released either sporadically or at planned intervals such as daily or weekly. In addition, there are podcast networks that feature multiple shows on the same feed.\n\nPodcasting's essence is about creating content (audio or video) for an audience that wants to listen or watch when they want, where they want, and how they want.\n\n\n: )

"Excel is the spreadsheet that comes with Microsoft Office.\n\nA spreadsheet is, at its most basic, a grid of boxes where you can enter numbers and equations.  Each box (called a cell) has a specific address, based on the row number and the column.  The first cell is A1, the one below it is A2, and the one to the right of it is B1.  Pretty simple so far, right?\n\nKnowing no more than this, you can use Excel as nothing more than a convenient editor for tabular data.  In fact, this is primarily what Excel is for... except instead of just putting in tabular data it can also calculate the data for you.\n\nHere's an example:  I had a garage sale recently and recorded each sale in the spreadsheet. It was pretty simple.  (Actually, I'm lying to you.  It was a complex spreadsheet that tracked a lot of different things like donor, category, and sales goals, but I'm simplifying it for this answer.  It COULD have been a simple spreadsheet).  \n\nIn the 'A' column I listed the item that was sold.  In the B column I listed the price of the item.  A ways down the B column--say row 100--I put an equation in by typing ""=sum(B1:B99)"" which meant to add up all the numbers in the cells from B1 to B99.  Now I had a functional spreadsheet that automatically updated the total sold so far.  Any time I typed in a new purchase, BAM!  There was the new total.  A lot easier than adding it up on paper, no?\n\nThis is basically what a spreadsheet is.  It can format numbers as percentages, dollar amounts, etc.  Basic math works like ""=A5+B6"" or ""=C12+10"" and so forth--each cell's address can be treated as a variable in the equation, and you can type in literal numbers as well..  The more common equations (average, total, etc) have buttons for them on the top.  For the more advanced ones I usually recommend choosing ""function"" from the insert menu.\n\nYou'd be surprised what excel can do.  It's pretty simple on the surface, but has tremendous power beneath.  \n\nI hope this answered your question.  Good luck to you."

I hope what you want is here. Personally I would not change it. I gives you a chance to consider whether or not it is a good idea to allow the active x download. Some are very dangerous.\n\nWith Internet Explorer security zones, you can specify security options for Web content. A zone is a collection of Web sites to which you assign the same level of trust. You add a Web site to a specific zone and then set the appropriate security options for that zone.\n\nYou can adjust the Internet Explorer default settings to best match the security features of your system. For a secure intranet, for example, you can usually adjust the security setting to Low or an appropriate custom setting (after the Local intranet zone is configured to match the firewall).\n\nAll security options apply to the Internet Explorer browser; they are not system-wide. Other Internet programs may or may not respect these options.\n\nTo set corporate security options, you must modify the settings by using the IEAK. The user views security options in the browser by clicking the Tools menu, clicking Internet Options, and then clicking the Security tab. To see custom settings, the user selects a security zone and then clicks Custom Level.\n\nTop of page\nActiveX controls and plug-ins\nThese options control how ActiveX controls and plug-ins are administrator-approved, downloaded, run, and scripted. For more information about managing and approving ActiveX controls, see Managing ActiveX Controls.\n\nWhen a user downloads an ActiveX control from a site different than the site the control is used on, Internet Explorer uses the more restrictive of the two sites' zone settings. For example, if a user is viewing a Web page within a zone that is set to allow (Enable) a download, but the code is downloaded from another zone that is set to prompt the user first, then the prompt setting is used.\n\nScript ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting\nThis option determines whether an ActiveX control marked safe for scripting can interact with a script. Note that safe-for-initialization controls loaded with PARAM tags are not affected by this option. This option is ignored when Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe is set to Enable because the setting bypasses all object safety. You cannot script unsafe controls while blocking the scripting of the safe ones.\n\nInitialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe\nActiveX controls are classified as being either safe or unsafe. This option controls whether or not a script is allowed to interact with unsafe controls. Unsafe controls are not meant for use on Internet Web pages, but in some cases may be used with pages that can absolutely be trusted not to use the controls in a malicious way. Object safety should be enforced unless all ActiveX controls and scripts that might interact with pages in this zone can be trusted. The settings are as follows:\n\nRun ActiveX controls and plug-ins\nThis option determines whether ActiveX controls and plug-ins can be run on pages from the specified zone. Disabling this option prevents running any ActiveX controls or plug-ins; therefore, the other ActiveX settings are ignored. Downloading, running, and scripting ActiveX controls are three distinct steps with options that apply to each separate step. Downloading options distinguish between signed and unsigned controls. Scripting options can be set for safe and unsafe controls separately. Whether a control is safe for scripting (or initialization) is determined by the control author and should not be confused with signing; signing and safety are independent. For more information, see the MSDN Online Web Workshop.\n\nDownload signed ActiveX controls\nThis option allows users to download signed ActiveX controls from pages in this zone. The settings are as follows:\n\n• Enable lets users silently download any signed controls.\n \n• Prompt displays a warning before users download controls signed by publishers that are 
Well, this task is very easily done if you have Microsoft Office (usually comes with the software bundle from MDG computers). All you need to do is open up Microsoft PowerPoint and use the Slideshow wizard to get you started. PowerPoint is all about making slide shows with text, sounds, videos, and pictures. And after about an hour or so and twiddling with the features, you'll be all set for making your presentation. Best of all, most school computers have PowerPoint on them so you can send your ppt file from home and open it up at school to present.

"his is where we come in and try to lend a hand by providing to some of our novice users a few pointers about installing the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.\n\nBefore beginning the installation please make sure you have collected all of the important disks received when the computer was purchased, which basically means driver disks for: motherboard, audio, video, network adapter (if you have one) and S-ATA (if you have a S-ATA hard disk). If you are installing Windows XP without Service Pack 2, remove your network cable before commencing. Also, if you are reinstalling Windows, please make sure you have moved all important files from your Desktop, My Documents, Program Files and Windows folders.\n\nNow you can start your computer and enter its BIOS (usually by pressing the Delete button). Search for the boot priority section (it should be in the first menu or in Advanced BIOS Featues) and make sure the first boot device is the CD-ROM drive. Now you can insert the Windows XP installation CD in your optical drive and exit the BIOS (Not without saving of course).\n\nYour computer will restart and after a few seconds will ask you to press a key so it can boot from the CD. Press any key to start the Windows XP installation process. After inspecting your computer, you will be asked to press the F6 key if you have a disk for your S-ATA hard drive. It is very important not to skip or miss this\nstep if you do have an S-ATA hard drive!\n\nIf you have pressed the F6 key, you will be asked to specify your storage controller. Hit the S key, insert the S-ATA driver disk and press Enter. After copying the needed drivers, you will see to the previous screen again. Just press Enter and let the setup process continue.\n\nWhen the setup has finished loading files, you will have to choose between setting up Windows, repair an existing Windows installation and exiting the setup. You will of course press the Enter key which brings you to the License Agreement screen. You can agree by pressing F8 or disagree by pressing the Escape key (this will stop the installation process).\n\nThe next screen is a partition manager; it will display available partitions and unused space on your hard drive. You can create a partition by pressing C, delete one by press D or use the arrow keys to select the partition on which Windows XP will be installed. We do not advise you to delete partitions if you do not know exactly what this means. If the selected partition already has Windows installed on it, you will have to choose between using the same partition for your installation and deleting the old Windows (press L) or using another partition (press Escape). If the hard drive doesn’t have any partitions (only unused space), you must create one: just press C and choose the partition size. After selecting a partition, the setup will ask you to format the selected partition. If you’ve just created the partition or if it doesn’t store any valuable information, you can use the quick NTFS format, but if the partition already existed and if you have important files stored on in it, you can choose to ""Leave the current file system intact (no changes)"".\n\nThe setup will now start copying files and then reboot and install devices (please note that user intervention is not needed in any way, you might as well leave the computer alone until the setup finishes device installation). You have surely noticed that the device installation has began in a new, more user friendly interface and when it’s over a window will appear requesting you to modify your Regional and Language Settings. To help certain services provide you with local information, you may choose your country in Location menu. By pressing Customize you can select number settings (decimal symbol, digit grouping, negative sign symbol, measurement system, etc), currency settings (currency symbol, decimal symbol, etc), time settings (time format, time separator) and date settings (short date format"

The first thing you have to do is go to a website that has everything you could possibly think of to put on your page: background, cursor, contact box, online now image, glitter graphics, music, etc.  www.toxxic.net, www.mynicespace.com, and www.createblog.com (which is my favorite because almost everything is all ready set up for you) are just a few. Now on www.mynicespace.com, to the left are all the links you need to customize your page. When you go to backgrounds for example, you can scroll down to pick one you like and be sure to look at all the pages.  After you've chosen one, under it you will find an html code to that background and you simply highlight it and copy it. Then you have to go to your myspace account and click home, then click on edit profile, then on the about me section paste the html code, click on preview section and you should see the different background you added, finally click on save. It is basically the same routine for everything else. I hope this helps you have a pretty homepage. Email me at www.silverprincess925@yahoo.com if you get stuck on something or want more information.

Well, from the tech specs on Intel.com, it looks like you have only one PCI expansion slot.  Since you have no AGP or PCIe slots, you are not going to be able to get the best performing graphics cards on the market right now as they work with those two slot types.\n\nThat being said, I prefer NVIDIA for all of my graphics cards.  That is just my personal preference.  They perform well and are relatively inexpensive.  I have the AGP form of the BFG GeForce 5500 in my computer and it serves my needs quite well.  They have a PCI version of it as well that i would suggest you going with.  The motherboard that oyu have seems a little old, but it should work wih it as long as you get the right drivers, which you may have to get online as I do not know if those proper drivers will come with the card.  You can get it for about $55.00 plus shipping and handling from tigerdirect.com.  If you want to go with ATI though you can get the Radeon 9250 at the same site for about $75.00

"OK little'un.  From a parent who ""trusts"" a kid online.\n\nThe ONLY way a caring parent will trust you online with blogs or IM .. or myspace is if they have the tools to easilly monitor what you are doing online.\n\nIt is NOT just a matter of trust, it is a matter of SAFETY to a parent who cares.  I know that a parent who cares is a real PAIN .. but you should be thankful, many kids don't have a parent who cares one iota.\n\nThere are many tools out there, some are low cost or free, the better ones cost a some bucks.  One of these tools, once they are loaded on your computer, keep track of EVERYTHING you do on your computer.  Your parent can come in at their leisure (even online from work in some cases) to check what emails you have sent or received, view complete conversations that you have held online, view EVERY web site you visit.  Some of these tools even allow the parent to set time limits on your internet access.  (yes, Johnny, the web is addicting, IM is addicting and you can waste your entire life before you know it on the WWW)\n\nI know this is not the most exciting thing for a youngster to contemplate, having a parent know EVERYTHING you are doing online.... but .. for a parent who cares .. it may well be the ONLY way they will allow you to get online and experience the whole universe of the web ... safely.\n\nAs long as you are careful, only enguage in proper conversations, NEVER give ANY personal information over the internet that could identify you. Your parent will be happy with your web access .. including IM.\n\nI had used a product called I AM BIG BROTHER several years ago .. I know there are much better products out there now.  A web search should quickly turn up a dozen or so parental monitoring tools that your parent might accept.\n\nGood luck."

I just got one today from CareerBuilder.com I was looking for them online when I found your question. Sounds too good to be true. Maybe bad guys, it says they are from Greece.
What kind of designer are you? Photo, video, cad?\n\nIf you're doing photoshop or video editing, you don't need much of a graphics card, just memory. Well, maybe not. You'll still need the graphics card for the gaming though.\n\nIf you're a cad designer, you will need to get a good workstation graphics card (nVidia QuadroFX Go 1400 is the best for laptops). Unfortunately, it's not half as good as the desktop QuadroFX 4500 or most of the newer gaming graphics card. If you're really going for the high end, you could get a laptop with an ATI Radeon X800 or X1800 and softmod it, but it's pretty risky. The X1800 might not even be softmod-able. However, even without the softmod, it'll still be pretty fast for OpenGL, not to mention much cheaper than the QuadroFX Go 1400.\n\nFor designing, you'll want a LOT of memory. 2 GIGs is usually fine for anything besides extensive video editing.\n\nYou'll also want a dual-core CPU. AMD Turion X2 is fine, as with the newer centrinos. They aren't the fastest, but they'll keep your laptop cool enough to let the maximum power out of your graphics card and memory.\n\nMid-range solution: The best would be the Dell E1705. Configure it with the 2nd fastest dual-core CPU, 2GIG ram, the GeForce Go 7900 GS. You can check Dealnews.com periodically for Dell deals. They usually post a $750 coupon weekly. The complete system will cost you about $1500-1800. This laptop will run almost as fast as the high-end solutions below. It's by far the best bang for the buck.\n\nHigh-end solutions: An Alienware, Dell XPS M1710, or Sager laptop with an nVidia Go 7900 GTX (http://www.powernotebooks.com/category.php?catId=26#id1415). I would avoid the Alienware and Dell XPS setups because they will be at least $1000 more expensive than the Sager model. However, they're usually better built and have better cooling. If you really want to shell out 50% more money for a 20% gain in quality/speed, go for them. But there's no guarentee that you're going to get anything close to what you're paying for.

First off, most computer power supplies are dual voltage. You should see a switch on the back of the power supply. Set that to 240 volts and you should be fine.\nWhy did you remove the hard drive? Did you have 2 drives before? If so you will need to go into your BIOS and remove the second drive. Outside of that, what does the error that requests you to hit F1 or F2 say exactly? Without knowing why it is asking you to do that no one will know what the problem is.

If no one gives good answer you'll get your five points back. \n\nIt really does matter however if you're asking too many question and spent all your points then you may not be able to do anything anymore!!

I have worked with both Mac's and PC's and i totally vote for the macbook.  The operating system is much more stable and will last longer than another laptop because they are built stronger in my opinion.  PC's are good also if you are in an environment that is PC dominated or if you want to try out software (software for Macs are limited).

A daisy-wheel printer works on the same principle as a ball-head typewriter. The daisy wheel is a disk made of plastic or metal on which characters stand out in relief along the outer edge. To print a character, the printer rotates the disk until the desired letter is facing the paper. Then a hammer strikes the disk, forcing the character to hit an ink ribbon, leaving an impression of the character on the paper. You can change the daisy wheel to print different fonts. \nDaisy-wheel printers cannot print graphics, and in general they are noisy and slow, printing from 10 to about 75 characters per second. As the price of laser and ink-jet printers has declined, and the quality of dot-matrix printers has improved, daisy-wheel printers have become obsolete.

"In computer science:\n\nJava (Sun), a technology developed by Sun Microsystems for machine-independent software, which encompasses: \nJava programming language, an object-oriented high-level programming language \nJava Virtual Machine, the virtual machine that runs Java byte code. This is also referred to as the portion of Java that runs on your PC or the Java run-time environment (JRE) \nJava Platform, the Java virtual machine plus API specifications \nJava Platform, Standard Edition, targets desktop environment \nJava Platform, Enterprise Edition, targets server environment \nJava Platform, Micro Edition, targets embedded consumer products \nJavaScript, a scripting language syntactically similar to, but semantically different from, the Java programming language\n\n-------\n\nLearn About Java Technology \n\nJava technology was created as a computer programming tool in a small, secret effort called ""the Green Project"" at Sun Microsystems in 1991. \n\nThe secret ""Green Team,"" fully staffed at 13 people and led by James Gosling, locked themselves away in an anonymous office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, cut off all regular communications with Sun, and worked around the clock for 18 months. \n\nThey were trying to anticipate and plan for the ""next wave"" in computing. Their initial conclusion was that at least one significant trend would be the convergence of digitally controlled consumer devices and computers. \n\nA device-independent programming language code-named ""Oak"" was the result. \n\nTo demonstrate how this new language could power the future of digital devices, the Green Team developed an interactive, handheld home-entertainment device controller targeted at the digital cable television industry. But the idea was too far ahead of its time, and the digital cable television industry wasn't ready for the leap forward that Java technology offered them. \n\nAs it turns out, the Internet was ready for Java technology, and just in time for its initial public introduction in 1995, the team was able to announce that the Netscape Navigator Internet browser would incorporate Java technology. \n\nNow, nearing its tenth year, the Java platform has attracted over 4 million software developers, worldwide use in every major industry segment, and a presence in a wide range of devices, computers, and networks of any programming technology. \n\nIn fact, its versatility, efficiency, platform portability, and security have made it the ideal technology for network computing, so that today, Java powers more than 2.5 billion devices: \nover 700 million PCs \nover 1 billion mobile phones and other handheld devices (source: Ovum) \n1.25 billion smart cards \nplus set-top boxes, printers, web cams, games, car navigation systems, lottery terminals, medical devices, parking payment stations, etc. \nToday, you can find Java technology in networks and devices that range from the Internet and scientific supercomputers to laptops and cell phones, from Wall Street market simulators to home game players and credit cards -- just about everywhere. \n\nThe best way to preview these applications is to explore java.com, the ultimate marketplace, showcase, and central information resource for businesses, consumers, and software developers who use Java technology. \n\nWhy Software Developers Choose Java Technology \n\nThe Java programming language has been thoroughly refined, extended, tested, and proven by an active community of over four million software developers. \n\nMature, extremely robust, and surprisingly versatile Java technology has become invaluable in allowing developers to: \nWrite software on one platform and run it on practically any other platform \nCreate programs to run within a web browser and web services \nDevelop server-side applications for online forums, stores, polls, HTML forms processing, and more \nCombine Java technology-based applications or services to create highly customized applica"

First, you need to know whether or not your notebook has integrated wireless.  If it does, great.  Go to the linksys website and let it automatically detect your wireless card and give you a list of compatible software.  After that, you can generally do this:\n\nControl Panel -> Network Connections -> Right click on your wireless connection -> Wireless Networks tab -> click to have Windows automatically configure your wireless settings.\n\nThen you should open a browser and connect to your router to configure your wireless settings in your router.  Most use Linksys, so if you do, just type http://192.168.1.1 and go.\nThen if you hadn't set your password in it, it defaults to admin/admin.  Feel free to change your settings to any secure password you feel like, and apply this password to the wireless connection as soon as your wireless network card picks it up.  After that, reboot the router and your notebook, and you should be able to connect.\n\nIf you're still experiencing problems, then you might have conflicting devices.  Use device manager to rule this out.  Also, connecting to another network not your own is not the best answer.  It doesn't provide you with the necessary security while on the internet.  If all else fails, call tech support and allow them to help you. :)

As an old techie, I tend to look at the hardware, or more specifically the connections.\n\nIf your connections are in an area that has gotten dusty over time, clean it out with appropriate dusting measures or canned air.  Unplug your computer, unplug your speakers from the computer, whiz out the connector with canned air, clean both ends with alcohol on a cotton swab, whiz out with canned air again, make sure you have a secure connection (if loose, tape steady in the squarely-in position), and then restart the computer and see if your problem is resolved (suggest you clean all other connections while you're back there).\n\nBest wishes! :)
