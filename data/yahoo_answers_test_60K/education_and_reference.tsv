One difference between a Bachelors and a Masters degree are the requirements. To gain eligibility for a Bachelors, you must have at least a GED and have scored well enough on the SAT. To be eligible for a Masters Degree, you must have completed a Bachelors degree program, and adequate scores on the GRE.\n\nIn addition, as a Bachelors degree student, your first year or two focuses on the acquisition of general knowledge and the last few years become more specialized, focusing primarily on classes for your major/minor area. \n\nIn contrast, the Master's degree program takes usually only 2 years to complete and the student is only focused on learning one speciality area during that time. In addition, a Masters program requires the student to be more of an independent learner, with classes requiring much more research and independent thought.

there's a #1 and a #3, but #2, as the compromise candidate, is by far the most common.\n\n#1 pencils have a harder lead, meaning a lighter color and finer line. Also, they don't wear down as quickly. On the other hand #3 have a softer lead, giving a thicker, darker line and quick wear that requires frequent sharpening. there are even some numbers beyond that but you are only likely to find them in specialty stores, such as art supply.

"How is Brainboost different from existing engines like Google?\n\nBrainboost is an answer engine whereas Google is a Search engine.\n\nWhat that means is that Brainboost actually finds answers to your questions posed in plain English as opposed to directing you to pages that simply mention the questions.\n\nBrainboost, Using the AnswerRank™ system, intelligently reads hundreds of web pages derived from search results and extracts just the short and concise answer to your question, saving you time.\n\nFollowing is a simplistic explanation showing the process of both engines\n\n    Google\n\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\n    * Google Search engine retrieves all pages containing words ""mars"" and red"".\n    * Search results are sorted by the number of links each one of them got from other pages. This is a good way to figure out which one of them is most trusted by others.\n    * Results are displayed with the snippet being the appearance of the question on the pages\n    * Typically, a user would then click on the first search result, read through the document and hope to find an answer.\n    * If an answer is not found within the first search result, the user needs to repeat this process with the next search result, sometimes having to read many web pages to finally get at the answer.\n\n\n    Brainboost\n\n    * User types in : “Why is mars red”\n    * Brainboost translates the query into multiple queries that will raise the probability of finding the ANSWER to the question.\n    * Brainboost retrieves search engine results.\n    * Brainboost retrieves top several hundred pages and reads them.\n    * Brainboost finds answers and ranks them based on it's proprietary AnswerRank™ technology. AnswerRank™ knows to look at a set of many possible answers and rank them as to which one is probably the most correct. In this case: ""Mars is red because of the iron in the soil""\n    * Brainboost displays the ANSWERS to the user\n\nSo you see, Brainboost is a fundamentally different way to find knowledge. Whereas Search engines force you to spend time searching for that piece of information, Brainboost does that for you by automatically reading the search results and extracting the precious answer to your question.\n\nWhen you add up all time we spend plowing through search results for an answer, this functionality translates to hours of time saved.\n\nWhile search engines like MSN and Ask Jeeves have recently made limited attempts at answering questions from finite databases or precanned editorially collected answers, Brainboost is the only engine that leverages the full knowledge available on the web.\n\nBrainboost. It’s the next evolutionary step in search engines."

Sex is important.  How important varies.  Penis size has little to do with a healthy sex life.\n\nIf a woman's vagina is large, it is not becasue she has a lot of sex.  Some women have larger vaginas than others, just as some men have larger penises than others.  Most women acheive orgasm through clitoral stimulation, and the penis has very little to do with that.

It depends.  Colleges will not just look at your grades and GPA.  There are other factors that they include.  If you go to their website, they should have a brief outline of what they are going to look at (i.e. SAT scores, involvement in & out of school, etc..) Most likely, I believe, it's the essay that counts; it can either make or break you.  Plus, you have to consider that there are a lot of people you are competiting with.

"The word oracle in Greek can mean several related things. It means a god who predicts the future, like Apollo. It also means the priest who hears the message, and the message itself, and the place where the priest hears the message. Most often it means the priest or the message. \nThe Greeks believed (like all other ancient people) that you could communicate with the gods at certain places, at certain times, through certain people, and that the gods would give you advice and maybe tell you what was going to happen in the future. \n\nBut the Greek oracles had a couple of advantages too. First, you didn't just come and ask your question. You had to hang around the temple for a while, talking to the priests, so they could get to know you. And they could see you, not just hear your voice on the telephone. Second, everybody came to the same few oracles for help, and the priests at these oracles (unlike the Psychic Hotline) compared notes with each other. So if you asked ""Should I get married?"" and the oracle said ""Yes,"" and then next week your girlfriend comes and she asks, ""Will Gorgias ask me to marry him?"" then the oracle already knows the answer to that one. There is every reason to think that the oracles were worth the money they charged. \n\nhttp://www.cs.utk.edu/~mclennan/BA/LAO.html\nhttp://www.paralumun.com/greekfuture.htm"

If you happen to be in one of the areas they serve, you can contact them for a local listing.\n\nMy little friendly suggestion: a lot of people this time of year decide they want to volunteer NOW. Which is certainly a good and generous thought. But in many cases, organizations may have already filled their holiday needs, from their regular volunteer corps. So try not to feel grumpy or rejected if your idea of a perfect Christmas volunteer outing isn't available.

I have been taking online courses now for almost a year and a half and have found that the program is very rewarding!  I have felt alot less pressure than having traditional classroom instruction.  Although there are several different aspects of online courses, there are many things that have been done through many colleges and universities to bring the online students together.  For example, with the classes that I have taken, there is a discussion board that allows you and other classmates to post interesting topics and help each other with puzzling issues that may arise during the completion of coursework.  In addition, if extra help is needed, there is generally a phone number that you can call for technical support or for assistance.  This can prove to be especially useful when you are enrolled in a math course.  You can e-mail assignments whenever you like, watch lectures on DVD or videotape whenever you like, and do classwork at your convenience.  It actually saves alot of time since you don't have to commute to school and spend alot of time getting ready to go to class.  You can sit at home and do your work in your pajamas! :o)  One thing that I would highly recommend is that you be mindful of the concept of networking and forming outside interests while you are completing your coursework.  Since you are not physically attending classes at a college or university, you still need sufficient time for social activities.  Some colleges give you a start date and an end date to complete coursework.  It is up to you to plan your schedule accordingly.  If you do decide to take an online class, I would recommend that you establish a schedule immediately for your coursework when you get the syllabus and list of assignments.  Make sure that you complete the assignments in a timely fashion.  It also helps to have a buddy that will hold you accountable for completing your reading and written assignments.  I'm sure that this policy will vary from college to college, but when it comes time to take exams, often times with the online class, the professor will not give a time limit and you can take all the time that you want to complete your exam in the presence of a proctor.  This really takes off alot of pressure.  Allow for plenty of time to complete assignments and if you can do it, try to complete your coursework in advance.  If you are an independent learner and don't like to waste time, online classes might be for you.  I hope that some of these suggestions may be helpful to you.  If you want to talk more about online classes, you may shoot me a note.

There are several advantages to the online resources \nthat libraries make available:\n\nThey allow multiple people to utilize one resource at the same time (with print resources, multiple copies must be held by the library to achieve this).\n\nThey allow people to use the library's resources without physically going to the library.  This is especially important for distance education students who may not live anywhere near the school they attend.\n\nThey can be more easily recovered if the physical location is impacted by a disaster.  If the resources are hosted via the internet, all the library has to do is repair or replace its computer equipment, as opposed to hunting down and purchasing replacement copies of destroyed print materials. \n\nOn the downside, online resources are generally more expensive than print, and some things are priced so extravagantly that some libraries can't afford them at all.

"By the definition of Similar triangles - ""Two Triangles are similar if their respective angles are the equal"".\nHence if you have two triangles (A and B) whose respective sides are parallel, then, it means that either triangles A and B are identical or that A is a magnified or diminished version of B. In either case, their angles will be equal hence making them ""Similar""\nTo test this. Draw a triangle (A) on a sheet of paper. Try to draw lines parallel to the sides of triangle A. Ensure that the angles of the new triangle (B) that you are drawing are the exact same as A. You will notice that B is either the exact same as A, A zoomed out or zoomed in version of triangle A"

It is very difficult for foreign students to scholarships to attend college in the US. Scholarships are reserved for students with very high GPA's, huge social work resumes, and citizens. My company has been giving out scholarships for a few years and we just have not seen the level of knowledge, drive, and social work needed to justify a scholarship to a non-us citizen yet. This could change, however, there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of foreign students who wish to study in the US.
If you get into top 35 PhD program you will probably get full scholarship for the first 5 years of your study. You will not be required to work in the first year, but in years 2-5 you will,  have to work as a teaching or research assistant for 20 hours a week. In lower ranked programs financing is usually tighter, so they will base on merit and financial need.

screw  (skr)\n   1. A cylindrical rod incised with one or more helical or advancing spiral threads, as a lead screw or worm screw.\n         2. The tapped collar or socket that receives this rod.\n   2. A metal pin with incised threads and a broad slotted head that can be driven as a fastener by turning with a screwdriver, especially:\n         1. A tapered and pointed wood screw.\n         2. A cylindrical and flat-tipped machine screw.\n\nhttp://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=screw\n\nA screw is a shaft with a helical groove or thread formed on its surface. Its main uses are as a threaded fastener used to hold objects together, and as a simple machine used to translate torque into linear force. It can also be defined as an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft.\n\nA screw used as a threaded fastener consists of a shaft, which may be cylindrical or conical, and a head. The shaft has a helical ridge or thread formed on it. The thread is essentially an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft. The thread mates with a complementary helix in the material. The material may be manufactured with the mating helix (tapped), or the screw may create it when first driven in (a self-tapping screw). The head is specially shaped to allow a screwdriver or wrench to grip the screw when driving it in. It also stops the screw from passing right through the material being fastened and provides compression.

"Good question -- it really depends on WHAT you want to do in radio.  The ""act"" of being a DJ -- playing music and turning-on the microphone etc., -- is really very simple.  The hard part is making what you say entertaining and engaging.  Many colleges have broadcasting departments, and offer students a chance to work in college radio to hone their skills.  If you want to go into radio news, you will need a good education in the way government and society works.  Even a two-year AA degree would be a good start.  Record yourself speaking.  Ask your friends to listen.  Are you saying the ends of words?  Do you say ""pencil"" or ""pensa?""  Do you say ""style"" or ""sty?""  Take speech class at the local college (or high school if you're still there) and ask the teacher to REALLY help you.  You will probably develop a ""radio voice"" different from your everyday voice, and over the years, the two will merge.  Visit a few radio stations, and ask if you can just ""hang-out.""  (Not tour, but actually stay for a few hours.)  Before long, a DJ will say ""hey, can you push that button for me?""  Let's face it -- many DJs have big egos, and would love to show you everything they know!  Let them, and take notes."

I don't think japanese girls are shamed. They are just not used to communicating with foreigners as there are not so many foreigners in Japan after all. Most of them don't speak English or foreign languages so they must kinda be freaked out when foreigners try to approach them I guess. If the foreigners understand Japanese language, they should feel easier. \nI'm sure that more and more Japanese (not only girls) are interested in foreign cultures as well as people.

Diabetes is a disease in which the body is unable to produce or unable to properly use and store glucose (a form of sugar). Glucose backs up in the bloodstream — causing one’s blood glucose (sometimes referred to as blood sugar) to rise too high. \n\nThere are two major types of diabetes. In type 1 (fomerly called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent) diabetes, the body completely stops producing any insulin, a hormone that enables the body to use glucose found in foods for energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take daily insulin injections to survive. This form of diabetes usually develops in children or young adults, but can occur at any age. Type 2 (formerly called adult-onset or non insulin-dependent) diabetes results when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin and/or is unable to use insulin properly (insulin resistance). This form of diabetes usually occurs in people who are over 40, overweight, and have a family history of diabetes, although today it is increasingly occurring in younger people, particularly adolescents.

Ok you need to study in small sessions, and anything most important right before you go to bed. Study for 20-30 minutes, take a 10 minutes break, 20-30 minutes, 10 minute break. Studies show this helps the brain most. Also, study actively. For example, don't just read over something, make a game out of it, or have someone quiz you on it.  Always get 8 hours of sleep, eat healthy foods and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure you start studying at least 1.5-2 weeks before your exams. Make little notecards so you can quiz yourself in those odd moments like on the bus or in line at the store or where ever. If you also re-write key concepts, that helps your brain remember them better. Even if you have a scantron test, know the concept well enough to write an essay so that you are more prepared than you need to be.

"""The turtle is a metaphor for the working class farmers whose stories and struggles are recounted in The Grapes of Wrath. The turtle plods along dutifully, but is consistently confronted with danger and setbacks. Significantly, the dangers posed to the turtle are those of modernity and business. It is the intrusion of cars and the building of highways that endanger the turtle. The truck that strikes it is a symbol of big business and commerce. The Joad family that will soon be introduced will experience similar travails as the turtle, as they plod along wishing only to survive, yet are brutally pushed aside by corporate interests."""

"As the previous answerer mentioned, sublime comes from the Latin word subliminis, which we can see from the related word subliminal. This word was formed by joining ""sub,"" below or in some cases, at the foot of or at, with the word ""limen,"" which means limit, threshold or door. Thus sublime means ""at the limit"" and subliminal means ""below the threshold"" or something like that. You were completely on the right track by noticing that since there is a prefix ""sub,"" you should be able to take it off and get an un-modified word, but in this case, the word changed so much that it became meaningless in English."
"Apart from cover quality, paper quality, print size and layout may differ. Hardcover usually comes in stitched binding which is very durable compared to glued binding.

It mainly has to do with how fast your body gets rid of heat to the surrounding medium. Water can whisk heat away from your body nearly four times faster than air, so it feels cooler to your body. Also, a factor with air is going to be humidity. The more humidity in the air, the less sweat evaporating from you skin and thus the hotter (and stickier) it feels.
"Muawiya was not the founder of Sunni denomination of Islam. (See below)\n\nWith 940 million adherents, Sunni Islam is the largest denomination of Islam. Followers of the Sunni tradition are known as Sunnis or Sunnites; they sometimes refer to themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa'h, ""adherents to the Sunnah and the assembly.""\n\nSunnis have their historical roots in the majority group who followed Abu Bakr, an effective leader, as Muhammad's successor, instead of his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Sunnis are so named because they believe themselves to follow the sunnah or ""custom"" of the Prophet.\n\nAlgeria has nearly 99% Sunni Muslims (Sunni Islam is the state religion), Kuwait has 70% and Afghanistan has a majority of Sunni muslims (around 80%). Sunni Muslims also outnumber Shi'ite Muslims in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan (70%), Syria (80%), Tajikistan (85%), Libya (97%), Jordan (92%) and certain islands like the Maldives, Comoros (98%) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (80%). Iraq has 45-60% of Sunni Muslims, who are concentrated mostly in the central & northern parts of the country. Sunni Muslims are a minority in Iran (10%) and Bahrain (30%).\n\nSunnis base their religion on the Quran and the Sunnah as understood by the majoroty of the community under the structure of the four schools of thought. The four Sunni schools of law (madhahib) - the Hanafi, the Maliki, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali - are sometimes mistakenly understood as different sects, but they are not. These four schools of religious law associate themselves with four great scholars of early Islam: Abu Haneefah, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. These scholars were known for their knowledge and piety throughout the Muslim world. They differed only in minor issues of application of certain principles in the religion and were not in opposition to each other. In fact, Ahmad bin Hanbal was a student of Shafi'i, who was a student of Malik.\n\nSufism is considered by the majority of Sunnis to be integral part of Sunni Islam. It deals with the spiritual aspects of a Sunni Muslim's everyday life. Some of the most famous Sufi schools are the Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Shadhili, Chishti, and Rifa‘i paths or tariqas.\n\nSunnis view the Shi'ites as from the ahlul-bidah; i.e., the people of innovation. Sunnis oppose Shi'ite beliefs concerning some of the companions of the Prophet, the belief in the Imamate and difference on the Caliphate, and others. Other groups considered to be outside Islam by Sunnis are Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.\n\nShia Islam includes most of the Muslims that are not counted among the Sunni. The primary division within Islam, between Sunni and Shi'a, dates to the death of the Prophet Muhammad when his followers were faced with the decision of who would be his successor as the leader of Islam. Shi'ites are those who followed Ali, the closest relative of Muhammad, as Muhammad's successor. Today there are approximately 120 million Shi'ite Muslims in the world.\n\nThe Shia consist of one major school of thought known as the Jafaryia or the ""Twelvers,"" and a few minor schools of thought, as the ""Seveners"" or the ""Fivers."" These names all refer to the number of imams they recognize after the death of Muhammad. The term Shi'a is usually meant to be synonymous with the Jafaryia/Twelvers.\n\nThe Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam\nAli is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the ""rightly guided caliphs"" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh"

A fall from greater than 3 times your height is considered to have enough force behind it to fracture a bone. Since the bone cell (matrix) is a solid matter, it is not likely to convert to a liquid state with an acute increase in force (i.e., a fall). Possibly the immersion of the bone in moisture, or low pressure over a long period of time? In any case, a bone will not turn to a liquid state secondary to the impact from an acute blow or fall. It's just not chemically possible. Hope this helps!

"The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a reading passage is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Although they supposedly use the same measures, just placed into a different scale, the results of the two tests do not always correlate (a text with a better score on the Reading Ease test over another text may end up with a worse score on the Grade Level test.)\n\nFlesch-Kincaid Grade Level\nAn obvious use for readability tests is in the field of education. The ""Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula"" translates the 0-100 score to a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. \n\nThe result is a number that corresponds with a grade level. For example, a score of 6.1 would indicate that the text is understandable by an average student in 6th grade."

In addition to the other answers, King Louis XVI was rather disinterested in the welfare of the French people.  Louis XVI found more interest in throwing parties, hunting, and socializing with the nobility rather than focusing on the problems being faced by the lower class.  Specifically, the lower class experienced much oppression and famine during the period leading up to the French Revolution.\n\nKing Louis also did not hesitate to add to the population of the infamous prision, The Bastille. The prison's name is now lent to the French holidy, Bastille Day.\n \nMarie Antoinette, King Louis XVI's wife, was executed along with the king and much of the French nobility by the lower class which brought on the French Revolution.

The bullet has much higher kinetic energy than the gun.\nThe bullet and the gun will have the same MOMENTUM but the bullet has more energy. (And a good thing for the shooter!) Kinetic energy is calculated using the mass of the object and the SQUARE of the velocity, while momentum is calculated using the mass of the object and the velocity. \n   If the bullet and the gun were equal in weight they'd have the same energy AND the same momentum - and the shooter would have an injured hand.
If you want to study it in college, begin looking at those that offer the program.  Then contact someone in the department to find out more specific information about the program such as requirements for graduating, what projects they are working on, how involved they are in the community, and who the professors are.  Make sure you that you keep in mind what YOUR interests are.  For example, don't choose a university that focuses on southwestern archaeology if you would rather study underwater archaeology.\n\nOnce you find a program you like and are accepted, get involoved in the depratment.  Get to know the professors and staff members. This will give you more opportunities for field experience or internships.  You will go alot further in the field if you know people than if you only attend class.  In archaeology, its who you know that really takes you places. It doesn't take long for us to realize who is really going to make it in the field.\n\nIf you are purely just interested in it, there are many books out there on the subject, some excellent and some fiction.  Make sure you choose something that was written by a archaeologist working at the academic level or a respected agency.  If you don't you may end up with something about divination.  Also, Archaeology Magazine is an excellent source about what going on in the field right now.  You may also be interested in joining the AIA (Archaeology Institute of America).  It has chapters all over the country which usually hold field trips and monthly lectures.\n\nWhat you do not want to do is play Indiana Jones and just start digging things up on your own.  Through education you will be taught the proper techniques and guidelines for excavation so the data you collect will be useful.  As soon as you dig something up, you will lose its context and any information it can give about the past.  Proper education will teach you how to save this information.\n\nSo, when it comes to Archaeology stay up to date, stay involved, and always be willing to learn something new!  \n\nIts an amazing field to be involved in and very rewarding!
Fastweb is a good resouce. Also you have to fill out the FAFSA (free application for federal student aid) this is what the government (state and federal) and the schools themselves use to determine scholarship eligibility. Also, go to your college financial aid office, they have a lot of resources about scholarships for a given field of study or for a given religion or a given community. You have to go there to find out. Also, my high school had a scholarship for people who's parents went to the high school too (multi-generational attendance). You might want to check with your employer or your parents employers too. \n\nGood luck.

"Cool, you have asked what is totally QUESTION NUMBER ONE in basic physics. It's an exciting question which many teachers secretly don't understand and so their students get this hazy idea and kind of go thru the motions. Here's a way to remember and understand through a kooky made-up story.\n\nWow, it is so basic, that it took a super-genius, I mean way smarter than Einstein, to figure it out. A good old farm boy, astrologer, magician & alchemist, religious fanatic, mathematician and all around kook. Yep. Sir Isaac Newton. You gotta wonder what kind of parents would name their kid ""Sir""\n\nWell we all know what a force is, it is a sort of push or pull -- think of it as something that changes or *tries to change* the motion of stuff.\n\nNewton first figured out that if you leave a thing alone, or if the pushes and pulls on it cancel out, then it will sit there like a lump. Like those drivers wearing hats, and like sit there after the light has already turned green two minutes ago.\n\nOr else a thing will keep moving in the same straight line direction and speed like those drivers wearing hats who go 40 mph on the expressway with their turn signal blinking on and on. This is known as ""THE HAT LAW"".\n\nAll was well until he noticed that things move faster in an amount equal to how much you bully them or push them around. Twice the force, twice the fasterness and fasterness (also known as acceleration). This is called the ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"".\n\nThen he discovered a fly in the ointment. His HAT and BULLY laws didn't really explain all that much. Something was gumming up this beautiful theory. We call it MASS and it is still an unknown mystery as to what it really is. So we vaguely call it the amount of stuff or matter in a thing.\n\nSo he found out that for a certain force the faster-isity (acceleration) is cut in half if you double the mass. The bully has to push twice as hard to fasterize two little kids. So he was like ""I'll just add that in, and all will be cool"". The ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"" and ""THE HAT LAW"" totally did it all. Wa ta da babee!\n\nBut then Newton had a road accident. He was gunning his Harley over London bridge at like 250 when a bug hit him in the mouth and knocked out one of his wooden teeth. He was all ""Why am I so in pain?"". And the bug as it squooshed said ""Help! I'm a bug!""\n\nSo spitting out the splinters of his wooden tooth and the splattered bug, he had this revelation. He realized that because he was moving so fast, and the bug slowed down so fast, that even a eentsy mass like a bug was like taking a hammer to his tooth.\n\nHe noticed that the force was equal to the mass of the bug times the speed of impact all happening in a brief moment. Since Newton spoke Latin (he was the love child of Joe Newton and an Italian governess) he wrote ""Fastus buggus ina momentum hurtus like crazy."" Today we call this ""momentum"". It is just ""mass times speed"" or ""force times a small moment of time"".\n\nAnd he realized that the bug smashed up his tooth, but also that the bug was squashed (like a bug) because they were trading the EXACT same amount of momentum. The force on the tooth by the bug in the moment of time was PRECISELY equal to the smacko-ing the tooth used to stop the bug dead.\n\nHe said ""Hey, like he broke my tooth, but I killed him soooo dead!"" He did the math and found that the force of the bug on the tooth was equal to the force of the tooth on the bug!\n\nNo way did the two equal forces cancel, after all, his tooth was hammered to splinters, and the bug was flattened. They were equal and opposite, but since one was on the tooth, and the other force was on the bug they did serious damage! Today we call this the ""HELP I'M A BUG"" law.\n\nNow our man 'Zack was all set. He wrote down his three laws:\n\nTHE HAT LAW (beeep! beeep! Move it Hat G"

Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes. Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia. Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nThere are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:\n\nSubclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic) \nSubclass Lepospondyli \nOf the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:\n\nOrder Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species \nOrder Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 552 species \nOrder Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 171 species \nAuthorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

"Fascinating facts about the invention of the Hula Hoop by \nRichard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin in 1958. HULA-HOOP® \n \n  \nYou may think that the Hula Hoop was a fad born in the 1950s, but in fact people were doing much the same thing with circular hoops made from grape vines and stiff grasses all over the ancient world. More than three thousand years ago, children in Egypt played with large hoops of dried grapevines.  The toy was propelled along the ground with a stick or swung around at the waist.\nDuring the fourteenth century, a ""hooping"" craze swept England, and was as popular among adults as kids.   The records of doctors at the time attribute numerous dislocated backs and heart attacks to ""hooping.""  The word hula became associated with the toy in the early 1800s when British sailors visited the Hawaiian Islands and noted the similarity between ""hooping"" and hula dancing.  In 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores. \n\nThe item attracted the attention of Wham-0, a fledgling California toy manufacturer. Richard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin, of Wham-O, manufactured a plastic hoop in a variety of bright colors.  Knerr and Melin promoted it for months in 1958 on Southern California playgrounds where they would do demonstrations and give away hoops to get the children to learn and play. Their perseverence turned HULA HOOP into the greatest fad the country has ever seen. Twenty-five million were sold in four months! \nThe Hula Hoop was introduced in 1958 and made the two men very rich indeed.   \n\nThe fad died out in the sixties, but Hula Hoops are now very much with us again thanks to the fitness craze.  What better way to grind off those unsightly bulges around the waist and hips.\n \nAT A GLANCE:\nIn 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores.

Besides money, everyday math helps you plan for parties, select the right car parts and correctly double Aunt Jo's cookie recipe.  Some professionals use math to design iPods, Sirius radio, and the hybrid Honda Civic.  Other professionals use math to save the rain forest, create bionic eyes, and find new sources of energy.  Higher order math provide theories or guesses into the unknown such as the origin of the Universe or the existence of n-th Dimensions.  For me, math is mostly about money.

"That depends on how you define the word ""computer.""\n\nA succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features of modern computers, such as the use of digital electronics (invented by Claude Shannon in 1937) and more flexible programmability. Defining one point along this road as ""the first computer"" is exceedingly difficult. Notable achievements include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, a special-purpose machine that used valve-driven (vacuum tube) computation, binary numbers, and regenerative memory; the secret British Colossus computer (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of valves could be made reliable and reprogrammed electronically; the American ENIAC (1946) — which was one of the first general purpose machine, but still used the decimal system and incorporated an inflexible architecture that meant reprogramming it essentially required it to be rewired and Konrad Zuse's Z machines, with the electromechanical Z3 (1941) being the first working machine featuring automatic binary arithmetic and feasible programability."

"The history of the abbreviation OK is not what you'd expect. Some think that it comes from the Chocktaw affirmative okeh, or the Greek olla kalla, or others. The truth is that in the 1830's in New England, initialisms were the fad. Much like TGIF and FYI in modern times, in fact. The craze even went into generating letter combinations of intentional misspellings. Popular ones were ""K.G."" for ""know go"", ""K.Y."" for ""know use"", and ""O.W."" for ""oll write"". ""O.K."" naturally followed, standing for ""oll korrect"". O.K. is the only one that survived through the years. It's because of Martin Van Buren, elected our eighth president in 1836. He was born in Kinderhook, New York. Early in his political career, he was nicknamed ""Old Kinderhook"", which echoed the Oll Korrect initialism. OK became the rallying cry of the Old Kinderhook Club, a political organization supporting Van Buren during the 1840 campaign. The initials stuck as what H. L. Mencken described as ""the most shining and sucessful Americanism ever invented""."

"In 1916, Albert Einstein laid the foundation for the invention of the laser and its predecessor, the maser, in a ground-breaking rederivation of Max Planck's law of radiation based on the concepts of spontaneous and induced emission. The theory was forgotten until after World War II.\n\nIn 1953, Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser, a device operating on similar principles to the laser, but producing microwave rather than optical radiation. Townes' maser was incapable of continuous output. Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the Soviet Union worked independently on the quantum oscillator and solved the problem of continuous output systems by using more than two energy levels. These systems could release stimulated emission without falling to the ground state, thus maintaining a population inversion. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 ""for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.""\n\nIn 1957 Charles Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow, then at Bell Labs, began a serious study of the infrared maser. As ideas were developed, infrared frequencies were abandoned with focus on visible light instead. The concept was originally known as an ""optical maser"". Bell Labs filed a patent application for their proposed optical maser a year later. Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript of their theoretical calculations to Physical Review, which published their paper that year (Volume 112, Issue 6).\n\nSimultanously, Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral thesis on the energy levels of excited thallium. Gould and Townes met and had conversations on the general subject of radiation emission. After that meeting, Gould made notes about his ideas for a ""laser"" in November 1957. In 1958, Prokhorov proposed an open resonator which became an important ingredient of future lasers. The first introduction of the term ""laser"" to the public was in Gould's 1959 paper ""The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"".\n\nFollow the link for more information.

The transmission line should consist of the core conductor and the shield.  The shield should be tied to earth (ground) at the source end, which will shunt unwanted (spurious) signals to ground.  This prevents them from being induced onto the transmission line and causing weak/distorted signals at the termination.  I hope that helps.\n\nP.S. -  Never tie both ends of the shield to earth...it causes an earth loop which shows up as a ghost image of the original transmission that is out of phase (sync) with the original.

Obviously, go to college to be certified to teach history. You will also have to take classes in educational methods, i.e. how to teach. It would be good for you to volunteer with the age group you are interested in teaching while you are in college so you can determine if you really enjoy other people's children enough to spend hours with them every day. What I find most challenging about teaching is keeping myself from getting burnt out from everyone needing something from me all the time. You will need to remember that some students will love history, some will hate it, and most will tolerate it because it is required. You also should consider being certified in a second teaching area, because jobs teaching history are hard to come by. Often districts want teachers who can teach more than one class.

"Have you tried mnemonics? it is a technique to improve memory, and it works great when you have to remember a lot of information. Just to give you an example, say you are studying the various parts of a cell and their functions:\n\nMITOCHONDRIA: site of aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cells it is a membrane bound organelle found in greater numbers in cells with high energy demands such as muscle. Made up of internal folds called cristae it is a double membraned organelle.\n\nLYSOSOME:  organelle which contains powerful digestive enzymes which are sometimes used in ""cell suicide"".  When energy flow to the membrane from the mitochondria is interrupted, the lysosome membrane ruptures releasing its contents resulting in the destruction of the cell. Found in protozoans, sperm and egg, thyroid cells, and leukocytes.\n\nNow, how will you remember their functions? Mnemonics means you associate words together to help you remember, or make up a silly/funny sentence that helps you or make up short forms. \n\nMy examples: \nmitochondria - mighty (sounds similar) - energy\nso these are related to producing energy\n\nlysosome - last days! (based on the sounds again, L and S) - suicide!\nso this is related to the destruction of the cell\n\nHere's more detail:\nMnemonic techniques are more specific memory aids. Many are based on the general memory strategies that were presented earlier. Although it can be easiest to remember those things that you understand well, sometimes you must rely on rote memory. The following techniques can be used to facilitate such memorization.\nACRONYMS. You form acronyms by using each first letter from a group of words to form a new word. This is particularly useful when remembering words in a specified order. Acronyms are very common in ordinary language and in many fields. Some examples of common acronyms include NBA (National Basketball Associations), SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), BTUs (British Thermal Units), and LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). What other common acronyms can you think of? The memory techniques in this section, for example, can be rearranged to form the acronym ""SCRAM"" (Sentences/acrostics, Chunking, Rhymes & songs, Acronyms, and Method of loci).\n\nLet us suppose that you have to memorize the names of four kinds of fossils for your geology class: 1) actual remains, 2) Petrified, 3) Imprint, and 4) Molds or casts. Take the first letter of each item you are trying to remember: APIM. Then, arrange the letters so that the acronym resembles a word you are familiar with: PAIM or IMAP.\n\nSENTENCES/ACROSTICS. Like acronyms, you use the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. Instead of making a new word, though, you use the letters to make a sentence.

A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted. Yet the work was vital - fa

"I was hesitant about walking also, mainly because I really didn't know any of my peers in my graduating class either.  However, I did because there was that whole parental guilt trip thing ""We've waited so long to see you graduate!""

Lots. They didn't have trucks or higways back then. If farmers wanted to ship their crops to market, it had to go by riverboat or train. Towns that had railroads prospered; town's that didn't dried up and blew away.\n\nThe cattle drives that you read about were cowboys taking their cattle to rail yards in Kansas, where the cattle were shipped east to be made into steaks and shoes. Texas didn't have any railroads at first.\n\nLots of towns didn't have reliable water transportation, so they needed railroads. Just HAVING 160 (320, 640) acres of corn, wheat or barley didn't make a farmer rich; he had to ship it to market to sell it. \n\nA train could carry hundreds of times more than a horse-drawn wagon, and do it cheaper. That cut down on the transportation cost, which in turn made it economically possible to grow wheat in Nebraska and Kansas, but sell it to New York.

"The scores on each of the GRE subtests range from 200-800. These scores are called ""standard"" scores and are comparable between the subtests. They have an average of 500 with a standard deviation of 100 (which means that, all things considered, two scores that are less than 100 points apart are not significantly different from one another).\n\nThere are some differences in the ""average"" of each group that takes the test. So there are also percentile rank scores given, which can give you some idea of how you did compared to others who took the test. Percentile ranks range from about 1 to 99. A percentile rank of 83 means that you scored as well or higher than 83 out of 100 students who took the test when you did.\n\nGraduate schools tend to look at the verbal and the quantitative sections, and many don't really know what the analytical section means. Higher scores are generally considered to signal greater likelihood of success in graduate school. Different programs and different degree levels have different expectations for minimum GRE scores. Doctoral programs generally require higher minimum scores than masters programs, competitive schools want higher scores than less competitive schools.\n\nHope this helps."

Well, your term psychological counseling is confusing because I can't tell what exactly you want to do. Assuming that you want to be a Counseling Psychologist, here is a list of doctoral programs in counseling psychology:\nhttp://gradschool.about.com/cs/programdatabase/l/blcounspsyalpha.htm\n\nThe top schools according to research productivity are at:\nhttp://www.socialpsychology.org/gcounsel.htm\n\nThis list is important for those folks who want to go to a program with an emphasis on developing university faculty and researchers.\n\nHere is another list:\nThe 11 top schools, in order, are: University of Missouri, University of Maryland, University of Akron, State University of New York (Albany), Iowa State University, Arizona State University, University of Minnesota (Twin Cities), University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University and Ball State University.\n\nHope this helps.

"In the first question, St. Thomas addresses sacred scripture and whether it is science, wisdom, what is its subject, whether it is a matter of argument, etc.  You can read it yourself to figure out his answers:\n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/100100.htm\n\nIn Q. 12, St. Thomas addresses how God, an infinite being, may be known by us, finite creatures.  This is a difficult matter, and must be addressed article by article. \n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/101200.htm\n\nFinally, in the 13th question, St. Thomas deals with the names of God, that it, whether anything can properly be said of God.  \n\nhttp://www.newadvent.org/summa/101300.htm\n\nRegarding salvation, St. Thomas argues that man cannot attain happiness (a vision of God ala Q. 12) by his own action.  However, ""rectitude of will"" is necessary on the part of man for happiness.  http://www.newadvent.org/summa/200507.htm\n\nI'm not sure, however, of the 3 ways St. Thomas said that man can obtain salvation."

Unless you plan to go to Canada or France often, choose Spanish. French is a beautiful language but there is no way to use it, so you'll lose it quickly. Spanish is way more useful and easier to learn. (and many jobs will pay you more if you know it) Sorry this doesn't really answer your question. Maybe you could buy those French on tapes CDs/DVDs.

"Gotham was first used in reference to New York City by Washington Irving in the satirical piece Salmagundi (1807). Gotham was at that point already known to refer to a place with ""foolish inhabitants."" Somehow the name stuck to NYC, even though it had originally been a nickname for Nottinghamshire (a village in England where, apparently, wise men acted as fools in order to avoid paying for the king's upkeep)."
everyone hates homework... except those truely sickminded academics in this world {wink}.\n\nHowever, I can tell you that homework is actually the most important part of school work and self-learning skills to do.\n\nIn almost any career and field ongoing study is necessary to keep competitive in your field of work.  Those who do not, get lost at the sides and get the lower paying jobs.\n\nYou need to make the choice about what you want to do in life, and that includes being being proactive in learning and studying your lessons.
In my opinion, it would be American.\nAt one time, it was British. But the trend now seems to be very much leaning towards American.\nCanadian and American is almost identical, with the exception of a couple of vowel inflections.\nAustralian isn't used (except by Australians) because it can be difficult to understand.
I'm an Undergrad Lit. student and, to be honest, every single one of my professors uses either Nota Bene or NB.  Some use both, which is rather redundant, but alas, they have doctorates, and I don't. Over the last 3 years, I'm simply accepted it.  So yes, people still do use the term.  Granted, this is scholarly writing, but it's still writing.  And English is based on Latin, to some degree, so by using Latin in English writing, you're speaking English.

Call your campus housing office and see if they keep a list of persons who want roommates and you can list your name/number there to advertise without posting all over campus. If your housing office doesn't do this, see if you have an office of commuter students or adult students that is for students who live off campus and chances are they will have some type of roommate list.\n\nAlso, you can list an email address to respond to, although I'm not sure as many people will respond to an email as to a phone number. Get a non-crazy sounding Yahoo email account name just for this process and then cancel the account when you have a roommate. \n\nHope this helps.

"The answer to that is ""no."" The old ""glass is a slow moving liquid"" bit is an old wives tale. Or in this case, an old professors tale.\n\nThe essential reason is that in a fluid all the molecules are disordered and only loosely bound. While in glass the molecues are strongly bound, although disordered. \n\nThere is some wiggle room in the definition of solid and liquid, but it probably doesn't matter in this instance. The main evidence for glass being a liquid is the claim that glass in, say, old buildings has slowly settled and made the bottom thinker has never been shown to be due to glass being a liquid. In fact, the existence of perfectly fine glass from the time of the Roman Empire makes it unlikely.\n\nThe second link I've included is an extensive discussion of the whole ""windows are flowing down"" bit - the conclusion being, that it is more likely the panes were made with uneven thickness and the glass was inserted with the thicker end down - which  is the logical thing to do in that circumstance."

Alot of it has to do with the shorthand used for text messages and IMing. Because of the rapidness of the conversation a generally accepted form of shorthand developed to increase the rate of conversation. If you could look at the people who demonstrate these forms of bad grammar on message boards like this one, I would be willing to bet they are high school/early college aged who grew up conversing on the computer. To them the commonly accepted rules of syntax are loosened for convience. Therefore they are following a commonly agreed upon set of rules, which in a way make this a unique language while derived from english, follow different rules. Check out the source for examples.

Introducing the alphabet as a game with letter books or flash cards, scholastic's Hands on Learning textured cards are great. Make number and letter activities part of everyday fun and activities. Try not to push the 'learning' experience as under 2 is a bit young to expect to sit still and rigidly pay attention. I find that stopping a game while it is still fun will lead to wanting to play more in the future. The first site I listed has many activities with the 'why's' behind them and the second site is an english as foreign language site (I teach english in korea) there are many very simple introductory coloring pages and simple activites like reciepes and games.

There is a longstanding myth that the Great Wall of China is the only manmade object visible from space. It and several variations on the theme are great fodder for water cooler arguments. In reality, many human constructs can be seen from Earth orbit.\n\nShuttle astronauts can see highways, airports, dams and even large vehicles from an Earth orbit that is about 135 miles (217 kilometers) high.

Overall, I think Cooley is a good law school.  The obvious draw back is that it doesn't have much national recognition or prestige, which translates to difficulty in obtaining certain types of legal employment (by which I mean the kinds of jobs that pay good salaries).  This is pretty easy to see if you compare the average starting salary of a Cooley grad to those of schools in other tiers.  \n\nThat said, I think the quality of education you can get at Cooley is on par with any law school in the country.  While they don't have the big name professors at the fore front of their fields, I found all of the professors I had to be very capable educators, and truly concerned with helping us to understand the law.\n\nIt is difficult to say how tough it is to succeed at Cooley.  I worked very hard, got a 4.0 my first semester, a 3.9 my second semester (15 hours each semester) and transferred to an Ivy League law school.  In my mind, anything less wouldn't have been successful, but other people were thrilled to have above a B average.\n\nOne thing that is certainly true at Cooley is that there isn't any grade inflation.  While an average GPA at top schools might be 3.4, I calculated the average GPA in my section at Cooley to be around 2.2 - more than a full point lower.  But that is a little misleading, too.  While the curve is lower, due to the admission requirements, there are also a lot more people at Cooley that in all honesty aren't competing for the top grades.\n\nIn sum, I would say that purely from an educational standpoint, Cooley is a great school.  When it comes to getting a job, especially in medium to large law firms, Cooley is subpar.  If that is your (husband's) goal, it is very important to work harder than he thinks he needs to, and get the very best grades, and transfer to the highest ranked school possible.  It's sad that it has to be that way, but it is.\n\nGood Luck!
Your test may not be enough, and the alumni has to be one of the donating types that helps support the school.  BOth of those things will help, but I would also suggest spending a year at a different very reputable college and get a perfect GPA.  One with Harvard Grads teaching your courses preferably.

Like others in my prefession I've been going back to collage in order to get a more diverse education. \n\nYes, but I would suggest you find something you enjoy doing every day. most people go to college so they can get a high paying job only to find themselves misserable with what they are doing. Then they let them selves be trapped by their lifestyle and are now deperessed because they feel stuck at what they are doing so they can maintain the lifestyle. \nFind your nich. while in College find out what you really enjoy. what classes are fun and exciting. what gives you enough excitement ot get out of bed each day. Then make some goals. then have fun making your goals come true. \n\nRead thebook: The Magic of Thinking Big by Pealy (i think) good book.

a GPA depends on the scale.  Some GPA scales are on 100, some are on a 4 scale and some are on a 5 scale.  A GPA scale can be on any scale, which is why it is followed by the maximum (such as your 94.6 out of 100).  There is no national or global standardization, so a 95 at one school may not be better than a 85 at another.  It is very subjective.\n\nWith that said, you can take your 94.6, divide by 100, and then multiple by whatever scale you want.  Your 94.6 on a 4.0 scale would be a 3.784.

"Comes from the latin, ""medium aevum"" which translated to ""Middle Ages"". \n\nThe ""Middle Ages"" formed the middle period in a traditional schematic division of European history into three ""ages"": the classical civilization of Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and modern times. The Middle Ages of Western Europe are commonly dated from the end of the Western Roman Empire (5th century) until the rise of national monarchies, the start of European overseas exploration, the humanist revival, and the Protestant Reformation starting in 1517. These various changes all mark the beginning of the Early Modern period that preceded the Industrial Revolution."

This is what helped me through college:\n-sit in the front of the class (for less distractions)\n-take good notes\n-go over the notes at home, make sure you understand your notes, and attend office hours if you have questions. Sometimes I even recopied my notes\n-for math, I liked to work on the sample problems in the book before attempting the homework.\n-study groups help a lot. when you teach someone something you actually learn it better...and hopefully, someone else can help you out.\n-find time to relax and unwind. don't study 100% of the time.\n-avoid all nighters, plan ahead and manage your time wisely\n-just remember you are paying for college and it's not free. each class you miss is equivalent of several hundred dollars. Teachers don't care if you attend or not (this isn't highschool anymore)\n\nBottom line is, the 4-5 years you work hard in college will pay huge dividends when you are out in the work force. I have seen companies that only interview students with a 3.0 or greater GPA. I have also seen many people waste their lives away partying,smoking, etc...and getting kicked out. It's sad to see.\n\nBest of luck to you!

Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia, reference work that provides information on a range of subjects. Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest, or they can focus on a particular field of study, such as a geographic area, an ethnic group, a time period, or an academic discipline. Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles, each addressing a distinct topic. Many of the articles contain illustrations, maps, photographs, and other media elements that help readers understand concepts. For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books, but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats, such as CD-ROM, digital video disc (DVD), and on the Internet. \n\nThe term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia, meaning “comprehensive education” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge, or a comprehensive education in a specific subject. This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work, in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically. Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago, although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century.
"The first real wave of Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1848 in response to the discovery of gold. They were merchants who sold their stock to the settlers and miners and then went in search for gold themselves. They wrote home to share their experiences and by 1851 there were almost 25,000 Chinese, called ""Celestials"" for the Celestial Empire of China, on the West Coast. These immigrants were almost all from the province of Kwangtung in southern China, traveling through the harbors of Canton and Hong Kong. In rural China of the time, the purpose of life was the well-being of the family group. Many families sold possessions and/or borrowed in order to send one young man to America to make a fortune, not for himself, but to send back home to his family. The idea was to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible and then to return home. Other miners resented their lack of interest in becoming naturalized and by 1852 they were being driven from the mines. Still seeking their fortunes, many turned to jobs which the miners did not want to perform for themselves, such as cooking and laundry. By 1860 many had returned home. Then in 1862 the Union Pacific and Central Pacific cross-continental rail line began construction. A new wave of immigrants came from China through the Chinese Six Companies, organized into crews with their passage prepaid and then deducted from their monthly wages. When the railroad was completed in 1869, some Chinese returned home but for each one who returned, two more arrived. Some 123,000 came in the 1870's. The economy and political situation was against them. The Gold Rush was over and most people had failed to make their fortune. The railroad was completed, the major swamplands had been filled, and industry did not need the thousands of unskilled laborers. An agitator named Dennis Kearney organized what became the Workingman's Party in an effort to drive the immigrants away and protect American jobs. Harrassment escalated until the Exclusion Act of 1882 which was intended to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. Many Chinese left. Those who remained responded by moving away from the West Coast and establishing neighborhoods of their own whereever they went. Family life was the exception in these communities since most immigrants were single young men, or if married, had left their wives at home, expecting only a short stay in America. The Exclusion Laws made it almost impossible to bring family into the country. The Chinese distrusted American institutions and formed their own family associations, district organizations, and halls. Tongs were first founded as social clubs, but some, especially in San Francisco between 1880 and 1900 became involved in crime and vice. The Exclusion Laws were not repealed until the United States and China allied during World War I. Many of the original immigrants had either returned home or died, but enough remained to cause another wave of immigration as families were finally allowed to reunite. Then in 1949 the Communist takeover of mainland China caused a new wave of immigration. Unlike previous waves, many were from the educated and upper levels of society, and they brought entire families at once. This trend of educated, skilled immigrants and immigrants of all ages has continued into today."

The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India.

Well, if you are in the United States, if it is determined she need special ed, they are legally obligated to provide it.  In other countries the rules might be different, but I believe that in most developed countries the public schools are required to provide a program to meet your child's needs...\n\nBut she may not need special ed.  First off, if she doesn't talk at all at school she may be selectively mute.  When kids are selectively mute, it's not necessarily that anyone did anything wrong (it can be caused by trauma, but it doesn't have to be), but psycotherapy can help.  Next, for your discription of her behavior, it sounds like she probably has some form of a learning disability.  I don't doubt that she's smart, but for whatever reason she doesn't process things in a 'normal' way.  Get her tested!  Be sure to find someone good to test her, even if it costs you more and/or you have to go farther from home, believe me it's worth it.  A psycological assessment will tell you what's going on, and provide some recommendations about what to do about it (this is why you want a good tester - if the person testing her doesn't know much the report won't tell you much).  In US public school, the results may also provide legal grounds to force the school to provide a suitable program (and I expect this is the case in public schools elsewhere, although I don't know for sure).

"The most obvious is the line:\n\n""Wherefore art thou Romeo?""\n\nWherefore does not mean ""where"" as if she's asking where he is.  She's asking why he had to be Romeo, in other words, from a family that her family is feuding.  She's asking why he couldn't have been someone else.\n\nA modern-day lament might be, ""Oh, why did I have to fall in love with HIM?  Why couldn't it have been someone else -- anyone else!?"""

Below are some sample resumes for your reference:\n\nhttp://www.resume-resource.com/samples.html\n\nHere are some tips:\n1. If you have less than 10 years of experience, you want your resume to be one page.\n2. Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section. You can also find more examples and templates online if you do a search.\n\nGood luck and have a nice day.
A good paragraph should have a topic sentence, supporting details, and a conclusion. The topic sentence tells what you are going to talk about. Supporting details give the reader more information.  The conclusion restates what was said in the topic sentence.  A good paragraph should also have correct spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. Your sentences in the paragraph should include good descriptive words and not begin with and, but, or because.

Eclipses of the sun and moon usually happen six months apart and then in a fortnightly patten when they do. As an example, there will be a penumbral lunar eclipse on March 14th 2006 and about a fortnight later there will be a solar eclipse on March 29th, similarily on September 7th 2006 there is a partial eclipse of the moon followed by a solar eclipse on September 22nd 2006.

I think you are speaking in context of Shakespears work,  Ceasar was there to discuss The banishment of Mettulus's brother, he was rather rude in all of this and full of himself throughout the play, cocky. Caesar was a member of a Oligarcy of small group of equal rulers.  After he proceed to wage war and defeat them he was sole leader or the roman empireor dictator for life.... where the term czar or Kaiser came from......  This is what prompted the senators to go ahead with execution plans in 44BC.   \n\nNow the Ides of march as you have seen above for simplicity sake is generally accepted at the 15th of march.  The term comes from Roman mythos which gaves names to the 1st(Kalends  -spelling anyone?, 7th (nones)and middle (Ides)days of the month.  The calender was supposedly created by the founders of rome romulus and remus.  the rest of the days were described by counting days from or to one of the above days.... example Ides of march and five days would be the 19th of march.... think roman numerials.   Now some months the Ides fell on the thirteenth of the month.  Now this term was used all the way until shakeperes time fluently probably due to the classical nature of roman literature.  Now it is familar due to shakesperes work.
"The lysosomes have sometimes been likened to ""The Police Force of the Cell"". Even in a place as small as a cell, we need someone to keep things in order. But unlike the police, these lysosomes literally eat things which disturb the natural order of the cell. Lysosomes pick up foreign invaders such as bacteria, food and old organelles and break them into small pieces that can hopefully be used again. If they pick up a really harmful invader, they will eat it up and expel what is left of it out of the cell so that the debris can be removed from the body. \n\nThe lysosome is able to do this because it is filled with enzymes. These enzymes are specially made for the lysosome by the rough endoplasmic reticulum and work only at low pH (highly acidic) levels. The reason for this is that the enzymes are so strong that they could eat the whole cell if the lysosome ever let them out. However because they can only work at low pH levels and the rest of the cell has a neutral pH level, they can be neutralized if they accidentally escape from the lysosome. \n\nElectron micrograph of lysosomes. \n\nLysosomes are produced in the Golgi apparatus \n\nFrom here they are dispersed throughout the cytosol. Despite the fact that the range of enzymes found in lysosomes are fairly uniform throughout many types of cells they take many forms. For example some are comparatively large (up to 1 um in diameter) whereas other present as small vesicles (25 to 50 nm in diameter). This variation is most evident in macrophages which are cells specialised in ingesting particles and organisms which have invaded the body. Along with similar organelles called peroxisomes they form what is known as the acid vesicle system . \n\nWithin the human acid vesicle system there are more than 30 defined acid hydrolases present in various types of lysosome. \n\nAnother function of lysosome in the human occurs during fertilization of the egg by the sperm. The head of the sperm cell contains a package of lysosomal material called the acrosome. The enzymes from this are released when the sperm makes contact with an egg and they effectively bore a hole through the cell membrane of the egg allowing the sperm to enter. \n\nLysosomes also play a key role in destroying old organelles within the cell and thus allow them to be replaced with fresher, more effective ones. \nThis process is known as autophagy and is accomplished in two stages. Firstly a membrane is donated by the endoplasmic reticulum. This membrane then surrounds the old organelle. Secondly a lysosome fuses with this membrane to form an autophagic vacuole. The lysosome can safely enter it's deadly enzyme contents into this vacuole and destroy the old organelle. \nIn human liver cells it is calculated that at least one mitochondria undergoes autophagy every 10 minutes. This reflects the highly active nature of the liver as an organ and it's need for a constant supply of fresh organelles. \nThe electron micrograph below shows a lysosome in the process of destroying a membrane bound mitochondria."

"Aruba's currency is the guilder / florin denoted by the letters 'Awg.' but also widely known as 'Afl.' The official rate at which banks accept U.S. dollar banknotes is Awg. 1,77 and checks at Awg. 1,78. The rate of exchange granted by shops and hotels ranges from Awg. 1,75 to Awg. 1,80 per U.S. dollar. U.S. Dollars are widely accepted in Aruba, and banks may exchange other foreign currency.\n\nTraveler's checks are widely accepted and there is no charge for using them in hotels, restaurants and stores. Major credit cards are accepted at most establishments while personal checks are normally not accepted. \n\nThe Aruban florin is divided into 100 cents and there are coins of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, 1 florin (100 cents) as well as the 5 florin coin. The square shaped 50 cent ""yotin"" coin is probably Aruba's best-known coin. \n\nBanknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 florins. Many souvenirs are made with the square 50 cent coin while the coin itself makes a unique gift for numismatic friends.\n\nCash may be obtained with MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards at credit card offices, banks, in some casinos and via Western Union. ATM cards and credit cards are accepted by ATMs of Aruba Bank, Banco di Caribe, RBTT Bank, and Caribbean Mercantile Bank. The card must have either a Cirrus or Visa Plus logo. ATM instructions are normally given in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento. Cash is normally dispensed in local currency.\n\nTravelers with ATM cards bearing the CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Plus System network logos can withdraw cash in Aruban florins. Home bank accounts will be debited in dollars at a favorable exchange rate, and a 1% - 3% service charge will apply, depending on your credit card company. Before departing for Aruba, it's important to verify whether your PIN number will work in Aruba by calling 1-800-4-CIRRUS\n\nAruba is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone. You didn’t say what time zone you are in (Indiana is in two time zones).  If you’re in the Eastern time zone, Aruba is one hour ahead.\n\nPersons planning to visit Aruba as a tourist for a period not exceeding 90 days for the purpose of recreation, sports, health, family reasons, study, religious purposes or business must submit the following documentation:\n\n·A U.S. passport.\n·The necessary documents for returning to the country of origin (valid permanent resident document)\n·Proof of sufficient funds to stay in Aruba;\n·Return or onward ticket and other documents required for the next destination (visa etc.).\n\nNon-compliance with one of the above mentioned documentations might result in refusal of entry to Aruba. The immigration of Aruba based on the funds the tourist is traveling with shall determine the period of stay in Aruba.\n\nTo: Miss Demanda,\n\nHow many people are missing or killed here in the U.S. every year?

Last year there were two murders, I believe, and those were considered to be drug related and that was it. There were maybe six rapes.

The topic is highly complex and would need a lot of writing. Consult online searches. However, resolution in Macbeth is very ambivalent. He is an audacious warrior, he is tickled by the Weird Sisters' prophecy, but then falters when is about to assassinate his liege. It's only his wife, who makes him commit the murder. After that he looks resolute enough, but in fact events slide from his hands, have their own momentum, and what looks like resolution is only the desperate attempt to stay in charge. It is only in the very end, when he has to take on Macduff, when he understands that his situation is hopeless, that he regains his fighting spirit and, as it were, resolutely fights.\nDo not rely on the previous answers, which are misinformed.

"Generally, when we sleep, we sleep at nearly perfect peace.  Our bodies go into a state where our dreams take over our minds and we are unsure what is real and what is a figment of our imaginations.  Our heart rates and our breathing are perfectly controlled. There is a sense that nothing can harm us.  Then, suddenly and without warning, something occurs in the real (external) world that is so loud or otherwise disconcerting that, rather than easing back into consciousness as we normally do (absent an alarm clock or wake-up call), we are shocked back into alertness.  The shock and fear and annoyance that we feel then is what Dr. King alluded to in his speech.  Those citizens who expected that civil rights activism was a ""phase"" and that the downtrodden would eventually lose interest in being treated as equals were going to eventually have to confront their own shock and fear and annoyance when they suddenly realized that their presumption was false.\n\nIt almost sounded as if Dr. King's words were intended as a thinly-veiled threat of physical violence which, if so, would be an ironic choice for someone intimately associated with non-violent change.  But I believe that he was actually illustrating that non-violent change should never be confused with complacent inaction.  In other words, although he would never have incited the people to use physical force to achieve any means, the sheer power of non-violence non-cooperation could have an explosive impact on the nation as a whole if the people's demands were not met.\n\nLanguage and allusion was all part of Dr. King's genius."

At my high school, they prefered us to take languages instead of technology because colleges around us stressed the importance of the four main subjects and foreign language (most colleges require at least two years of a foreign language.)

"Ninoguapo also didn't use a spell-checker!\n\nThe answer is 702. Here's how to get the answer.\n\nThe other way to say what this question is asking is this: If the school is 45% boys and 55% girls (which we know), then that means that the 858 girls are 55% of the total number in the school.\n\n""But,"" you say, ""55% of WHAT????""\n\nYou can compare it using a ratio: 858 over ""some magical unknown number"" is the same as 55 over 100. So MULTIPLY 858 by 100, and then divide the answer by 55. That means the ""magical unknown number"" turns out to be 1,560...that's how many students there are in the school.\n\nTake out the girls (858) from the total (1,560) and you get...702. That's 45% of 1,560."

But then why do we start school so early?\n\nMy principal answered this question simply. Because there are after-school sports and clubs which rely on daylight for their practices. That seems like a pretty logical answer to me. I don't want to get up early, but now at least I understand why.
There are to many variables to answer absolutly, what weight of paper are you using? (20 pound, 25 pound, 18 pound), are you using A4 or standard US paper? glossy or matte finish?\n\nAll of these things are needed for an answer, but if I assume that you are using standard US 20 pound matte paper (like you buy for your office copy machine) then it weights roughly 6 pounds.  I will put the formula here later.  I have it at home (how strange is that?)\n\n** Edit **\n\nO.K.  I had the formula but now I don't.  Basically it is something like this:\n\nyou purchase 20 pound paper, well. . . that is the weight of 1,000 sheets of 11x17 (in the US) paper, also called the M Weight (M=1,000 cute, eh?).  Now, 1,000 sheets of 11x17 is 4 reams of 8.5x11 paper.\n\nSo 4 reams = 20 pounds then you divide it by 4 (20/4=5) so you have 5 pounds per ream.\n\nRemember that is for 20 pound white uncoated paper.  If you have colored paper or coated paper, it will change and you may not have 500 sheets in a ream. (some paper comes in 480 sheet reams)\n\nThis formula works for 24 pound, or 110 pound and anything in between.\n\nHope you have the info you need.  if you need more detail, let me know by leaving more in the question.
"It's a pronoun. A pronoun is basically a word for something, but only if you already know what that something is (Like she, him, her, they, these) because it's already given what they're talking about,\nAn adjective is a describing word\nand an adverb just ends in ""ly"" Like: Heartily, happily, grumpily, sexily. all that stuff.\nCheers."
"a point (job or position) that you can see and think you can attain but the 'glass' lets you see it but not get there.\n\nNot just women - white men that are short (5'6"" or less), and minotities even if there are more of them."
"Well, handshakes are typical. Men and women shake hands with men and women; there are no gender differences. Usually people just grasp hands--there is no holding the other's elbow, or clasping two hands.\n\nYou may nod heads with someone you know as an acquaintance, for example, someone you recognize at work but do not have much contact with. This guesture may be accompanied with a greeting like, ""Hi!"" or ""Hey!""\n\nBack-patting from what I've seen is done only between men who know each other and often is a fatherly gesture.\n\nI never see bowing.\n\nIn my experience, hugging usually only occurs with family members or good friends."
"People tend to learn best when they are using things that are more familar to them.  Language is so intimately tied to culture, identity, our history etc.  It allows us to fully express ourselves.  When we lose that ability, we lose so much more.  I believe it is important to maintain a native language.  I also believe in our ability to learn other languages. In doing so, we open up so many other worlds too.  To me, it's not a choice of ""one or the other"". . .it's the choice to learn more than what I already know, and to nuture what I already have."

trying to plagarize some essay material? *chuckle*
I think that all grades starting from middle school and ending in high school are hard if not very hard.  If I had to choose which grade was the hardest I would either say 8th grade, 9th grade, or 12th grade.  When your in 8th grade they ( the teachers ) are trying to get u prepared for high school, its the same thing with 12th grade, except when your in 12th grade they are preparing you for college and the life ahead of you.  In 9th grade you are just starting out in an new school.  Everything around you I would think is new to you.  I'm only in 8th grade and I think it is pretty hard so right now I would say 8th grade, but maybe in the future my aspect of the grades will change.  It depends on your aspect on life you cant rely on other people to tell you how hard something is, you just have to see for yourself.  It's up to you.

"No; the failure of a court system to convict a person does not logically imply that a person is truly innocent of the crime.  By the same token, the success of a court to convice someone does not logically imply that a person is truly guilty of the crime.  The courts do not seek to fully and logically prove things, only to establish them beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nSo, if the system is reasonably sure a person is guilty, they are punished.  If the system is reasonably sure a person is innocent, they are not punished.\n\nThe statement ""innocent until proven guilty"" simply defines the algorithm the government will follow in the case that it is not possible to reasonably determine whether a person is guilty or innocent.\n\nThe law isn't about strict logic as no empirical science can be, but is rather about fair and effective implementation of the law."

"TPCASTT is a way of analyzing a poem.\nSee the link below for how it works.\n\nT-Title - what does title mean *before* you read the poem.\nP-Paraphrase - put the poem in your own words.\nC-Connotation - what meanings are implied?\nA-Attitude - what is tone or attitude of speaker & poet?\nS-Shift - poem shifts, changes, develops\nT-Title - after reading, does title have other meanings?\nT-Theme - what *might* the poet be saying here?\n\nSo this is all about ""critical thinking"" -- teachers do not care about what YOU think about a poem. The purpose is to teach YOU to think and analyze.\n\nThe grand irony here is that TPCASTT is a formula and as Robert Frost wrote:\n\n>>\nYou get more credit for thinking if you restate formulae or cite cases that fall in easily under formulae, but all the fun is outside saying things that suggest formulae that won't formulate - that almost but don't quite formulate.\n>>"

"For years, Lonnie G. Johnson has been inventing thermodynamics systems for NASA and other organizations; but he has won his greatest fame for re-inventing the squirt gun.\n\nJohnson capped a childhood of tinkering with appliances in his senior year of high school, when he won a national inventing competition for ""Linex,"" a remote-control robot he had built out of junkyard scraps. He went on to more formal training at Tuskegee University, where he earned first a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (1972) and then an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1974). \n\nSoon thereafter, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Force, where he became an Advanced Space Systems Requirements Officer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Nebraska. After directing many projects and earning several decorations, as well as a Nomination for Astronaut Training, Johnson moved on to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Here he helped develop thermodynamic and controls systems for space projects, including award-winning work for the Galileo Jupiter probe and the Mars Observer project; his crowning achievement at JPL was the Johnson Tube, a CFC-free refrigeration system with a hydraulic heat pump, which later earned Johnson his seventh patent (#4,724,683; 1988). \n\nWhile with the USAF and JPL, Johnson continued to invent at home. In 1985, he founded his own company, later renamed Johnson Research and Development.. Johnson had first conceived his most famous invention in 1982: when a homemade nozzle at his bathroom sink shot a spray of water across the room, Johnson resolved to invent the world's first high-performance, pressurized water gun. \n\nJohnson with partner Bruce D'Andrade finally created a workable prototype of the now famous SuperSoaker® in 1989. They filed for a joint patent (granted 1991) and found a manufacturer, Larami Corp. (now a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.). The SuperSoaker® uses an air pump to pressurize its water supply, allowing for tremendous distance and accuracy in water-marksmanship. Those unfamiliar with this product cannot appreciate its popularity: since 1990, over 40 million SuperSoakers® have generated over $200 million in sales; today, dozens of websites are devoted to them. \n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has earned over 40 patents, and continues to invent in the realms of thermo- and fluid dynamics as well as toys. In addition to ongoing controls work for NASA, Johnson and his company are developing an improved home radon detector, a rechargeable battery, and a heat pump that uses water instead of freon, among other projects. \n\nLonnie Johnson has won numerous honors for his success in inventing and entrepreneurship, and his constant encouragement of young people to invent. He is a legendary businessman and public figure in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia---whose Mayor declared February 25, 1994 ""Lonnie G. Johnson Day"" in his honor---and, thanks to the SuperSoaker®, he is a hero to kids nationwide."

"A linear equation is an equation involving only the sum of constants or products of constants and the first power of a variable. Such an equation is equivalent to equating a first-degree polynomial to zero. These equations are called ""linear"" because they represent straight lines in Cartesian coordinates. A common form of a linear equation in two variables is \ny = mx + c \n(e.g. y = 3x + 5)\nIn this form, the value m will determine the slope or gradient of the line; and the value c will determine the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. Equations involving terms such as x2, y1/3, and xy are ""non-linear""."

Marcus Brutus: Roman senator and praetor who helps plan and carry out Caesar's assassination. Historically, Marcus Junius Brutus (84-42 B.C.) enjoyed a reputation in his day among Roman republicans as a noble and fair-minded statesman. However, his opponents–notably supporters of Caesar–regarded him as a traitor. First, Brutus sided with Pompey the Great against Caesar when the Roman Civil War started in 49 B.C. After Caesar defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, Greece, in 48 B.C., he pardoned Brutus and appointed him governor of Cisalpine Gaul in 46 B.C. and a praetor of Rome in 44 B.C. But Brutus turned against Caesar a second time, helping to lead the conspiracy that led to Caesar’s assassination in 44 B.C. Brutus believed the action was necessary to prevent Caesar from becoming dictator-for-life, meaning that all power would reside in Caesar and not in the delegates representing the people. In Shakespeare’s play, Brutus’s nobility and idealism gain the audience’s sympathy. But in the ancient Roman world of power politics, characterized by perfidy and pragmatism, it is his virtues that doom him. His downfall and death are the real tragedy of the play, not the death of Caesar.  \n\nWow, lot of info.  Definitely an interesting character--above quote from last link.

"Shirley Chisholm\nShirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm (November 30, 1924 – January 1, 2005) was an American politician, educator and author. She was a Congresswoman, representing New York's 12th District for seven terms from 1969-1983. In 1968, she became the first African American woman eto make a serious bid to be President of the United States.\n\nShe was born in Brooklyn, New York as Shirley St. Hill. she spent part of her childhood in Barbados with her grandmother, attending the local British-run school system. She later attended Brooklyn College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. While working as a teacher, Chisholm earned a Master's degree in elementary education from Teachers College, Columbia University. From 1953-1959, she was director of the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center, and from 1959-1964 was an educational consultant for the Division of Day Care.\n\nIn 1964, Chisholm ran and was elected to the New York State Legislature. She then ran as the Democratic candidate for New York's 12th District congressional seat and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1968. She defeated Republican candidate James Farmer, to become the first African American woman elected to Congress.\n\nAs a freshman, Chisholm was assigned to the House Forestry Committee. Given her district, she felt the placement was a waste of time and shocked many by demanding reassignment. She was placed on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Soon after, she voted for Hale Boggs as Majority Leader over John Conyers, even though Boggs was white. As a reward for her support, Boggs assigned her to the much-prized Education and Labor Committee; she was the third-highest ranking member when she retired.\n\nChisholm joined the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969 as one of its founding members. In 1972, Chisholm made a bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, and received 152 delegate votes, but ultimately lost the nomination to South Dakota Senator George McGovern. Chisholm's base of support was ethnically diverse and included the National Organization for Women. Among the volunteers who were inspired by her campaign was Barbara Lee, who would go on to become a congresswoman some 25 years later. Chisholm said she ran for the office ""in spite of hopeless odds,"" ""to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.""\n\nChisholm created controversy when she visited rival and ideological opposite George Wallace in the hospital soon after his shooting during that campaign. Several years later, when Chisholm worked on a bill to give domestic workers the right to a minimum wage, Wallace got her the votes of enough southern congressmen to push the legislation through the House. Throughout her tenure in Congress, Chisholm would work to improve opportunities for inner-city residents. She was a vocal opponent of the draft and supported spending increases for education, healthcare and other social services, and reductions in military spending. She announced her retirement from Congress in 1982, and was replaced by a fellow Democrat in 1983. After leaving Congress, Chisholm was named to the Purington Chair at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she taught for four years. She was also very popular on the lecture circuit.\n\nChisholm was married to Conrad Chisholm from 1949-1977. Upon their divorce, she married Arthur Hardwick, Jr., who died in 1986.\n\nShirley Chisholm was a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.

Uh... length? A novel is much longer. Besides that, there are some structural differences:\n\nA short story is more compact, and there is less room for character development. Author must choose to sacrifice plot points or development to keep his short story short. Often, short stories focus on only one, or at least very few central themes.\n\nA novel can be as long-winded as the author likes. Novels can incorporate a wide range of themes and ideas. There is unlimited room for character and plot development.\n\nThe difference lies in what the author must sacrifice in exchange for brevity.

"A natural monopoly is one that exists because of economies of scale rather than one created by a government to fill the need.\n\nTelephone companies, cable companies, et cetera are often local monopolies give sole license to operate within a city because the cost of deploying cables or wires to the home would be cost prohibitive for multiple companies to deploy, own and operated.\n\nMicrosoft is like a natural monopoly, despite some of their practices that some deemed anti-competitive, they have had competitors for decades.  For reasons of compatibility, operability, and cost, Microsoft became, for all intents and purposes, a monopoly because the consumers chose them by the product purchases they made.  Consumers were always free to buy an Apple computer, DR-DOS, WordPerfect, and any of countless other products.  However, they didn't because there was an economy of scale by being able to exchange Word and Excel documents, buy a computer from competing manufacturers which ran the same software, and purchase software written for Windows becuase it was too costly for the developers to write software for multiple platforms.  Thus it was ""natural"" rather than being given sole license by any particular governing body such as the US Government.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly"

"well, its obvious that there will be ""less trees"", i mean come on, ""deforestation"". But, for a more logical response, which I am sure is the one you are looking for, is that deforestation will cause an imbalance in the ecosystem. With deforestation, populations of animals are decreased, making some of those populations to migrate, and others to die as a result of their migration/deforestation. As a result, a kind of ""butterfly effect"" will occur, because now, these animals would have changed their behavior in order to adapt to their new environment. And even though some say that this would help the future of the ""human race"", it actually decreases its chances of survival. And why might you ask? well, its simple. Due to the ozone layer ""tear"" in the atmosphere caused by the 1970's and 80's and still today, increasing population and removing trees which supply oxygen will make the situation worse. Hint, we will be poluting our world and then all these years of hard work to stop the tear in the ozone layer will be pointless. Furthermore, a ""further"" tear in the ozone layer will allow the extremely powerful UV rays from the sun to enter, which not only would cause another adaptation by animals initially caused by deforestation, but it would completely destroy vegetation, and even ""us"", etc. therefore my main point is, dont ""de-forest"" ."

And don't lead a sedentary lifestyle - get regular exercise if you can, or if not that, at least incorporate more physical activity into your everyday routine.
Because Egypt was very dry, and relied mostly on the Nile River to water the crops, the Egyptians could only grow certain kinds of food. Mainly they grew wheat and barley. \n\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread and into soup and porridge, and they also added hops to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think the real reason that the Egyptians first began growing grain was to make beer. This is an Egyptian model of beer jars (from the Louvre), which the Egyptians made to put in your grave when you died so you would have beer in the next world.\n\n(from the Louvre, Paris, France)\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. You could go to a butcher shop and buy meat there, just as people do today. Only because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the courtyard of the store instead of inside. Here is a model of a butcher shop, also from somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? At the very bottom there is a whole leg of mutton.\nBut the Egyptians would not eat pigs (bacon or ham or pork or salami) because they thought pigs carried leprosy. They ate beef and mutton and duck and goose. \nFor dessert, the Egyptians liked to eat dates. This is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into somebody's grave for them to eat in the next world, and which were preserved in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up again.\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelons, and other kinds of melon.
"perhpas it was even before Rosa Parks, another young lady had done the same thing & it caused a stir & Rosa was trying to help her get legal help. In the meantime, Rosa made the same strategical move herself. In fact, there were many, many persons. Rosa decided to do this because she was attempting to help these persons get legal help & because she was a ""better candidate"" geven her age, being female, and her already standing associations with politics & church. Rosa is admired for what she did & deservidly so... but persons who want the whole story should have access to the whole story"
When you're doing homework, just remember it could be worse.  There have been days this year when I've attended classes and done homework from 9 in the morning to 4:30 in the morning.  Actually, for the most part, I love school... or I wouldn't do that. :-P\n\nI'm guessing your somewhere between 6th and 10th grade.  I can assure you that school gets much more enjoyable when you finish high school.  But that doesn't do you a whole lot of good for the time being.  Are there any subjects you like?  Do you dislike school because it's boring (i.e. too easy), or because it's too hard?  Homework in middle/high school tends to suck because it's primarily busy work.  Not a whole lot to do about that apparet from just not doing it (unless you actually do need the practice or the grade, in which case you should do it anyway).
We have to take the FCAT so teachers and other important people know how well you can read and do math. I agree with you about it being unfair. I so agree. But we got to do what we got to do. WHICH STILL IS NOT FAIR.

These are just my opinions.\n\nSpeed Mathematics - I think it's something you are born with. Can you practice and get faster? Yes, but never to the level of the geniuses that are born with it. \n\nSpeed Reading - Learned. I think that there are some people who are more apt at this kind of thing then others, but I think it's learned.\n\nPerfect Pitch - definitely you are born with it. There IS no learning perfect pitch (and that I know for a fact as I was a music major in college). You CAN learn to recognize and sing pitches that you want, but when you do, it is then called RELATIVE PITCH.

"Reminds me of Lois Lowry's book ""The Giver"". Read that to get a better feeling for utopias. It's short, >200 pages.\n\n=====\nMORE\n=====\n\nOk, so you read the Giver. Then, I would ask: ""At what price is the utopia achieved?"" The universe is balanced, so if you eliminate pain, suffering, and saddness you cannot retain joy, happiness, and desire. You have to wonder if life in a Utopian world would have any meaning. Remember what Walt Whitman said:\n\nO me! O life!... of the questions of these recurring;\nOf the endless trains of the faithless--of cities fill'd with the foolish;\nOf myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)\nOf eyes that vainly crave the light--of the objects mean--of the struggle ever renew'd;\nOf the poor results of all--of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me;\nOf the empty and useless years of the rest--with the rest me intertwined;\nThe question, O me! so sad, recurring--What good amid these, O me, O life?\n\nAnswer.\n\nThat you are here--that life exists, and identity;\nThat the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse."

The Congress is made up of two parts, called houses.  The Senate is the upper house and each state has 2 senators.  The lower house of the Congress is the House of Representatives. It is larger than the Senate because the number of representatives from each state depends on the state's population and is not set at a specific number.  Each house of Congress has varying responsibility and rights.  So, in short, the Senate is just one half of the Congress.

"The Château de Versailles —or simply Versailles— is a royal château, outside the gates of which the village of Versailles, France, has grown to become a full-fledged city. From 1682, when King Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in 1789, the court of Versailles was the center of power under the Ancien Régime. Those who are not French tend to call it the ""Palace""."

Before modern refrigeration, people kept food in cool cellars or lowered them into wells in a bucket. Even earlier, they stored food in caves and cold springs. Later, farmers cut large blocks of ice in winter and stored them in insulated icehouses, which were then used to preserve food in summer. Commercial icehouses delivered blocks of ice to homes and businesses in the cities until the advent of the modern, mechanical refrigerator in the 20th century.

When I first started college, I saw an advicer. I wanted to make sure I was taking the right classes for my degree. Then, after that, for two years I did. It was a waste of my time, and I knew what classes I needed. I did go see an advicer last week though just to do an evaluation, to see what classes I have left. But for the most part, in my opinion, its a waste of time.

"I don't know which one your looking for but here's a few(they are all famous in my book).\n\nMcCoy, Elijah\nElijah McCoy (1843 or 1844-1929) was a mechanical engineer and inventor. McCoy's high-quality industrial inventions (especially his steam engine lubricator) were the basis for the expression ""the real McCoy,"" meaning the real, authentic, or high-quality thing. \n\nMorgan, Garrett\nGarrett Augustus Morgan (March 4, 1877 - August 27, 1963), was an African-American inventor and businessman. He was the first person to patent a traffic signal. He also developed the gas mask (and many other inventions). Morgan used his gas mask (patent No. 1,090,936, 1914) to rescue miners who were trapped underground in a noxious mine. Soon after, Morgan was asked to produce gas masks for the US Army.\n \nRillieux, Norbert\nNorbert Rillieux (March 17, 1806-October 8, 1894) was an African-American inventor and engineer who invented a device that revolutionized sugar processing. Rillieux's multiple effect vacuum sugar evaporator (patented in 1864) made the processing of sugar more efficient, faster, and much safer. The resulting sugar was also superior. His apparatus was eventually adopted by sugar processing plants all around the world. \n\nWalker, Madame C. J.\nMadame C. J. Walker (December 23, 1867 - May 25, 1919) was an inventor, businesswoman and self-made millionaire. Sarah Breedlove McWilliams C. J. Walker was an African-American who developed many beauty and hair care products that were extremely popular. Madame Walker started her cosmetics business in 1905. Her first product was a scalp treatment that used petroleum and a hot comb. Sarah later invented a system for straightening hair. She added Madame to her name and began selling her new ""Walker System"" door-to-door. Walker soon added a hair-growing ointment and other cosmetic products to her line. The products were very successful and she soon had many saleswomen, called ""Walker Agents,"" who sold her products door to door. \n\nTo learn more click below:"

"The great thing about America is that laws can be changed to reflect evolving societal standards.  That's why there are Amendments to our Constitution.\n\nRemember that the 18th Amendment made sale and transport of ""intoxicating liquors"" -unconstitutional- in 1919. It was repealed by the 21st Amendment in 1933, thus making liquor sale and transport -constitutional-, once again.\n\nOf course, making a student-led prayer at school functions constitutional would require ""an act of Congress"", both literally and figuratively..but it could happen.\n\nNote that if Congress wants to reenact a law the Supreme Court has found unconstitutional, they can try to amend the Constitution — no easy feat, since an Amendment must be passed by two-thirds of both the Senate and the House, and then voted on by the states.\n\nEven the Supreme Court has reversed decisions.  Why do you think there's all the hoopla about a new conservative bent in the high court?  The fear that Roe vs. Wade will be reversed is on the mind of every pro-choice individual in the country.\n\nLaws are constantly being re-interpreted or changed."

From a website:\n\n    YOU ARE A SPARTAN! Be proud! You have endured unbelievable pain and hardship to become a superior Spartan soldier and citizen! Taken away from your parents at age 7, you lived a harsh and often brutal life in the soldiers barracks. You were beaten by older children who started fights to help make you tough and strong. You were often were whipped in front of groups of other Spartans, including your parents, but never cried out in pain. You were given very little food, but encouraged to steal food, instead. If caught stealing, you were beaten. To avoid severe pain, you learned to be cunning, to lie, to cheat, to steal, and how to get away with it! Some of you are members of the Spartan secret police and enjoy spying on slaves. If you find a slave who is showing signs of leadership, you have orders to kill them immediately. You are fierce, capable, and proud of your strength. You know you are superior and are delighted to be Spartan!  \n\n    SPARTAN GOALS AND BEHAVIOR AT THE OLYMPICS: Win at all costs. Lie, cheat, do whatever it takes. If you can't win, at least beat your archrival, those silly citizens of Athens. You are the proud and fierce Spartans! Dress alike with matching arm bands or buttons. Be loud but polite to your teacher who is your superior officer. Be on time. Be disciplined. Keep records. Make up a chant for Sparta, and chant it, while marching in unison, wherever you go. Make up a secret salute, and salute your fellow Spartans. Plot secretly with other Greek city-states to sabotage any Athenian chance at victory. Cheer only for your fellow Spartans at each event. Lie, cheat, steal, but do not get caught, because that is the Spartan way. Good luck at the games. \n\nhttp://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Greeklife.html#SPARTA\n\n    YOU ARE AN ATHENIAN!  Be courteous. You have been superbly educated in the arts and the sciences, and trained to be extremely productive and capable in times of peace or war. You are an achiever. Until age 6 or 7, you were taught at home by your mother, or by a male slave. From age 7-14, you attended a day school in the neighborhood where you memorized Homeric poetry and learned to play that magnificent instrument, the lyre. You learned drama, public speaking, reading, writing, math, and perhaps even how to play the flute. You attended four years of higher school, and learned more about math and science and government. At 18, you attended military school for two additional years! You are proud to be an Athenian! Famed for its literature, poetry, drama, theatre, schools, buildings, government, and intellectual superiority, you have no doubt that your polis, Athens, is clearly the shining star of all the Greek city-states.  \n\n    ATHENIAN GOALS AND BEHAVIOR AT THE OLYMPICS: You know your archrival, those horrible Spartans, will do anything to win, even lie and cheat, but you are Athenians - you would never stoop to such boorish behavior. Cooperate with your fellow Athenians to defeat those brutish Spartans, and do your personal best! Say witty things to impress representatives from other city-states. Be courteous to all Greeks, no matter what inferior city they represent. Make up a clever chant for Athens, and sing or say it each time an Athenian wins an event or a makes a witty comment. Shake hands with your fellow Athenians, whenever you greet them. You are Athenians, the clever, creative, courteous representatives of that shining example of all that is fine and noble, the polis of Athens. Good luck in the games! \n\nhttp://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Greeklife.html#ATHENS

"I think that the administration at your son's school should want take bullying much more seriusly. With all of the school shootings in the last couple of years, I don't know why they would want something like this to go unresolved. I would remind the administration of what happened at Columbine. If they don't want the same thing to happen at their school and it easily could, no school is safe! You may want to share with them the play ""Bang Bang You're Dead."" It is a play dedicated to ending school violence. Your son's school needs to get its students active AGAINST school violence. There should be zero tolerance for it!! Having the students put on this play could be a start to the education process. Also seek out other parents to go to the administration and take a stand. Contact the Parent Teacher Organization and educate them. They are not going to want to have their child potentially put in danger."

"I think you mean ""the Balkans,"" not balkan.\n\nHere is a little background on the start of World War I:\n\nOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was assassinated. He was murdered at Sarajevo, the capital of the Austrian province of Bosnia. The assassin was Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian-trained Bosnian terrorist. Austria claimed that Serbian government officials had trained and equipped Princip's group, which was known as the Black Hand. For many years Serbia and Austria-Hungary had been unfriendly because Serbian nationalists wanted to unite all Slavic peoples living in the Balkan region into a single state. Slavs living in Austria-Hungary would be included, and Austria-Hungary strongly opposed this.\n\nSo, as you can see, the Balkan region is where the tensions of the Bosnians and Serbs ignited the war.

The whole deal with New England was this - England and Europe were running out of natural resources such as lumber, coal, and other things.  Ships back then were made of wood, by people.  Most ships back then had an on-board carpenter and wood to make minor repairs, so ship-builders came across to New England on their own ships, and just started making more.  Even though ship building is an art that many countries didn't want to share, it's tough to live on a ship for years and not figure out how to build one.\n\nIn the movie, 'Master and Commander,' the original book had the Britons fighting the American Colonies and not the French, and it was an American ship that was invulnerable to the Briton's cannon fire.

bilbo's song for The Dúnadan\n\nAll that is gold does not glitter,\nNot all that wander are lost;\nThe old that is strong does not whither,\nDeep roots are not reached by frost.\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken,\nA light from the shadows shall spring;\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken,\nThe crownless again shall be king.

I went horseback riding through the farmlands.  The small town was a lesson also.

"For preparation:  Continue to make good grades, and don't get wrapped up in high school drama.  No college wants to admit a delinquent.  Play a sport if you can, participate in clubs or other activities.  If nothing else, volunteer. \n\nAs for choosing a college, you definitely need to start thinking about this already if you are 16.  You could organize yourself by making a few lists. \n\nFirst, write down everything that you HAVE to have in a college.  Ex:  public or private, small or large, urban or rural, top tier school or don't care, price range, certain programs, your girlfriend goes there, etc.\n\nWrite down everything that you ABSOLUTELY do not want. Ex: same as above\n\nAfter this, do some research.  There are websites to help you, or you can go to the library or Barnes & Noble and look at the 2006 colleges and universities book.  \n\nAfter you pick out schools, make sure you have at least the following: \n\n1 safety school\n1 favorite that you'll probably attend\n1 favorite that is kind of a stretch\n1 bigger stretch\n\nIf you're less of a risk-taker or can't afford that many, just have a favorite and a back-up safety school. \n\nKnow the SAT/ACT range needed for your schools of choice and retake the tests if necessary to hit close to the range. \n\nApply early!  Some colleges have ""early decision"" programs, where if you are accepted the fall of your senior year of HS.  Some colleges have rolling admissions, some make all of their decisions at one time. \n\nIf you need financial help, apply for government loans and research scholarships that are specific to your school.\n\nMost of all, just relax and stay organized.  College is a great time of your life!"

Not much more damage than it had done one hundred, two hundred or perhaps one thousand years ago.\n\nOur world has several natural disasters that have been occuring over time.  Nowadays, however, with the growing populace, the media coverage and the ability to share that media with everyone quickly, something as simple as a hurricane, tornado or even the eruption of a volcano becomes an overnight sensation.\n\nHurricanes actually do help, in civilized cultures, to improve detection and warning systems, as well as allow for new things to be rebuilt (and perhaps much better) after it does its damage.

"Non-violent resistance. I believe the protesters used to go into places, simply sit down, and refuse to budge. I've seen news coverage of the police lifting them and carrying them out bodily, still sitting.\n\nThink of the Freedom Riders (They peacefully integrated segregated busses, until they were forcibly removed), or the lunch counter sit ins.\n\nMarches. This showed the strength-in-numbers of the people who supported the cause, and rallied others to the cause. It also called public attention to the injustices.\n\nSpeeches. Dr King was an impassioned, eloquent speaker.\n\nI was a young child when all this was going on, but it had a profound effect on me. The emotional impact was HUGE.\n\nHow can you beat up somebody who simply wants to SIT ON A BUS??\n\nHow can you hate someone who wants only to SIT AT A LUNCH COUNTER??\n\nLOOK at that HUGE number of people marching in the street! They look like ANYBODY - some well dressed (like for church, or a business office, some in jeans or shorts and a t-shirt, they are old, young, women with babies, little kids, teenagers...). WHY would ANYBODY call them names, or hit them with billy-clubs, or beat them and kick them??\n\nAnd, even after the beatings and abuse, they CAME BACK, and did it AGAIN, and even MORE people joined them! \n\nSome of my first-grade teachers told us about going ""Down South"" for some of these demonstations. I was too young to really understand what they were talking about, but was left with the impression that this cause was vitally important, and very *exciting* and that people were doing something good about something very bad.\n\nListen to a tape of Dr King's ""I Have A Dream Speech.""

The Magdeburg hemispheres were one of Otto von Guericke's most interesting experiments, designed to demonstrate the air pump he had invented. They were two hollow copper hemispheres a little over a foot in diameter which fitted together so well that they could hold a vacuum. The air was pumped out from between them, and they were then held firmly together by the air pressure of the surrounding atmosphere.

I have nearly completed my training as a Certified Legal Assistant, so maybe I can answer part of that... Some basic skills you'll need are computer literacy, very good writing skills, above average reading comprehension, communication, written and oral and the ability to keep your mouth shut (You'll be required not to discuss cases with anyone who does not NEED to know, not even your friends, family or colleagues not working on the same case). Pre Law can't hurt, if it's available, and if a class is offerred on counselling, the interview skills you'd learn would be very valuable. You'll need to know a great deal about law in your state and how to research case-law. Your exact duties would depend on your employer and what area of the law you work in...for contract law, you would need an excellent eye for detail, good communication skills (Before a contract can be written, you must understand what the parties to that contract want and what they are willing to give.) and quite a lot of patience because if you are sloppy in writing a contract and your boss fails to thoroughly read it, it could cost your client.\nFor Litigation work, Criminal law or Appellate Law, Criminal and Civil, you'll to get very good at finding relevant case law and become a crackerjack interviewer. Other specialties highlight other skill sets.\nAs to salary, that varies broadly depending on where you live, what area of law you work in and what duties you perfom, but it is a living wage and often a very good living wage.\nWhat employers are looking for is diligence,reliability, attention to detail, eagerness to learn, good ethical sense and professionalism.\nIt can be a very stressful environment, particularly in a firm that encourages a quota of billable hours and some of the work is incredibly tedious (Summarizing a trial transcript is really snore city, but it's vital that such work be done well) but if the Law calls to you, you'll love it.\nGood luck.

"Pierre Trudeau is certainly the Prime Minister who is most remembered and brought about a great deal of positive change - a multicultural, tolerant, understanding, bi-lingual society, good protection of our health care system, and repatriation of the constitution while maintaining good relations with Great Britain.  He greatly valued education and supported post secondary studies.  He is also remembered for the strong stand he took when he enacted the War Measures Act.  His phrase, ""Just watch me"" is often quoted.  Pierre Trudeau was a true statesman, something we have not seen in prime ministers since him.  Paul Martin and Stephen Harper do not even come close to having the statesmanship, diplomacy, integrity, resolution or just plain charisma of Pierre Trudeau.  He will go down in history as one of Canada's greatest.\n\nTo choose a runner up to Pierre Trudeau it would have to be either Lester Pearson who won a Nobel Peace Prize, or John A. MacDonald, one of the fathers of Confederation."
Prepare adequately (study) for at least a week or more and don't stay up late each nite. Get plenty of rest on the day of the exam. Then on exam day, DO NOT EAT anything 1 hour before the exam. Eat something (high protein and non-greasy food only) 2 to 3 hours before the exam. Then right before the exam, drink soda pop (Mountain Dew or JOLT is preferred). This last advise is crucial. If you can't find any colas like Coke or Pepsi, drink honey mixed in water. You need the sugar, bottom line, specifically your brain. If you eat before the exam, your brain would be too busy to help you concentrate so eating before the exam is a no-no.

"Anna Eleanor Roosevelt \n\nA shy, awkward child, starved for recognition and love, Eleanor Roosevelt grew into a woman with great sensitivity to the underprivileged of all creeds, races, and nations. Her constant work to improve their lot made her one of the most loved--and for some years one of the most revered--women of her generation. \n\nShe was born in New York City on October 11, 1884, daughter of lovely Anna Hall and Elliott Roosevelt, younger brother of Theodore. When her mother died in 1892, the children went to live with Grandmother Hall; her adored father died only two years later. Attending a distinguished school in England gave her, at 15, her first chance to develop self-confidence among other girls. \n\n \nTall, slender, graceful of figure but apprehensive at the thought of being a wallflower, she returned for a debut that she dreaded. In her circle of friends was a distant cousin, handsome young Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They became engaged in 1903 and were married in 1905, with her uncle the President giving the bride away. Within eleven years Eleanor bore six children; one son died in infancy. ""I suppose I was fitting pretty well into the pattern of a fairly conventional, quiet, young society matron,"" she wrote later in her autobiography. \n\nIn Albany, where Franklin served in the state Senate from 1910 to 1913, Eleanor started her long career as political helpmate. She gained a knowledge of Washington and its ways while he served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. When he was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, she tended him devotedly. She became active in the women's division of the State Democratic Committee to keep his interest in politics alive. From his successful campaign for governor in 1928 to the day of his death, she dedicated her life to his purposes. She became eyes and ears for him, a trusted and tireless reporter. \n\nWhen Mrs. Roosevelt came to the White House in 1933, she understood social conditions better than any of her predecessors and she transformed the role of First Lady accordingly. She never shirked official entertaining; she greeted thousands with charming friendliness. She also broke precedent to hold press conferences, travel to all parts of the country, give lectures and radio broadcasts, and express her opinions candidly in a daily syndicated newspaper column, ""My Day."" \n\nThis made her a tempting target for political enemies but her integrity, her graciousness, and her sincerity of purpose endeared her personally to many--from heads of state to servicemen she visited abroad during World War II. As she had written wistfully at 14: ""...no matter how plain a woman may be if truth & loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her...."" \n\nAfter the President's death in 1945 she returned to a cottage at his Hyde Park estate; she told reporters: ""the story is over."" Within a year, however, she began her service as American spokesman in the United Nations. She continued a vigorous career until her strength began to wane in 1962. She died in New York City that November, and was buried at Hyde Park beside her husband."
Hi there, \n\nA very challenging question...There are many speculations regarding the extent of the universe. Some say that the universe is ever expanding with no boundary. And some say that it will expand only to a certain extent and start coming closer again to right back where it started from. But we never know!! It is said that the universe is made up of 'Dark Matter' , the composition of which has not been explained clearly till date. \n\nSo it is very difficult to theorize n state one particular answer for your question. I would suggest you read the book 'A Brief History of Time' by Stephen Hawking. It has many theories and facts. I'm afraid I haven't been of much help. \n\nrule wid style n luv@vinny

The sponsor is responsible for monitoring overall project performance on a periodical basis, and also for helping to resolve any large issues that the project manager is unable to resolve.  The sponsor sometimes ""champions"" the project in the organization.\n\nOther execs, who are not the sponsor, could be involved in project selection and prioritization, and overall monitoring/management of the project portfolio, and also establishing the overall project environment.  \n\nThey could also have functional managers reporting to them, and thus have the ability to affect how well the functional managers support the project."

The previous answer is correct, however, you can get it much easier by applying calculus.\n\nAs stated by the previous poster, \n\nR = QP = 10000P - 1.25 P^2\n\nThis function will have a maximum where its slope, (more properly, the slope of its tangent line) = 0.  That is, when a change in price causes the change in revenue to go from positive to negative, that's where revenue is highest.  Thus, we want\n\ndQ/dP = 0\n\ndQ/dP = 100,000 - 2 (1.25)P\n\n0 = 100,000 - 2.5P\n100,000 = 2.5 P\n\nP = 40,000.

I have a hard time understanding the enormouse pressure they sometimes put on their kids, mainly because it was missing in my childhood - I was always told I could be whatever I wanted.\n\nBut I know its there. And its hard to do something against your parents. But I must say its your life and your career. You go through school only once (or should), and its better spent preparing you for some kind of work that you'll love.\n\nThat is the only way you'll ever be happy with your job. The other option is to please your parents, and hate your future job, until you can't stand it anymore, and then finally decide you want to do whatever it is you've always wanetd to do, only you now have to go back to school, find a new job, etc.\n\nI don't know how to handle the parents - at some point you'd have to try to reason with them if that's even possible, or just decide to upset them, but I would find something I actually want to go into, something I have talent or know I'd be eventually good at, and would enjoy. It's your life.

It is all three, but people write best about what they know.  People write about their personal experiences.  The writing techniques can be learned, but I do believe that the ability to write in a way that interests others is a gift.  A good writer can tell a story about the simplest event and have it be interesting to the readers.  A good writer is talking to each reader personally.  \n\nGood writers are constantly listening and watching.  They have the ability to take what they hear and see and assimilate it and store it away for future use.  And most of all, good writers are always writing.  Here at Yahoo Answers is one of the places I get practice right now.  I write here everyday.  Feel free to have a look at some of my other answers - not all of them are examples of good writing as they are often written quickly and without deep thought.  However, I do write about what I know.  Good writers want to share what they know and are pleased when people read it.\n\nI hope my thoughts are of help.

Most likely it won't.  Would you rather be designing in a firm or managing a bunch of architects?  If you want to manage, then you will need an MBA.  If not, then a master's is all you need - go and get that job!
"The answer is in the word ""Manage.""  To manage means to keep things under control.  Conflict usually means things are out of control.  So a manager should attempt to avoid conflict at all times."
"Sometimes a particular text editor can't handle accented letters - for instance, if I were to read an E! Online story about Beyonce over on the Yahoo message boards, the last 'e' would always have the accent mark over it. However, it wouldn't show on Yahoo, so her name always read ""Beyonc."" Other times you'll see something similar to what you have in your question.\n\nIt's a compatibility/translation issue."

Very good question. I liked it very much.\n\nThe best way for remembering anything in Education is:\nMindmapping. Association. Try to associate with anything and recall. \n\nRevise as much as possible.\nIf possible Record on cd or tape those vocabulary and use Walkman or tape to listen in free time.\n\nYou can use this method for a lot of purposes.\n\nRemember: Those who ask about problem learns fast.
Sometimes I wonder what difference it would make if I put a full stop after an initial or not! I think the APA is just trying to establish an institution of academic excellence...very snobbish if you asked me!
I am a teacher and I still have this problem.  I've found that the only way to get better is to practice.  It started with me just reading out loud -- it's hard to do when you're used to reading in your head.  Then just reading in front of people (people you trust) is the next step.  A lot of teachers are moving around from having kids read in class for just this reason - when you know you're going to have to read out loud in front of your peers, it makes you nervous and you stop listening and paying attention and just get scared.  Build your confidence by doing it over and over.  Set small goals for yourself.  And remember, lots of people have this problem, it's not just you.

To evaluate a radiograph, you must ensure density and contrast are adequate, the image is free of motion and/or distortion (unless indicated by the projection), and all of the proper anatomy is visualized.  In the case of digital images, the expose factor (eg EI, S) must also be within range.\n\nTo diagnose a radiograph, see a radiologist. :-)

Computer aided manufacture is described as the interfacin of a computer with a machine tool or process to achieve automated operation. The early form of computer controlled automation was knoon as numerical control (NC) and allowed the control of modified, but otherwise traditional machine tools for metalworking application. The later came the system of Commonly knon as Computer Numerical Control (CNC). With the help of these manufacturing industy has sought to expand production methods that could overcome many of the limitations of mechanised mass production and the inherent standardisation of the goods.

Any degrees offered through accredited institutions of higher education are likely to be accepted as valid. There are standards that each school must meet to be accredited and employers look for this when choosing whether to hire someone based on the degrees they have. Degrees obtained from schools which are not accredited whether online or not are not likely to be accepted by employers. If you are looking into pursuing a degree online make sure you check out what kind of accreditations the school has. I have included a two good sources to reference in choosing schools that offer online degrees. Check them out.\n\nAlso if an employer isn't willing to accept your degree provide him with the schools accreditation. He may be afraid to take a risk but if he sees that the school is legit and accredited he too will be more likely to take that risk and to accept your degree as valid.

"It was pretty clear from the fact that you have asked this twice that you did not get the answer that you were looking for so here is my try !!!\n\nThe First Answers on the other question were good, but doppler was made a little bit clearer when put to me like this.When applied to Sound Waves.  Have you heard a train horn coming toward you then away from you? The same horn at first sounds higher in frequency as the waves are compressing together in front of the train. Then as it passes, goes away the same horn sounds lower in frequency because now the waves are stretching out, reaching us at a lower rate per second this is the doppler effect.  I only say a train because it is the only vehicle that usually single=horned you can hear clearly like this.  A car passing if it blows it's horn will create the same effect and do the exact same thing. It's just not so noticeable.\n\nDoppler is how the Police catch you speeding! The early radar units were actually calibrated by the officers in the field using the back and forth motion of a common music tuning fork! (The back and forth motion of a certain note represented a certain specific MPH).\n\nDoppler really only refers to the change of frequency reflected from the target. If it is higher, then the target is coming toward the receiving antenna. If it is lower in frequency, the target is going away from the receiving antenna. The more the frequency shift, the faster the movement. \n\nConventional radar only shows the return signal, and does not measure its frequency shift from that which was transmitted.\n\nHope this helps you.\n\nThats basic Doppler 101\n\nThere is a Display (if it is a Weather type Radar) , a Transmitter / Receiver ,  Waveguide ( looks like square hollow copper tubing, conducts the radar signal ), Feed Horn (connects waveguide to antenna)  Parabolic Antenna ( Focus signal into Feed Horn)\n\nBy the wayI just remembered in the days of space travel and satelites.  When we tune in satelites the frequencies change as the satelite moves due to this doppler effect.  Now during re-entry when speeds are greater the shifts are noticeable.  And you can actually tell a difference from a ground station on the same frequency!\n\nOh yeah by the way no big problems with doppler,  except that some operator could aim the darn thing wrong I guess and single out the wrong vehicle for speeding.  Guess he would be cross eyed!!!  Mistakes happen in just about every thing that is done everywhere!  But doppler is very accurate people make mistakes.  Some few Police are true JERKS most are just humans doing their job and are actually well meaning people trying to save lives!!!!  If you feel you are unfairly stopped for speeding, now I mean you were really NOT speeding, calmly talk to the officer and just see what he can do for you.  Explain Just BE CALM the worst thing will be he will give you the ticket!  The best he will give you a warning!  DO NOT ARGUE WITH HIM! Be sympathetic!  It will work.  OR HE IS A JERK!\n\nI AM NOT A JERK, AND I HAVE CARRIED A BADGE!\n\nHey have a good day. Hope I have helped you in some way!!\n\nOH YEA ... "" DRIVE CAREFUL HEAR ""\n\nAPS"

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Suicide is the most selfish thing that a person can do. They're only thinking of their own feelings and not of those around him. It sounds like he's using it to control you, and maybe keep you close to him out of fear of him doing it again. This fella needs some serious head help. He needs to be checked into a safe place, where he can get daily help, in a controlled setting. If he can't get that, then he needs to get regular appointments with a head doc. The best thing you can do for him is to encourage him to get help. Let him know that you and him don't have a future unless he works through his deeper issues first. If he theatens to do himself in, let him go. It's really out of your hands. He'll either do it or not. If he does, it's not your fault. I know this sounds cold and uncaring, but you have to draw the line. You can't let him control your feelings, especially using fear. That's not love. That's the biggest turn-off too. How can something so dramatic want to make you stay with him? It's the same thing for your step-mom. There was nothing you could have done to save her from doing what she did. It was selfish and thoughtless. Suicidal people don't think through the whole situation. They have tunnel vision, and are only focussed on how THEY feel. It has nothing to do with you, even if they say it does. We make our own choices. I hope you choose what's healthy for you. <*)))><

"Erikson, Erik - Pioneering PSYCHOANALYST, much interested in the development of the person throughout the lifespan, rather than simply during childhood. In this respect he differed from other influential theorists such as Sigmund FREUD and Jean PIAGET. Erikson argued that there existed ""eight ages of man"", each of which had its own characteristic ""crisis"" (a term which he used in a less negative sense than one might naturally understand it. The crisis of the infant up to the age of eighteen months, for instance, is trust/mistrust of the primary caretaker (usually the mother); the crisis of the ""later years"" is integrity vs. despair. Particularly influential is Erikson's theory of adolescence, which he believed to be characterised by integrity vs. role confusion. Although many of Erikson's theories have been influential, they have nevertheless also been criticised for their unproveability."

Uniforms convey many non-verbal meanings.  \n\nNamely, they are the primary way customers identify employees.  When you enter a store, for example, and need help, you're likely to turn to the person wearing the proper colors/uniform.\n\nIn addition, uniforms show solidarity with the employer.  In other words, they indicate the employee's willingness to submit her will/individuality to the needs/desires/requests of her employer.\n\nUniforms also heighten customer awareness of the corporate logo (since every uniform has it) and decrease the need for employer's monitoring of employees' dress.

"I'm not exactly a scholar of Arkansas state law, put a prenup is, first, a contract.  So it has to have all the same things a contract does.  The parties have to understand it, agree to it, and each give up something of value.  All of its terms have to be written down and it has to be sufficiently detailed so that it's not an ""agreement to agree.""\n\nPrenups are frequently signed between people of unequal power - one wealthy, one less so.  For that reason, most states will insist that the parties be given some extra rights.  Each must have access to an attorney, ample time to consider the prenup, and must have received fairly complete disclosure about the finances of the other.  One or more of these may be waived but the more unequal the position of the parties, the less likely courts will be to allow such waivers. \n\nSome states also require prenups to be sworn and notarized, a requirement not necessary for your average contract.\n\nAnd couples will have a hard time making an agreement about child support and visitation.  These issues are almost always open for the courts to re-decide them."

Why Would One Want to Be an Addition Symbol?\nSince you did already a good job, let me try to help you out, if you like this. \n\nMy recommendation is thinking outside the box, if this is appreciated in your school. You may want to think of what the addition symbol stands for in other areas! Think of architecture, children's play, mythology, religion etc. If you get going, you could write an entire book on this little symbol!\n\nExamples: The addition symbol as such is very balanced: the horizontal line is equal to the vertical line. In symbolism the horizontal line stands for the earth and the vertical line for heaven. The addition symbol unites heaven and earth. I like to be balanced and feel oneness. \n\nThis symbol also stands for the four directions in Native American symbolism, it indicates the four directions of the wind, and the wind is fee. I like to be free. It also stands for the four corners of the world, which means, it expands worldwide, is not limited, and I like this.\n\nWhen tilted 45 degrees, it becomes the solar cross, indicating the points of sunrise and sunset (solstices) in the year and stands for the sun. It is nice to be like the sun: warming and enlightening the earth and allowing life to grow.\n\nYou may want to find your own additional reasons why you want to be an addition symbol. \nKeep up the good works and have fun!\n\nCordially, India.Magica

Paris Reidhead\n1919-1992\n\n     Paris Reidhead devoted his life to communicating the message of the Gospel in America and throughout the world. A student pastor in the rural Minnesota at age eighteen, Mr. Reidhead felt led of the Lord to overseas mission work. In 1945, Paris Reidhead and Marjorie, his wife of two years, traveled under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission to the Sudan-Ethiopia Border where they surveyed and analyzed tribal languages in preparation for evangelism and education in this area.\n\n     Upon his return to the United States, Mr. Reidhead was appointed Deputation Secretary of the Sudan Interior Mission in the Southeastern United States. He was soon a nationally recognized spokesman for missions.\n\n     In 1953 Mr. Reidhead began his national Bible Conference ministry for the Christian and Missionary Alliance which brought him, in 1956, to pastorate of the Gospel Tabernacle, the New York City church where the C & M A was first established by Dr. A. B. Simpson in 1887. While in New York, Mr. Reidhead drew on informational resources at the United Nations to pioneer a program through which government and private funds were used for economic development in the Third World; his efforts to implement local programs on this model took him to mission fields in Africa, Asia, and South America.\n\n     Third World development became his full-time commitment in 1966. Mr. Reidhead's vision of public-private funding for economic development led, in 1971, to the formation of the Institute for International Development, Inc. which has served as the model for about ninety evangelical organizations which have, in turn, channeled more than 100 million dollars into Third World development. In 1984, Mr. Reidhead founded Enterprise Development International, a service agency devoted to aiding Third World church and evangelical agencies in creating job opportunities for destitute families.\n\n     Since Mr. Reidhead's death in 1992, Bible Teaching Ministries, Inc. continues under the leadership of his wife, Marjorie, and daughter, Virginia Teitt, and a dedicated Board. The message of the Gospel is reaching an ever-widening audience all over the world

"Heracles married King Creon's daughter, Megara. However, Hera drove Heracles into a fit of madness during which he killed his wife and children. Upon realizing what he had done, he fled to the Oracle of Delphi. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King Eurystheus for 12 years and perform any task which he required, resulting in The Twelve Labours of Hercules.\n\nThe Twelve Labours (Greek: dodekathlos) of Heracles (Latin: Hercules) are a series of archaic episodes connected by a later continuous narrative, concerning a penance carried out by Herakles, the greatest of the Greek heroes. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an epic poem (now lost) written by a certain Peisandros of Rhodes, perhaps to be dated about 600 BCE (Burkert).\n\nAs they survive, the Labours of Herakles are not told in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples (pp 169–170) assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were sited in the Peleponnesos, culminating with the rededication of Olympia and six others, part of the same sequence, took the hero farther afield. In each case, the pattern was the same: Herakles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Hera's representative Eurystheus a magical animal or plant. ""The sites selected were all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld"" (p 169)."

"The answer to this question is the Fifth Ammendment to the United States Constitution. You, as a citizen or resident of the U.S.,  have the right to be free from self-incrimination. However, law enforcement has the right to conduct criminal investigations regardles of whether the suspect is a minor or an adult. I'm sure you've heard on TV, ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used as evidence against you in criminal proceedings."" This is a mandatory statement used by law enforcement officers to allow a criminal suspect to know that he is a suspect, but he does not have to answer questions or make statements that would incriminate himself. The only difference when it comes to interviewing minors is that they have the right to have a parent or legal guardian present during any questioning. Furthermore, law enforcement officers may not threaten or coerce information form a suspect. In other words, if I beat you for three hours while you were wearing handcuffs, locked in a 95 degree room, and hungry and thirsty, I would have you confessing to Kennedy's assassination, which we can all deduce is probably not true. Statements made from coercion or threats are not admissible in criminal courts. As law enforcement officers, we can ask anything we want to receive the information we need, so long as we don't physically or mentally harm someone. But the Fifth Ammendment says you don't have to answer. Hope this helps."

extraterrestrials vastly influence our community.\nthe truth is, in the 50s under president Eisen Howard our government was contacted by extraterrestrials offering technology for people. the deal was accepted with the condition that the ETs always let our government know who they would take and that those would be returned.  This explains the boom in domestic technology and alien abductions in the 60s
"It's me again!  I think this is a facinating topic.  I think home schooling can be very beneficial.  I am glad I was not homeschooled though, as a value the memories of my high school experience.  \n\nMy step-mother home schools her children.  Her oldest son, my little brother (who is now 16) went to public school until the 1st grade.  She decided to home school him (and the rest of her children that followed) because she did not like the school teaching the students about Halloween.  She believes this to be a day of Satan.  (That's another topic altogether)\n\nMy main concern for her home schooling my siblings is that, although, my step mother is a lovely person- she's not that smart.  I suppose she is learning more about history, math and grammar as she goes along, but she really is flakey.  Simple would be a good word for her.\n\nShe tells me that I HAVE to home school my children when I have them.  I told her that I personally don't feel qualified to be a teacher (which isn't true, but I felt it was the only way for me to tell her I don't want to do that without hurting her feelings) and she actually told me that ""It's not about education it's about loving your children longer.""\n\nThe good aspects of home schooling can be things like more one on one time with the ""students"", class time is in a controlled environment, field trips whenever you want, honing in on a child's best subject to really develop what the child is good at doing, etc... I'm sure most home schooling parents are quite capable.\n\nThe negatives are slightly more superficial, but those can be missing out on extra-curricular activities like playing for your school's team, being on a debate team, going to dances, passing notes in the hallways, pep rallies, etc... those things are important too.  (my half-sibling do play for a soccer team, but they will never know the feeling of school pride, wearing the school's colors etc...)\n\nI also feel time apart from one's parents for a few hours a day with one's peers is important.  Sure, there are activities home school kids get to go to without their parents, but in a school environment, there's the aspect of being expected to make decisions and mistakes without having mom and dad right there.  My sister is 15 and still doesn't like being away from her mom- ever.  She told me that her mom told her that she never has to leave home- for college or to get a job if she doesn't want to.  I think she is too dependent, and it worries me.\n\nAll in all, I am not against home schooling, it's just not something I want to do with my future children.  I applaud all those who have the time, patience and the financial freedom to be able to do it."

I didn't go to a HBCU. People should go to the school that meets the qualifications that they've set forth as being priorities. Having in-state tuition at a public university was a big determining factor for me, and unfortunately, there are no HBCU's in the state of Illinois. Hence, I went to a state school.\n\nIf the guy continues to give you crap regarding this, tell him that for most people, the workplace consists of a majority of non-African-Americans, so it was invaluable to learn how to interact with other races and ethnicities on both a personal and business level. And unfortunately, you can't get that knowledge from an HBCU.

"Grizzly Adams is the main character from The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams, a 1974 film. He is a woodsman who fled into the mountains when he was wrongly accused of murder. While struggling to survive, Adams discovers an orphaned grizzly bear cub whom he takes in and calls Ben. The bear, despite his huge adult size, becomes Adams' closest companion.  In the end, Adams proves his innocence.  The title character was loosely based on an actual hunter, James ""Grizzly"" Adams (October 12, 1812–October 25, 1860)."

Biology is a dime a dozen.Almost anywhere you go will have the same program of any other school. If you want to major in marine biology make sure you attend a school in a coastal area as they tend to have the best programs. For genetics Sarah Lawrence has an excellent school. It is a graduate degree program but if you are interested in their genetics program then I suggest studying biology there as well. Chemistry-North Carolina State University does research programs and has a good program. Good luck!

There is a major talent shortage in that field.\n\n2.  Nursing (at the RN level) is a field constantly in demand.  Furthermore, pay and benefits are, generally, very good.\n\n3.  Computer repair, which requires less university level training, is another field with a continuing shortage of talent.\n\nPerhaps it would be helpful for you to browse through some of the employment sites online.  You would certainly get a good overview of which fields have job openings that may interest you.  You could start with Yahoo's Hot Jobs, MSN jobs site, Monster.com, Wall Street Journal's CareerBuilder, www.craigslist.org  and so on.\n\nBest of luck with whatever new endeavor you choose!

"I would say that you were intelligent, except you spelled ""divided"" wrong."
The Egyptian pyramids were built using an enormous labour force - ordinary citizens served for a few months of each year to work as well as full time craftsmen who worked to build the monuments.  Typically, a king began construction of his pyramid complex soon after ascending the throne and construction continued until his death.\nThe earliest pyramids were solid stone structures.  After a sight was selected and prepared, the foundation was laid with large blocks being dragged in on sledges - a sort of sled-like vehicle.  As the pyramid rose, a ramp was used to move blocks into place higher up the structure.  Frequently, local stone was used for the interior blocks of the pyramid and finer stone was brought from special sources for the exterior casing of the pyramid.\nIn later pyramids, the core was frequently not of solid stone but of rubble or mudbrick with an outer facing of nicer stone.  Eventually pyramids were constructed primarily of mudbrick rather than stone.

It does depend one where he's at on the spectrum, but it also depends on what you're talking about as far as what he does. As with any child, the form of discipline depends on the actions causing the discipline. Especially at 1 1/2, that's a tough one. My almost 4 yr old is autistic, he was just starting to really show signs at 1 1/2. You can do timeouts, but you might have to sit there with him if he doesn't understand he's supposed to stay there. If you're talking about tantrums, that's a fun one! The best way to handle the tantrums at that age is one of two ways. The first way was given to me by a special ed teacher. Place him on your lap facing out, and gently but firmly hold his arms until he stops. This works if he's hurting himself or others, like mine was. It was the only way to keep him from biting himself and drawing blood or digging his claws into himself. The other way is less extreme, it's for when he's tantruming but doesn't hurt himself. Make sure he's out of everyone's reach and just let him do it. Keep in mind, they can last a long time, mine would usually go for 30 min. a piece. Usually, they're in such a rage when it happens that they don't even know you exist, so disciplining him while he's doing it won't do any good. Believe me, I tried! When he gets a little older, you can use the happy face/sad face. This is working WONDERS for my son now, but it wouldn't have then. If he can stop himself from having a tantrum before it starts, or if he can do what I ask without fighting, he gets a happy face. If he tantrums or fights me, he gets a sad face. At the end of the day, before he goes home, give him a special treat. If he likes trains, find some train stickers, etc. This is helping Tim to learn self-control, to stop himself and get control before he's out of control. Again, depends on how severe this little guy is as to whether or not he can comprehend a reward system.
I would guess you are asking how the book shows conformity. To that I would have to point out that in the book there is little to no reading material. The people only see art through their television which is run by the government. Without seeing any creativity through either written form or other artistic outlets, a person would not have any thoughts against their given reality. \n\nThe book runs along the same lines as the movie 1984 which also has the theme of destroying all manner of creativity and controlling the population through created and fabricated information. \n\nThe book does show though that even though people can be fed false information, eventualy (in the case of the main character) they will reject their created reality and will go off in search of the truth. Much the same happend in the movie 1984 and other similar big brother style movies and books. Even the popular movie The Matrix has similar ties in that people are forced into a fabricated reality and over time many come to believe something is wrong with their existance and question what is real and what is not.
it means that without the common bond of language, that none of the ideas/products would be communicable--nothing would transfer or move. And since globalization is all about the movement of ideas/services/people/products from one place to another, this would be impossible without language.

"Maria Montessori's desire to help children was so strong, however, that in 1906 she gave up both her university chair and her medical practice to work with a group of sixty young children of working parents in the San Lorenzo district of Rome. It was there that she founded the first Casa dei Bambini, or ""Children's House."" What ultimately became the Montessori method of education developed there, based upon Montessori's scientific observations of these children's almost effortless ability to absorb knowledge from their surroundings, as well as their tireless interest in manipulating materials. Every piece of equipment, every exercise, every method Montessori developed was based on what she observed children to do ""naturally,"" by themselves, unassisted by adults. \n\nChildren teach themselves. This simple but profound truth inspired Montessori's lifelong pursuit of educational reform, methodology, psychology, teaching, and teacher training--all based on her dedication to furthering the self-creating process of the child."

You need to establish for what purpose they are learning English. There are threee main areas to language; speaking, & listening, reading then writing.  It takes longer for non native speakers to sound native once they reach around age 12, on the other hand the true second languge learner (one who already reads, write and composes in correct gramatical form in their native language) will be able to comprehend and produce more content area language than younger learners.  Younger than 12 year olds will sound more like native English speakers at an amazing rate but may have little to no idea what they are saying. If your Spanish speaker already is a literate Spanish language learner there will be alot of transfer (translation & relation) to their native language.  The easiest thing to do is find out what they know alot about that you also know alot about (perhaps the Bible, Hollywood movies, music) and do lessons/conversations around this topic.  Provide as much illustrations and props as possible.  Good luck from a second language learner & teacher=:
"Our parish was one of the first in the U.S. to be named in honor of St. Pius X, the ""Pope of the Eucharist."" He was so named because he established reception of the sacrament of the Eucharist by children. His life, in part, was modeled after St. Vincent de Paul with the deep understanding that ""the will of God is not to live for oneself, but for all others."" \n\nBishop Edward A. Fitzgerald, Bishop of Winona, established the Church of St. Pius X on July 1, 1954. Msgr. Warren J. Ryan was appointed the first pastor and was responsible for the planning and development of the parish facilities during the first nine years. The first liturgies were celebrated at Miracle Mile Shopping Center, which served as a temporary church until March 1955. From that time until August of 1955, services were held in Lourdes Chapel at Assisi Heights. The fist Mass was celebrated in the social hall (Kennedy Hall) of the new church Roncalli Hall), on the feast of St. Pius X, September 3, 1955, and at that time the combination school and church building were formally dedicated by Bishop Fitzgerald. The cost of the three structures (Kennedy Hall, Roncalli Hall, and the parish rectory) was $245,000.00. The church had a seating capacity for 600. The social hall could seat 400, and was used for basketball, school lunch, and social gatherings, much like it is today. The parish rectory was originally just one story. \n\nThe school (built at a cost of $250,000.00) was opened for the first classes a year later in September 1956 with an enrollment of 325 students in grades one through eight. Preliminary plans included construction on only eight classrooms, but demographic studies indicated much growth, prompting a decision to expand the school size to 20 classrooms. The school would eventually include 19 classrooms, a library, an office and nurse's room, to serve up to 750 students. \n\nDuring the parish's first pastorate, that of Fr. Ryan, the parish grew from 300 families to 800 families. Besides the erection of the combination church and school, the rectory and convent were completed and preliminary plans were made for the new church. During the next eleven years, St. Pius X continued to grow in numbers and facilities, and soon became the largest parish in the Diocese of Winona. The new church was erected at a cost of $404,000.00 in 1964."

"Okay.  There is a misunderstanding here.\n\n""Dumb"" people, or ""unintelligent"" people, for our purposes, are NOT necessarily unmotivated.  Some of them work very hard and really care about what they can/cannot do.  They make an effort to the best of their ability, which is admirable.\n\nI think you're talking about slackers, people who might be able to do well but just don't put in the effort.  And well, it's hard to motivate them.  They sort of have to find the motivation themselves.  You could take away privileges, the time-old method, but a lot of times that will just make them angry and they will be even worse.\n\nTry encouraging them, telling them what they could be capable of if they tried.  If they don't care, well, they don't care -- at least not yet.  My feeling is that somewhere along the line, maybe middle school, maybe high school, maybe college if they go... they'll find the motivation themselves.  They're not going to believe anything you say until they discover for themselves."

"It's not your job to change people. It is your job to teach and guide them. As  a teacher you should be open to having your students come and talk to you if they choose so. Sometimes a child feels they don't have anyone to go to and as a teacher you should be able to guide them in the right direction even if it be another person to help them. A child spend alomost as much time if not more at school then at home. The parents have no choice but to trust that you are going to put some heart into your job as well as the books. So no I don't think that extra patience is enough to be honest. It is not your job to give out dating advice nor is it your business to be getting involved in such a private aspect of the childs life unless it is extreme and the parents need to be told. Most teens want to date, and they are not mature enough to be looking for ""the one"" but it is part of growing up. You get paid to teach yes but you also get paid to listen to your students and helo them when they are in need. Knowing that i have to put my son into school in a few years scares me, simply because anymore teachers don't care. They simply want to go in open the books and go home. Children need to be guided through the years and if you work in a postion where you are going to be a huge part of that childs daily life then you are just as responible for some of the outcome. If a child is being abused it is your job to say something about it or contact the proper authorities, but it is not your job to get involved in private aspects of thier lifes otherwise unless they show you that it is ok for you to do so. Some people are open and some are more private. I had a few great teachers growing up that made a huge difference in my life and it didn't come from what they taught in class in came from the heart."

Main Entry: el·lipse \nPronunciation: i-'lips, e-\nFunction: noun\nEtymology: Greek elleipsis\n1 a : OVAL b : a closed plane curve generated by a point moving in such a way that the sums of its distances from two fixed points is a constant : a plane section of a right circular cone that is a closed curve\n\nSolar system woul;d be a good example of an elleipsis, the planets revolve around the sun, the fixed point.\n\nHow about the shape of a tanker truck, or the shape of the world itself. \n\nELLIPSE\n\nAlthough the circle is a very common shape, most of the time when we see a circle, it doesn't look like a circle! Because we usually see circles from an angle...and the shape then isn't perfectly round, it's another mathematical curve called an ellipse.One description of an ellipse is a squashed, stretched or otherwise distorted circle. \n\n\n \n\nAn ellipse can be seen as a slice of a cone, but it can also be seen when you tilt a glass partially filled with water or juice.\n\nUnlike a circle, whose shape never changes, there are many different shapes of ellipses: long narrow ones ... and rounder ones. \n\nDraftsmen have templates that enable them to draw the correct shape of ellipse for any use. We call the vertical and horizontal lines (shown in red below) the axes; the major axis is the longer of the two ... but it isn't necessarily the horizontal one.\n\n\n \n\nThe relationship between the major and minor axes determine the shape of the ellipse. The mathematician's word for shape is this case is eccentricity, and refers to the curvature. It is closely related to the ratio between the lengths of the two axes ... If the major and minor axes are equal, the ellipse is a circle. Shall we define an ellipse as a distorted circle, then, or the circle as a special case of the ellipse? Either one would be reasonable and useful.\n\nThe shape of the ellipse makes it more useful in some instances than the circle: since it is longer than it is wide it forms a comfortable shape for your hand ... It is a stable shape: a tank truck is in the shape of an ellipse. If it were circular, it would be taller than it is wide and then be top-heavy. A circle would have given it a larger capacity however, for the circle has the greatest area for a given perimeter, and is therefore the most economical container.\n\n\n\n\nAnother way of defining an ellipse is as one of four curves called The Conics, that can be cut from a cone. A, cone sliced parallel to the base has a circular cross-section, but if we angle the slice the result is an ellipse. Varying the angle changes the eccentricity of the ellipse. You will also get ellipses if you slice a cylinder.\n\n\n\n\nThe conical beam of light from a flashlight casts an elliptical pattern of light on the wall when held at an angle. If we move the point of the cone further away, an angled slice will still give us an ellipse: no matter how far we move the point of the cone. Imagine the point as far away as infinity...the cone becomes a cylinder and we still have an ellipse in cross-section.\n\nSalami is often cut in elliptical slices ... and tilting a glass of soda to drink with our salami would reveal yet another ellipse! Any cylinder sliced on an angle will reveal an ellipse in cross-section, such as seen in the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen:\n\n\n \n\n\nhttp://www.astro.ku.dk/~lars_c/tbp/tychoeng.html \n\nThe mathematical definition of an ellipse is the set of all points such that the sum of the distances from two fixed points is constant. The distance from any point of the ellipse to one focus plus the distance from that same point to the other focus is always the same number for a particular ellipse: seven in the example below. Two plus five equals seven ... three plus four equals seven ... three and one-half plus three and one-half equals seven.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use this definition to derive an equation for an ellipse with its center at the origin on a Cartesian coordinate sy
"On the average, people prefer to have things explained to them as they happened rather than in order of importance or in chance sequence.  For example, if your 3rd grade son were assigned a ""What did you do on your summer vacation?"" paper, you would probably direct him to start his paper describing what he did on the first day of vacation leading up to the last.  But, maybe he went to Disneyland in June and stayed home with the flu in August.  The climax of his paper would occur at the very beginning and it would end very uneventful, falling quite short of a Pulitzer prize winning essay.  Narratives are often written in this same predictable way which can take the element of surprise and mystery out of the novel.  In her Love Medicine series, Louise Erdrich takes her readers out of that chronological comfort zone and forces them to meet and learn about her characters in a random, almost senseless, order which results in magically creating an experience for her non-Native American readers that is somewhat akin to Native American spirituality.  \n\n  \nEach chapter in each of Erdrich's books is narrated by a different character who tells the reader about themselves or an experience that he or she has encountered.  Not only are the characters introduced randomly, but their experiences are also arranged in no particular order within these novels.  If this isn't confusing enough, the order in which Erdrich wrote the books is in the same erratic sequence: Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, Tracks, and finally The Bingo Palace.  If one were to read the books in chronological order, they would read them in the following order: Tracks, The Beet Queen, Love Medicine, and The Bingo Palace.  \n\n  \nAlthough I grew up in central North Dakota, seventy miles from an Indian Reservation, I have had little experience with Native American culture and beliefs. The few Native Americans in my hometown had been ""Americanized,"" knowing little, if anything at all, about their native ancestry.  The mystery and magic of Native American spirituality has been something that I have never understood or even attempted to understand.  Despite my ignorance and total absorption in my own little, conformist WASP world, Erdrich was able to draw me in and make me a part of the untamed, passionate, and regrettably almost extinct lives and culture of North Dakota's Chippewa.  At least for the length of time it took me to complete Erdrich's series, I felt a part of and truly believed in the magic and spirituality that these people have.  \n\n  \nAs I mentioned earlier, the order in which Erdrich wrote each of these books and even the order of each chapter in each book is sporadic and unpredictable.  I read them in the order that Erdrich wrote them; and not unlike the average reader would, I resisted it at first.  It didn't take long before I surrendered and willingly let Erdrich transport me into the wild and spiritual world of the North Dakota Native American. I strongly believe that the order in which I read her books intensified the effect.   \n\n  \nThe character that is most enhanced through reading Erdrich's books in this order is Fleur Pillager.  Erdrich first introduced this enigmatic character to the world as an old woman in Love Medicine.  In a chronological timeline, this book would be third in line. However, it was the first book of this series that Erdrich wrote.  In this novel Fleur is portrayed as a legend whose name most of the other characters are afraid to even breath without consequence because she ""was known for putting the twisted mouth on people, seizing up their hearts"" and casting other dreadful spells on those who wronged her (Love Medicine 241).   \n\n  \nYoung Lipsha's Grandmother wants Lipsha to procure a love potion for her to use on her cheating, half senile husband.  However, the only woman who knows the secret to ""love medicines"" is Fleur.  Fleur is a descendent of the mo"

No, there have been plenty of research to suggest that this scale is not the only one that can measure brainpower and potential. They took 3 groups of students, the first had IQ - 100-120, the second 120-140 and the third 140-160 and they gave them some reading assignments. What they found was that in some of the cases, the group with lower IQ actually was able to do better (for example in questions that required some more of an accurate investigate thinking and not just individual intellect). What's interesting is that the IQ chart is not currently used by any educational institution as the basis for admission or any other privileges.

There is more than one philosophy about teaching ESL.  However, if you need the student's L1 to explain a word or an activity, then you are trying to do something too difficult for them.

To find a solution for an equation, we can use the basic rules of simplifying equations. These are as follows:\n \n1) You may evaluate any parentheses, exponents, multiplications, divisions, additions, and subtractions in the usual order of operations. When evaluating expressions, be careful to use the associative and distributive properties properly. \n\n2) You may combine like terms. This means adding or subtracting variables of the same kind. The expression 2x + 4x simplifies to 6x. The expression 13 - 7 + 3 simplifies to 9. \n\n3) You may add any value to both sides of the equation. \n\n4) You may subtract any value from both sides of the equation. This is best done by adding a negative value to each side of the equation. \n\n5) You may multiply both sides of the equation by any number except 0. \n\n6) You may divide both sides of the equation by any number except 0. \n\nHint: Since subtracting any number is the same as adding its negative, it can be helpful to replace subtractions with additions of a negative number.

My personal view is because they are not as healthy for people or for the enviornment...the reason why they are not good for the environment is because the best produce to buy is that grown closest to home. Less gas is used and local farmers get the money as opposed to large corporations who are trucking it across the U.S. in refgridgerated trucks. I think there are lots of negative effects that would be hard to go into here but you should try looking up the positive effects of organic and locally grown conventional produce to get you started thinking. Does any of that help?
Picture a right triangle.  Moon's distance is the base, moon's diameter is the height.  Long base, small height.  Angle between base and hypotenuse is 00087 radians.  Height / base is tangent of that angle.  so tan(0.0087) = 3500 / distance.  rewrite as distance = 3500 / tan(0.0087) and solve with calculator.  answer should be in ballpark of 240,000 miles which is 384,000 km.

Scot also came to mean the amount owed for entertainment in a tavern, including drinks. If you got a free drink, you drank ""scot-free""."
"Woodrow Wilson and many Americans blamed the war on militarism, and this was a theme that figured prominently in anti-German propaganda throughout France, Great Britain and, from 1915 onwards, in the United States. The idea was that the Kaiser and his autocratic Prussian government had a thirst for military power and glory, and such goals took priority over the needs and wishes of the people. The implication was that a ""democratic"" government would not have instigated the war.\nAmerica's long-standing policy of isolationism left the United States reluctant to involve itself with what was popularly perceived, among the American public, as a European war.\nEarly in 1917, Germany resumed its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. This, combined with public indignation over the Zimmermann telegram, led to a final break of relations with the Central Powers. After further U-boat attacks on American merchant ships, President Woodrow Wilson requested that Congress declare war on Germany."

Sam Walton also almost always purchased American made goods.  The only time that non-American made goods were purchased is when he couldn't find an American company that made what he was looking for...A lot of people appreciated that...it gave American blue collar workers jobs.  Now days, Wal-mart has put American companies out of business (Pillowtex?) and American blue collar workers out of work.  Presently, Wal-mart is starting to have a huge image problem -- from Immigrant worker scandals, to people not wanting them in their town.  \n\nAlso, Sam Walton never put a store in a huge metropolitan area.  He put them close enough for people to drive to, but not in a metro area.  \n\nInterestingly enough, they are huge in China.  I guess the Chinese will have to learn the hard way, huh?

Well, I read that book last year. It is really good! To summarize this book you have to think back to the story. You could connect it to your life and how it is similiar. You could use an adage or common saying that stands for this book. \nBut mainly, you have to think about the story and write down what you remember. In your own words means that you can't copy down every word from the story.\nGood luck!

Pest-Resistant Crops\nOne of the mainstays of integrated pest management is the use of crop varieties that are resistant or tolerant to insect pests and diseases. A resistant variety may be less preferred by the insect pest, adversely affect its normal development and survival, or the plant may tolerate the damage without an economic loss in yield or quality. Disease-resistant vegetables are widely used, whereas insect-resistant varieties are less common but nonetheless important. Examples include varieties of wheat which have tough stems that prevent development of the Hessian fly and cucurbits (squash, cucumbers, melons) that have lower concentrations of feeding stimulants (cucurbitacins) for cucumber beetles. Commercial corn lines with increased concentration of a chemical called DIMBOA display resistance to European corn borer, a major pest throughout the world. In the case of cabbage, the only reliable method of controlling onion thrips is through the use of resistant varieties.\n\nhttp://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/info/ipmtact.html

The potato blight was caused by Phytophthora infestans.  P. infestans is naturally occurring and typically occurs close to the soil.  When potatoes are grown too close to the surface of the ground, and P. infestans is present, the very outside of the potatoes turn green.  It is common to find potato chips that are green around the outside.  It's caused by the same thing that caused the potato blight!  Although I don't eat green potato chips, they are allegedly not harmful to eat.

If I understand your question correctly - how does one prepare to participate in a counseling interview: You spend the time reviewing the case, where you were in the past sessions and what the next few steps are going to be.\n\nAs a (more or less) unbiased observer you generally have an idea of what the underlying problem may be and have to work on getting the interviewee to that realization, overcoming blocks along the way.  If you don't understand the root cause of the problem yet you spend the time discovering more information and filling in the blanks until you do.\n\nSessions are kept short to keep things adaptable.\n\nI hope this helps.

"Don't buy into the whole idea that you have to have your child attend pre-school. It's just another way for the educational system to get more tax money. You can easily educate your child at home and produce far better results yourself. My mom decided to school me herself before I went to Kinder. I learned to read,write and count and was placed in Advanced Kinder as a result. I was then skipped two grades. It wasn't that I was advanced, it was that my mom took time for me. She wasn't worried about ""finding herself"" or ""climbing the corporate ladder"". She was concerned about my future. I am with the person that said that pre-school is a convenient place to drop off your children while you do more ""important"" things."

This is a really good question.  I'd think that they both come from the same root - they have the same origins.  Before you can stereotype, you need to know someone's identity.  Then you need to apply that identity to other people with the same characteristics.  Keeping in mind that not all stereotypes are negative, this is a nice way to link the two.

"Yes.\nI was teased relentlessly.  I would be just walking alone, trying to avoid people like someone avoids the plague, and kids would go out of thier way to tease me. No one talked to me at all. I was in a graduating class of 13 students so basically it was the cool kids vs. the dork. I had only one ""friend"" and she only talked to me  because the cool kids wouldn't.  She would rat out my secrets just to get back up on the social ladder.\nI got so down that I gained weight and suffered from scoliosis ( Back problems).I could not look at myself in the mirror becasue It would depress me. The very sight of me made me grieve. I was teased because of my looks, something I could not control.\nWhen in the car with my mom  I asked her if she would miss me If I died. I just wanted to know someone cared, and I knew she was working hard at school so we could have a better life. thats when I revealed I wanted to commit suicide. She said it was a ""plan of the devil"" ( we are religious) and told me not to worry,just pray. \nFunny how that was middle school. I was depressed all three years.\nOnce I got to highschool I was SOOO happy. NO one teased me. Everyone was so nice. I had friends, i wasnt popular but I had FRIENDS!\nI felt the stress lift off of me.  I lost weight and the scoliosis went away! \nNow I look back at those days and im sad from time to time, but Im so happy my mom graduated form college and got a great paying job. She was able to send me to a nice private HS and I was treated kindly. I am somewhat happy I didnt kill myself because now I am attending UCONN at storrs and am quite happy. I made it through , but I grieve for the many that werent as lucky as me."

You can set up an online forum on any topic you want easily enough.  You could just declare that the rules are you can only discuss the particular topic, and only in question and answer format.  If you're using it for a particular group (i.e. your class), you could just keep track of points on a whiteboard or such.  It probably won't be quite as addicting as Answers, though, because part of what's so great about Answers is only can discuss whatever topic you're interested in.  If you're trying to get kids interested in something their not, the Q and A format might be more engaging that straight lecture, but they won't find it as much fun as posting silly questions and getting silly answers.

There are several characters that distinguish members of the Order Primates from other mammals, but different members of the Order may or may not display all of these characteristics as they have evolved in different directions throughout their evolutionary history:\n\n1.  opposable thumb and big toe (opposable thumb is best developed in humans.  thumb is completely lost in spider monkeys)\n\n2.  flat nails instead of claws  (marmosets have re-developed claws to assist in climbing)\n\n3.  hindlimb-dominated locomotion (best developed in humans and sifakas, forelimbs have become dominant in gibbons)\n\n4.  relative reduction in the olfactory sensory system as compared to other mammalian orders (very noticeable in South American primates, snouts have become enlarged again in the baboons, are still well developed in many lemur species)\n\n5.  increased reliance on visual sensation (primates in general probably have the best vision and best colour sensation of any group of mammals)\n\n6.  tendency towards smaller litter size, longer gestation times and extended juvenile growth with accompanied increase in material care (most developed in humans with 18+ years of parental care and litter sizes of even two being unusual)\n\n7.  relatively large brains (again, most developed in humans)\n\n8.  reduced number of teeth, with a maximum of two incisors, one canine, three premolars and three molars in each jaw quadrant (humans have further reduced this to two premolars, and the third molars (aka wisdom teeth) often do not develop at all)\n\nSo there is no one trait that automatically designates a mammal as being a primate.

I think if you were to take a good look at what slavery is it will sort of give you an insight as to why they were in fear. Slaves were held against their will and often beaten badly.  I think if you can realize the pressure of being held against your will you will understand it better.  If I were to hold you against your will/desire do you think I would have to be afraid of what you might do to me? Especially if you hated what I was doing to you and your family.  The planters were always afraid of the slaves killing them in their attempt to gain freedom.  They did not like the slavemasters very well.

By bilingual education, I am going to assume that you mean teaching children in their native language and the language of a country they have immigrated to.\n\n1) The children aren't pushed to immerse themselves in the new language they need to learn, instead being taught that a mix of their native language and the new language \n2) It is far easier for teachers to lapse back into the children's native language when they get tired of trying to explain a concept in the new language thus defeating the goal of teaching them the new language.

I'm not a teen (23), but I was 16 when I had my first son. I now have two sons aged 6yrs and 6months.\n\nI would have to say that getting pregnant at an early age is not the best idea to do. You need very good support from your family and you need a partner that will be there for you no matter what, and because they are hard to find I wouldn't recommend it. \n\nYou may think at that time that you and him are going to be together for ever (I thought the same thing) but him and I are no longer together. True love is hard to find and you have to think about finance and support from family members no matter the age you are when you get pregnant.
"The two major forms of diabetes are type 1, previously called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile-onset diabetes, and type 2, previously called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity-onset diabetes.\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a group of diseases that share a common characteristic: high levels of blood glucose. Diabetes happens when the body cannot produce enough insulin or when the insulin that is produced in the pancreas cannot work adequately. When diabetes is not well controlled, it can Insulin is a hormone secreted by your pancreas and its function is to regulate blood glucose levels. \n\nInsulin works like a key to open the door of the cells so \nglucose – the fuel you get from food - can come inside and be converted into energy.cause serious complications and premature death.\n\nThink of a corridor full of doors. You need a key to unlock each door so you can put glucose in each room, Well, insulin is that key and if it is not produced in the right amounts or if it cannot open the doors because it is cracked, then\nglucose builds up in the blood causing your blood sugar to go up. This is called hyperglycemia (high levels of blood glucose) and is the common manifestation of diabetes.\n\nThe symptoms are:\n Frequent urination\n Excessive thirst\n Excessive hunger\n Feeling tired or ill\n Sudden weight loss\n Blurred vision\n Slow healing of infections\n\nType 1 Diabetes\n\nIn type 1 diabetes, the disease process is more severe than with type 2, and onset is usually in childhood:\n\n    * Beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin are gradually destroyed. Eventually insulin deficiency is absolute.\n    * Without insulin to move glucose into cells, blood glucose levels become excessively high, a condition known as hyperglycemia.\n    * Because the body cannot utilize the sugar, it spills over into the urine and is lost.\n    * Weakness, weight loss, and excessive hunger and thirst are among the consequences of this ""starvation in the midst of plenty.""\n    * Patients become dependent on administered insulin for survival.\n\n\nType 2 Diabetes\n\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for 90% of cases. An estimated 16 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, and half are unaware they have it. The disease mechanisms in type 2 diabetes are not\nwholly known, but some experts suggest that it may involve the following three stages in most patients:\n\n    * The first stage in type 2 diabetes is the condition called insulin resistance. Although insulin can attach normally to receptors on liver and muscle cells, certain mechanisms prevent insulin from moving glucose (blood sugar) into these cells where it can be used. Most type 2 diabetics produce variable, even normal or high, amounts of insulin, and in the beginning this amount is usually sufficient to overcome such resistance.\n    * Over time, the pancreas becomes unable to produce enough insulin to overcome resistance. In type 2 diabetes the initial effect of this stage is usually an abnormal rise in blood sugar right after a meal (called postprandial\nhyperglycemia). This effect is now believed to be particularly damaging to the body.\n    * Eventually, the cycle of elevated glucose further impairs and possibly destroys beta cells, thereby stopping insulin production completely and causing full-blown diabetes. This is made evident by fasting hyperglycemia, in \nwhich elevated glucose levels are present most of the time.\n\nMaturity-Onset Diabetes in Youth. Maturity-onset diabetes in youth (MODY) is a rare genetic form of type 2 diabetes that develops only in Caucasian teenagers. It accounts for 2% to 5% of type 2 cases.\n\nGestational Diabetes. An estimated 5% of pregnant women develop a form of type 2 diabetes, in their third trimester called gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is usually temporary."

"The 1929 stock market crash is conventionally said to have occurred on Thursday the 24th and Tuesday the 29th of October. These two dates have been dubbed ""Black Thursday"" and ""Black Tuesday,"" respectively. On September 3, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 381.2. At the end of the market day on Thursday, October 24, the market was at 299.5 — a 21 percent decline from the high. On this day the market fell 33 points — a drop of 9 percent — on trading that was approximately three times the normal daily volume for the first nine months of the year. By all accounts, there was a selling panic. By November 13, 1929, the market had fallen to 199. By the time the crash was completed in 1932, following an unprecedentedly large economic depression, stocks had lost nearly 90 percent of their value. \n\nThe events of Black Thursday are normally defined to be the start of the stock market crash of 1929-1932, but the series of events leading to the crash started before that date. This article examines the causes of the 1929 stock market crash. While no consensus exists about its precise causes, the article will critique some arguments and support a preferred set of conclusions. It argues that one of the primary causes was the attempt by important people and the media to stop market speculators. A second probable cause was the great expansion of investment trusts, public utility holding companies, and the amount of margin buying, all of which fueled the purchase of public utility stocks, and drove up their prices. Public utilities, utility holding companies, and investment trusts were all highly levered using large amounts of debt and preferred stock. These factors seem to have set the stage for the triggering event. This sector was vulnerable to the arrival of bad news regarding utility regulation. In October 1929, the bad news arrived and utility stocks fell dramatically. After the utilities decreased in price, margin buyers had to sell and there was then panic selling of all stocks."
Glucose is the material that energy is made out of (carb-wise).  Glucose (carbs), tri-glycerides (fats), and amino acids (proteins) all give you energy, and all three of them go through different processes to be turned into Acetyl CoA which then goes through the Krebs Cycle to be turned into Carbon Dioxide, and Hydrogen.  You breathe out the Carbon Dioxide, and the Hydrogen gets shipped (by means of Riboflavin and Niacin) to the Electron Transport Chain.  This handy dandy process leads to the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which IS the direct source of cellular energy.  The cell breaks one phosphate group off the ATP and the energy released from that bond is the energy that runs the body.  Because glucose goes through all those processes, it isn't technically the direct source of energy for the cell.

"Gnome\nA Gnome is a mythical creature characterized by its small stature and subterranean lifestyle. According to Paracelsus, gnomes are the most important of the elemental spirits of the classical element earth, and they move as easily through the earth as humans walk upon it. The sun's rays turn them into stone. In other traditions, they are simply small, mischievous sprites or goblins. Some sources claim they spend the daytime as toads instead of in stone.\n\nOften featured in Germanic fairy tales, including those by the Brothers Grimm, the gnome often resembles a gnarled old man living deep underground and guards buried treasure. Because of this, Swiss bankers are sometimes disparagingly referred to as the Gnomes of Zürich. Gnomes feature in the legends of many of central, northern and eastern European lands by other names: a kaukis is a Prussian gnome, and barbegazi are gnome-like creatures with big feet in the traditions of France and Switzerland. In Iceland, gnomes (vættir) are so respected that roads are re-routed around areas said to be inhabited by them. Further east, tengu are sometimes referred to as winged gnomes.\n\nIndividual gnomes are not very often detailed or featured as characters in stories, but in Germanic folklore, Rübezahl, lord over the underworld, was sometimes referred to as a mountain gnome. According to some traditions, the gnome king is called Gob.\n\nRudolf Steiner, and other theosophists before him, lectured at length on gnomes, and especially their supportive role in the development of plant life (and biodynamic agriculture). Rupert Sheldrake has written a good deal about morphogenic fields, an idea Terry Pratchett used in his Discworld books many times.\n\nThe word gnome is said to derive from the New Latin gnomus and ultimately from the Greek gnosis, meaning knowledge. According to myth, gnomes hoarded secret knowledge just as they hoarded treasure.\n\nGarden gnomes\n\nThe first garden gnomes were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1847 by Sir Charles Isham, when he brought 21 terracotta figures back from a trip to Germany and placed them as ornaments in the gardens of his home, Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Only one of the original batch of gnomes survives: Lampy as he is known, is on display at Lamport Hall, and is insured for one million pounds.\n\nGarden gnomes have become a popular accessory in many gardens, although they are not loved by all. They are often the target of pranks: people have been known to return garden gnomes ""to the wild"", most notably France's ""Front de Liberation des Nains de Jardins"" and Italy's ""MALAG"" (Garden Gnome Liberation Front). Some kidnapped garden gnomes have been sent on trips around the world (the travelling gnome prank).\n\nA sub-culture exists among those who collect garden gnomes, which is frequently lampooned in popular culture.\n\nGarden gnomes were made in various poses and pursuing various pastimes, such as fishing or gardening. More recently, garden gnomes have been depicted indulging in indecent exposure or having sex.\n\n\n\nGnomic Culture\n\n    * The Nome King (spelled without the silent ""G"") and his nome subjects nearly transformed Dorothy Gale and her friends into bric-a-brac in Ozma of Oz, the third book in L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz series. The character appeared several times in later books in the series.\n\n    * J. R. R. Tolkien used the word gnome in his early work The Book of Lost Tales for a fictional people later called Ñoldor. He dropped the term in his published works, since he found the gnomes of folklore to be so unlike his High Elves as to confuse his readers. ""Gnomes"" also refer to the Valar.\n\n    * Gnomes are one of several races on Terry Pratchett's Discworld, where they are also called goblins. The Nac Mac Feegle are sometimes considered an ethnic subgroup of gnomes.\n\n    * Nomes (again without a ""G"") are a race of t"

"http://www.yamoslair.com/reaper.html\nhttp://www.ghostnet7.org/grimreaper.html\nDeath to many is something to fear because its the great unknown, it comes with a sinister stigma or image, many cultures and religions all over the world have ways of coping with the one thing all men and women will one day have to stand face to face with, the greatest of unknowns ""Death"". \n\nThe fact is that we are ALL going to have to take the plunge of death. Through out time human kind has delved into the deepest and darkest places in there minds and imaginations to try and find an answer to death, or to give it a face and to better understand that dark and frightening thing that we all put to the back of our minds, but know that one day we will all have to take the plunge into that dark unknown. \n\nTo many death is a dark and sinister and unforgiving and unrelenting shadow, so you can probably see how the modern idea and image of what the grim reaper or death looks like comes from, its a dark figure holding a scythe, dressed in a black hooded robe, with a skull for a head. How did this image come about, and is there really a ghostly figure called death ready to introduce him self to us when our flame has eventually been extinguished ? \n\nThe image of death or of The Grim Reaper probably comes from human kinds fear of dyeing, many people want to live forever and the fact that they know they cant live forever has caused them to give a face to that nasty obstacle that stops them from being able to stay alive for good, so of course the picture that is going to be painted by a death fearing society is going to be that of a scary and mysterious one. \n\nThe reaper is seen to be carrying a scythe, the idea of this comes from the idea that when death comes to us he’s coming to chop down the living and to sever the soul from the body. The scythe is used for chopping down crops so the image of the grim reaper and his scythe would indicate that its seen as death coming and ""reaping his harvest"" his crops being the souls of the just departed. \n\nThe Reaper is not just seen as a figure to meet at ones own death, but its also seen as a warning to the living, that if they dont change there ways then ""death"" is just around the corner, so he can be seen in a positive light too. \n\nMany people who claimed to have been visited by The Reaper say that he was totally silent and did nothing except pull out an old watch on a chain or an hour glass and is said to gently tap on it like the seconds ticking away all the while not saying a word, but even though he says nothing the message is clear to the person seeing it. His skull like face probably comes from the skull symbolising death myth, so it would make sense that people would see the reapers face as a skull. \n\nMany people might see The Reaper as the sinister man in a black robe because that is how they view death, so the reaper will probably show him self to each person how that person views death personally, if someone longed for death or did not look at death as something to fear I can imagine then death would probably show them selves to them people as something more pleasant looking. Death is what we want him (or it) to be. \n\nThe image of the grim reaper in a long robe comes from the garb of Death or the black mourning robe first seen in the 1500s, in them times a monk would stand over the dyeing persons bed, so again the images of things people have seen surrounding death have been associated with how people view The Grim Reaper, which is why he looks a little like a monk dressed in a abbot. \n\nThe belief in The Grim Reaper probably goes back to ancient times. In Greek mythology you have the god Chronos or Cronus also know as ""Father time"" who could also be seen carrying a scythe and his saying was ""nothing lasts forever - except time(death)"". The word ‘corone’ to the Greeks (translated to English) means crow, so its no wonder that the crow i"

Well, having debt is how you get a credit rating in the first place.  So just the fact that someone has some - and will continue to do so, doesn't mean it has to be bad.

I guess working towards an MBA ultimately is one thing thats pretty common. Which means you do a regular BCA or BBM, and then jump into MBA. I'm not from the commerce stream, so I'm not really to sure about the exact courses.

It depends on your field and the caliber of school you're interested in. Medical school and law school are very intense from start to finish, whereas non-professional PhD or EdD programs are not as hard on your hair color (and/or hairline for males). But highly ranked programs will be very competitive and cut-throat in any field.\n \nI'm working towards my PhD in Economics in a second-tier program. I love graduate school for lots of reasons. For one, my classmates are amped up about learning and researching. As an undergrad, I was in a small minority because I liked school. Also, my graduate education will earn me a starting salary 100% higher than what I would have got straight out of undergrad. I get a full tuition waiver and a living stipend in exchange for some mild work, so I won't have to go into debt to get this degree.\n\nThe list of disadvantages could be pretty long, too. My friends that got jobs after undergrad are making grownup money, living in grownup houses, getting married, starting families, etc. I won't be able to do that for four years (although some grad students start families while they're still in school). Also, I hear that dissertation advisors can be real pains in the a**. \n\nAll in all, grad school is right for me. It's up to you to decide if it's right for you, and getting input from other veterans is a good start.
Christains usually present the baby to God on the altar. The pastor anoints the baby with oil as a way to say that the child has been consecrated to God. Then the pastor asks God to give the parents wisdom to take care of the baby accordingly the God's will. There is no baptism...just a special prayer from the whole Church...
cuz they think theres nothing else to solve the problem.  cant wait til bush gets outta their.  hes ruined this country along with other countries.
why can't you apply for both? You need to go to both departments and check out there facilities and what the people are like. Also, see what you can find out about what research is coming out of each of them. The more they're producing and getting pulished in better journals, the better. Its not just about the city, its about the quality of the research you'll be doing.
Well, the base pairs have to match up to each other according to their model, so for every G there would be a C and for every T there would be an A, so that seems logically right on its face. Check Wikipedia.
Northern Arizona University is in Flagstaff; University of Arizona is in Tucson.  The only thing I know about Tucson is that it is hot, hot, hot.  Flagstaff is actually a very nice town, if you can afford it.  I've been to the campus of Northern Arizona U., and it is a pleasant place.  I know nothing of the academic programs of U. Arizona, but I saw the catalog of Northern Az. U., and it looked pretty interesting to me.  I'd vote for NAU.  (And don't forget the Lowell Observatory is in Flagstaff; fascinating!)

"The Intolerable Acts, called by the British the Coercive Acts or Punitive Acts, were a series of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 in response to the growing unrest in thirteen American colonies, particularly in Boston, Massachusetts after incidents such as the Boston Tea Party. Enforcement of the Acts played a major role in the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War and the establishment of the First Continental Congress.\nThis British cartoon, depicting the acts as asaults upon an anthropomorphic Boston, was quickly copied and distributed by Paul Revere to all the colonies. \n\nThe Coercive Acts included:\n\n    * Massachusetts Government Act\n    * Administration of Justice Act\n    * Boston Port Act\n    * Quartering Act\n\nThe Quebec Act was also passed in 1774, but it was a piece of legislation unrelated to the Coercive Acts. American Whigs, however, were alarmed by the Quebec Act as much as the Coercive Acts, and they labeled it one of the ""Intolerable Acts"". Their main complaints over the Quebec Act were the protections granted to the Indian territories and to the Catholic settlers in Ohio. These were viewed as attempts to halt expansion into the west and to strengthen a church that many opposed.\n\nThe acts had several different effects. They unintentionally promoted sympathy for the revolutionaries in Massachusetts, and encouraged revolutionaries from the otherwise diverse colonies to band together. However, the Quebec Act had the opposite effect among French Catholics in the Province of Quebec, encouraging many of them to either pragmatic inaction or support for the Crown."

Merchant guilds controlled the trade in the town by setting prices, et cetera.\n\nCraft guilds regulated the quality, working hours, and conditions of its members.  There were 3 levels of guild members:  Masters, journeymen, and apprentices.\n\nApprentices worked for approx. 7 yrs to learn the craft, then became journeymen.  the journeymen worked approx. 7 years, then submitted a sample to the guild masters for approval. If the item was approved, they became Masters.

Testicular cancer is a rare disease in men caused by abnormal growth of cells of the testicle. The testicles (or testes) are located inside the scrotum, the loose bag of skin that hangs below the penis. Each testicle (or testis) produces sperm.\n\n\nThe male pelvis\n\nCancer\nThe building blocks of the body are tiny cells, which normally repair and reproduce in a controlled process. With cancer, this process goes wrong and cells can divide and grow in an uncontrolled way, causing a lump on or within the part of the body affected. If this tumour contains cells that are able to invade neighbouring tissues or organs, it is known as malignant. If the tumour does not do this, it is termed benign.

I've taken the Praxis II (and many others as I've moved several times and each state has different requirements).  The Praxis II is not the hardest one, but it wasn't the easiest.  It helped that I had taught in other places for 6 years prior to the test.  My suggestion -- read the test booklet carefully.  Consider purchasing a test prep book, but also reading from professional development materials will help with the test.  \n\n(Yes, I have a teaching degree.)

You would have to contact the State Health Department. They should be able to direct you to the National State Nurse Registry. You can give your information by phone and they will also have you probably send in some documents for proof. Look up on the website of your state, then go to department of human services. Look up licenses and certifications, it should be there. Good Luck.......Nurses are always needed....
I think you've got a word wrong in their somewhere, or else it's just creepy.  The part about a females husband's wife does bring you back to the original female, but it's the fiance part that throws it off.  You can't have a fiance that has a husband or wife because a person can't be a fiance and a spouse at the same time, unless you are engaged to be married to someone who is already married and you are both going to be married or your fiance is going to be getting a divorce from their spouse.  Seriously, the answer is YOU, but it's kind of screwed up unless you messed something up because it involves the starting person having a fiance who has a spouse already.
I think so but I think you should try your hardest and go for a higher GPA.

no.  a number to a negative power becomes one over that number.  for example 2 to the -2 power becomes one over four.  first you square two then put it in the denominator as a positive.  any number you plug in for x will still yield a value of y greater than 0.
You should VASTLY limit the amount of time your 2 year old watches television - only 30 minutes to 1 hour per day.  By the time your child is a bit older - say around 10 - you can increase that time to about 2 hours.\n\nAny TV takes away from time the child could be exploring and learning on his/her own or learning from you.  Instead of turning on the TV, bond and teach your child yourself.  The time spent will be well worth it!

Actually, the Medieval Era is usually referred to as the Dark Ages. Because of the stranglehold that supersition had on people. Anything connecting with science and the arts was considered evil, in fact a person would be killed if he/she defied the held order of the day. When people actually managed to break free of this, was the era that is called the Renaissance, which referred to the rebirth of knowledge.
It is a little known fact that Australia was just as involved with the Vietnam was as the U.S.  Their involvement almost exactly parallels U.S. involvement because they were a part of a coalition of countries who stepped up to try to stop the spread of communism in that region of the world. Australia sent several brigades of service men to fight, or rather contain, communism in Vietnam. Australia probably had very good reason to do so. \n\nIf communism spread through Southeast Asia, it would leave Australia in a very vulnerable economic, military and political position because of the distance from any ally or friendly country. A worse case scenario would entail one or several Southeast Asian countries joining forces and invading Australia. Just the Vietnamese could have overwhelmed Australia’s armed forces because Australia's military was very small and not well equipped at that time. \n\nLike in the U.S., the Vietnam War became very unpopular in Australia. They had lost many servicemen in a conflict that seemed like it could continue forever. Furthermore, there had been other countries near Australia that successfully pushed back communism because of the fighting in Vietnam, which gave the impression that the original reason for Australia to be involved had been accomplished and there was no further need for Australia to be there. There had been major protests and anti-war movements paralleling the timeline of similar issues in the U.S. \n\nThe big difference between Australia and U.S. involvement is how the Vietnamese communist government reacted to the two countries after the war ended. There was a lot of hatred of America by the communists, but hardly a mention about Australia. In fact, Australian news reporters were on the ground in Saigon when the NVA forces took over the city and ended the war. They were allowed to leave without issue. \n\nThat in mind, Australia was able to rebuild a relationship with Vietnam much quicker than the U.S. Commerce and trade between the two countries have been very strong for many years, with tourism from Australia to Vietnam being one of the major industries between the countries. \n\nAustralia has become a favorite country for Vietnamese immigration because of being much easier than immigrating to the U.S. There is a large population of Vietnamese and other Southeast Asians now living in Australia. \n\nMy information comes from years of studying Vietnam, and I don't recall exactly where I found this information. I suggest you Goggle it and find more information for yourself. I've given you enough information to have a good head start.\n\nGood luck!
If the offender is still on probation, they would need permission from a judge. \n\nIf the offender is off supervision, then yes, he has the right to be around children. \n\nI wish you were more specific with your question though.

"The term Jim Crow comes from the minstrel show song ""Jump Jim Crow"" written in 1828 and performed by Thomas Dartmouth ""Daddy"" Rice, a white English migrant to the U.S. and the first popularizer of blackface performance. The song and blackface itself were an immediate hit. A caricature of a shabbily dressed rural black, ""Jim Crow"" became a standard character in minstrel shows. He was often paired with ""Zip Coon,"" a flamboyantly dressed urban black who associated more with white culture. By 1837, Jim Crow was being used to refer to racial segregation."

What is it you need help with? You have to be more precise in what you are asking.
Since the founding of religion, the gods have sought to test those with power. Jocasta was sent by Apollo to do just that: to test Oedipus' faith and conviction. \n\nThroughout the play, Jocasta tested the beliefs of those around her by feigning disbelief in the gods herself. Though she put up this false front, she did keep her faith. At the beginning of the scene wherein a messenger relayed word of Polybus' death and Oedipus' ascension to the throne of Corinth, we see Jocasta praying - not the act of a disbeliever at all! Again, in the same Episode, Jocasta carries garlands and incense to the altar and tries to appeal to Apollo to purify the city of Thebes. \n\nWhile her faith remains strong, her task from the gods is to test the faiths of others, especially that of Oedipus, which she does. After accusing Creon of conspiracy and treason, Oedipus relates to Jocasta the details of his meeting with Tiresius. Jocasta proceeds to plant doubts of the gods by telling Oedipus the story of the Delphian Oracle and the circumstances surrounding Laius' death. Again, after Polybus' death, she excitedly tells Oedipus that his prophecy was obviously untrue, though it wasn't, and by doing so she attempts to hint that the oracles - and thus the gods - are false. By planting this doubt in Oedipus' mind, the gods are able to test his faith, and his ruling power, through Jocasta - a test which he fails until it is too late. \n\nWhy, then, would Jocasta be forced to perform such a dubious task for the gods? It is because she tried to avoid an earlier prophecy. By tying her child's feet together and casting him out, she attempted to defeat the gods, and this of course angered them. Her punishment, then, was to test the beliefs of the very child she cast out. \n\nOedipus Rex was Sophocles' attempt to show the Greeks that they could not avoid the dealings of the gods, or they may be forced to conspire against the very people they should love most. Jocasta was, in this way, a victim. Though it was by her own doing that this penalty was cast upon her, it was not something she was happy to do, which becomes apparent when she realizes the truth in her earlier prophecy. It is at this moment that she becomes aware of her punishment, and in desperation kills herself. Oedipus Rex is a true tragedy in the sense that fate and Oedipus' own tragic flaw (his hotheadedness) combine to bring about his downfall. What makes it that much more tragic, however, is that the events were, for the most part, out of Oedipus' control. The chain of events was set in motion by his own mother. He was forced to leave Corinth (thus trying to avoid his own prophecy), afraid he may bring harm to the persons whom he loved the most. Scared and angry at the curse he carried upon his back, who can blame him for being hot tempered? It is Jocasta, his own mother and wife, that brings the story full circle by again cursing him, perpetuating a disbelief in the gods. \n\nJocasta is a victim in Oedipus Rex, but not as much as she is a catalyst for Oedipus' own victimization. She keeps her faith throughout and tries to relieve Oedipus of his. Because of this, readers may in turn pity her and loathe her. But the gods tested the king of Thebes through her - the main goal of the play - and both he and she failed. \n\nShe is purely a victim.  She was sent to do a job and like previous paragraphs. Failed.  Her faith was in the Gods.  If she had more in herself then she would have saved her children.  They relied more on their faith in the Gods then in themselves.  I would think now that if someone did this they would be crazy.  Why give up your flesh and blood for a higher power.  I couldn't, could you?\nI didn't understand your last question in your paragraph. Care to elaberate?

Get a slump cone, scoop and tamping rod from a concrete accessories supplier. As the concrete is being discharged from the truck scoop some concrete into your cone which is clean and held down on a flat level surface. Fill it up to a third full then give it 25 tamps with the rod. Top it up to two thirds full then give it another 25 tamps, then fill it right up to the top and give it another 25 tamps. Level off the top then slowly lift the cone off, allowing the concrete to slump down beneath it. Set the cone upside down beside the concrete, place the rod on top of the cone and across the top of the concrete and measure down from the rod to the top of the concrete. This measurement is the slump value of the concrete. Make sure you wear gloves when handling concrete. Don't use a bucket to move the concrete from the truck to the cone and don't twist the cone as you lift it off the concrete as a lot of people do. There you go! Good luck

"What's the origin of the phrase ""spitting image""? \n\nSpitting Image is an expression that lacks a clear consensus as to its origin. The Morris' (Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins) cite one authority who thinks that spit in this context comes from the Anglo-Saxon spittan, meaning ""to eject from the mouth,"" and that the phrase means 'speaking likeness'. He quotes a source dating back to 1602 to support this notion. Harold Wentworth in the American Dialect Dictionary take a different view. He has documented a common phrase in the Southern United States, ""He's the very spit of his father ,"" and suggested that 'spit' is probably derived from 'spirit'. His reasoning is the tendency of Southern dialect to soften or lose the letter 'r'. Thus, spitting image would have originated as the spirit and image."
Percentile is supposed to mean the percent of all the people who took the test that you scored HIGHER than.  Since you can't score higher that yourself your percentile shouldn't be 100.  It's usually referred to as 99.9. This assumes that it was impossible to score more than 100% (no bonus questions), and that 100% meant your child got all the questions right.

"Medicine in the Middle Ages was really scary by our standards. People blamed disease and sickness on everything from ghosts to an angry God. Along about the 14th century, everything was changing. Superstitions ran amuck, but exploration and enlightenment was creeping into society. Dissections and the study of anatomy were popular with whole universities devoted to this science. Still, no one knew what caused illnesses and diseases like small pox destroyed thousands. Diseases were treated with herbs, prayers and rituals (including bloodletting). Sanitation wasn't practiced, so as you can imagine ""disease demons"" ran amuck.\n\n\nHere's a couple of good sites for you:\nhttp://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medicine_in_the_middle_ages.htm\nhttp://www.learner.org/exhibits/middleages/health.html\n\n\nGood luck with your studies,\n~Tia~"

Joining the Air Force was the best thing that I ever did with my life. I was 20 years old, failing college, living with my parents, hardly making any money, and watching all of my friends do things with their lives..so I finally decided to do something with mine.  My family comes from a big military background as well and it was an easy decision for what branch to go into such as the Air Force. The military in general is not for everyone. Its a big lifestyle change that you will need to become assumed to.  You're parents are naturally scared because they love you and don't want you to get hurt, which the chances of that happening with you in the Air Force depending on what career field you get, are slim to none.  The Air Force is a GREAT way to meet to friends that you'll keep for life, get an education, see the world, make an honest paycheck, and be a part of an organization that you can feel proud to be in. Looks great on a resume if you decide to get out in four years as well.  You're YOUNG and time is on your side, I know four years sounds like a really long time but it goes by SO fast. I wish you the best of luck in whatever you choose to do.
Born into slavery in 1834, the woman who would become known to millions as Aunt Jemima was really named Nancy Green. She was a warm, friendly woman who also happened to be an excellent cook (though, interestingly enough, the famous Aunt Jemima pancake recipe wasn't hers. It belonged to a company called the Pearl Milling Company). And it was in 1893 that she was discovered in Chicago, at the age of 59, by one R.T. Davis.

well cloning in simple terms in duplicating the DNA of something.  Sheep have been successfully cloned.  The idea of cloning is actually quite simple.  Its the actual process that is difficult.\nwhen cloning something...lets say u want to clone yourself...u need an unfertilized egg cell (human egg cell in this case) and a DNA sample of the source (you).  First the nucleus of the egg cell needs to be removed.  Another nucleus containing your DNA is put into the egg cell.  Some kind of chemical is then added which triggers the fertilizatoin process.  The egg will begin to divide until it becomes stem cells.  If left alone they will become a fetus which will grow into a human infant--your clone.\n\nOn another note...the stem cells could be taken, and with more research, could be turned into any organ of the body that will match the donor of the DNA perfectlly.  What does this mean?  If your diabetic and need insulin shots everyday...u could use stem cells to grow a new pancreas and theoretically cure diabetes.  Virtually all diseases could be cured with stem cells, but a moral issue comes up about when life starts and u need to kill other cells to get the stem cells...so current legislation restricts stem cell research in America

"Purpose of Ethics in Society\nWhen we have a question like this, we should make sure we understand what we mean by ethics.\nWebster's Dictionary states:\n\n"" 1.a. A set of principles of right conduct. \nb. A theory or a system of moral values. \n\n2. ethics. (used with a sing. verb). The study of the general nature of morals and of the specific moral choices to be made by a person; moral philosophy. \n\n3. ethics. (used with a sing. or pl. verb). The rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or the members of a profession.""\n\nWe have ""right conduct"" and ""moral values"" as key words, which of course can differ from society to society.\n\nE.g., in the US it is custom to keep the left hand under the table while eating with the right hand. This makes more room for the neighbor at a crowded table. In Germany, it is custom to keep both hands on the table while eating (I wonder if they wanted to hinder ""fooling around under the table."") There are many more differences in ethics in different societies. What ethics are valued, is an agreement, born out of tradition and practicality.\n\nThe principles of ethics, which everyone is expected to follow, promises good results, e.g. when followed in the Western society, e.g.:\n* one can trust the others (they don't lie or betray);\n* one can go out at night without fearing for one's property or life;\n* one can trust one's neighbors to take care of one's house in one's absence, and can trust one's spouse to be good when at work;\n* one can rely on promises or contracts and not be disappointed;\n* one can trust one's elected politicians and judges not to be prejudiced or bribed;\n* one can trust that no toxins are placed into products and that the air, the soil and the water are kept clean.\n* one can trust that no being has to fear for its life.\n\nIdeally, if everyone would follow the given set of ethics, it would be an easy and relaxing life and many services would not be needed, like ID theft insurance, police or security guards, security lock services or ID cards.\n\nIn the West, ethics are also given by the 10 commandments. The world would be a different place, if everybody would follow these: no stealing, no lying, no jealousy, no fighting over religion. \n\nHowever, we, the humans, are not there yet, to follow the ethics we set before ourselves. Nevertheless, they help to keep society safer and make life easier.\n\nIn an ideal society there would be no law regulations, for everyone would behave as expected. When something in society is talked about a lot, there is a problem. E.g. if people would not use their personal toothbrushes, there would be frequent reports in the papers about the importance of a personal toothbrush. If most use their own toothbrush, there would be no or little talk about it.\n\nFurthermore, if we would talk and print more about the good events along our ethical lines, we would help create the good, for thought is a creative power. Fear also creates - that what is feared. Therefore, it is really doing harm when one makes others fearful. Prevention is different from making fearful, prevention gives constructive and harmless solutions.\n\nThere could be a future society with ethics allowing only positive thoughts! What a world this would be: no stealing, harming, killing, betraying, slandering, bribing, secret actions, bombs, wars or disease?\n\nA world of honored ethics is not impossible, it seems. It's the decision we, every person, can make, rewarding the good.\nCordially, India.Magica"
Fortunately, there is a simple formula for finding the sum of an Arithmetic Series. \n\nIn general, the sum of an Arithmetic Series can be written as follows: \n\nS = i + (i+d) + (i+2d) + (i+3d) + ... +[i+(n-1)d]\n\nand can be simplified as: \n\nS = (n / 2) * [2i + (n-1) * d] \n\nwhere\ni is the initial term,\nd is the difference between successive terms and\nn is the number of terms in the series.
"The earliest bicycle was a wooden scooter-like contraption called a celerifere; it was invented about 1790 by Comte Mede de Sivrac of France. In 1816, Baron Karl von Drais de Sauerbrun, of Germany, invented a model with a steering bar attached to the front wheel, which he called a Draisienne. It has two wheels (of the same size), and the rider sat between the two wheels, but there were no pedals; to move, you had to propel the bicycle forward using your feet (a bit like a scooter). He exhibited his bicycle in Paris on April 6, 1818. \n\n     Kirkpatrick MacMillan (1812-1878), a blacksmith from Dumfriesshire, Scotland, invented the first bicycle with foot pedals in the 1830 to 1840's, but he never patented it and his idea did not catch on locally. \n\n    A French father-and-son team of carriage-makers, Pierre and Ernest Michaux, invented an improved bicycle in the 1860's. Many early bicycles (called velocipedes, meaning ""fast foot,"" or, more descriptively, ""bone shakers"") had huge front wheels - it was thought that the bigger the wheel, the faster you could go. Early tires were wooden - metal tires were an improvement, and solid rubber tires were added later. A chain with sprockets was added to the bicycle in the 1880's; this was called the ""safety bicycle."" Air-filled tires were also added in the 1880's. The derailleur gear system was added in the 1970's."
A free enterprise economy is where the market forces of supply and demand determine the price of goods and services. So, if you wanted 10 pineapples and fifty other people wanted them as well, and there were 10 pineapples then the pineapples would go to the person who is willing to pay the most for them. But let's say that there are two people and you only want one pineapple and there were fifty on the market, then the pineapple's price would be determined by who was offering the pineapple for sale for the least amount of money.

The first place to start is by filling out the Federal Application for Student Aid.  This form is sent to the school you are attending and you are then considered for institutional aid as well as government aid.  If you indicate your interest on the form, you will be considered for Pell Grants, Federal Work Study, Stafford Student Loans as well as scholarships.  How much money you receive will depend on how much money you make and how old you are.  For instance if you are 19 years old, unemployed but your parents are rich doctors, you will not be offered grants (free money) but you will be offered parent loans (loans mom and dad have to pay back).  22 is the magic age where your parents income is no longer a part of your FAFSA, unless you qualify for one of the special circumstances such as you are a ward of the state (orphan), you were adopted or you are no longer a legal dependent of your parents (not tax dependent, legal dependent). If you are a parent or have dependents that will help your chances of getting grants.  You have to apply for a PIN first, then you can submit your information to the FAFSA folks.  Check out http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ and your school's financial aid site for more information.  Merit based (GPA, volunteer work, etc) scholarships are awarded by the school and not the government.
Do some fun group activities. My favorite: On a piece of paper (don't show it do anyone yet) the teacher draws random shapes, lines, squiggles. Each student grabs a partner, and one partner goes to look at your paper. The artist partners then copy down your drawing. Each artist must explain to their partner with words but no gestures how to draw the picture without showing it to them.\n\nThis strengthens the ability to give and follow directions.

I agree with other posters on America being the perfect and current example of this right now.  We believe that democracy is the only right way and Iraqis are crazy for not wanting it.  We've gone so far as to lable anyone who doesn't want it as terrorist or insurgants just because they don't want our form of government.  Thats not terrorism yes the American government and public is so 'ethnocentric'/'egocentric' that anyone who rejects it must be crazy.\n\nAlso, the rest of the world doesn't care nearly as much about the whole Iraqi, Osama Bin Laden, 9/11 deal as we like to think they do.  It was a big deal for us, but in many countries its just another day to them.
"Hmmm. I read over alot of the other answers and none of them describe me, so Im gonna explain why I do drugs (Im 17). \n\nI'll start by saying that I dont do stupid drugs like crack or meth, that destroy your body and leave you hooked. The drugs I use are pot, acid, magic mushrooms, occasionally opium, salvia divinorum, and i smoke cigarettes.\n\nI use drugs not because I think its ""cool"" or because I was pressured into doing any. I use drugs for meditation and mind expansion for the most part. Someone who has never tried acid or shrooms wont really understand when I tell them how amazing mind expansion is. Pot I use for meditation mostly, it takes concentration, but I've gotten good at it. As a result of my experiences with drugs and meditation I've reached a level of inner peace and happiness that I'd never before thought possible. I'm not saying you cant do this without drugs, but it makes it somewhat easier. And I dont need to be high all the time either to feel that effect. \n\nAnd of course I do get high for the occasional party or whatever. No big deal. As long as you know what youre doing and youre careful, everythings just fine.\n\nPeace"

"Many grants are for a check, to do with what you will.  If you spend it on books, you may not have it for rent.  If you spend it on rent, you may not have it for food.  Ain't college life grand!  \n\nActually, when I went to college in the 1970s, there was a thing which was a federal program, later called Pell Grants, I think, and is now named after some other politician.  The financial aid office would figure out a minimalist cost of survival kind of budget for freshmen, and the feds would come up with the whole thing; I used to joke that they were even paying for my tampons.  The program then assumed I would work and save money over the summer (work yes; save?), and accordingly reduced the grant the second year.  They also expected me to work part-time during the school year, so the grants kept getting smaller.  I got loans to make up the difference.  If you have no money from your parents at all, and no savings, such a program is probably still available.  Ask the financial aid office about grants to ""disadvantaged students.""  That's minorities and what we used to call po' white trash (me)."

"In England and France, the early 1500's brought the rise of the pavane. In the 1580's, Arbeau's Orchesographie cites the decline of the basse dance and pavane and describes those dances as well as the alman (almain, allemande), the branle (in many variations), the galliard and tordion, the canarie (the Spanish Canario), and the lavolta. A number of Arbeau's branles are dances from masques which evolved into social dances; others which remain more performance than social include the morisque (Morris) and bouffons. \n\nAlso beginning in the late 16th century and continuing into the late 17th century, several English manuscripts often associated with the Inns of Court describe a number of pavanes and almans as part of the sequence of eight dances collectively known as the ""Old Measures"", as well as galliards and a number of other dances."

"Note that the direction of the written language has nothing whatsoever\n   to do with the way clocks run.\n   \n   The clock is a mechanical timepiece modeled on its predecessor, the\n   sundial. North of the Tropic of Cancer, the sun affects the sundial in\n   the following way:\n     * Sun rises in the east: shadow falls in the west.\n     * Sun, at noon, is south: shadow falls in the north.\n     * Sun sets in the west: shadow falls in the east.\n       \n   The shadow moves in a W to N to E rotation, which is what we call\n   ""clockwise."" When mechanical clocks were invented, this rotation was\n   duplicated. Regardless of the direction of your written language, the\n   clock hands move the wrong way half the time!\n   \n   South of the Tropic of Capricorn, a sundial moves counter-clockwise,\n   and between the tropics, the motion of the shadow depends on the time\n   of year. Had the clock been an invention of South American Indians or\n   Southern Africans, ""clockwise"" would likely mean the opposite\n   rotation."
It's been years since I read it. Refresh my memory...
First the brain was taken out. There were three different ways to extract the brain, used in different time periods that mummies were made: \n\n\nIn the early times, the brain was taken out by sticking a hook up the nose until it grabbed the brain so that they could pull it out through the nostrils. \nLater, they would take one of the eyes out and pull the brain out by sticking a hook into the hole where the optic nerve connected to the brain. \nThe last mummies made in Egypt had their brains extracted by poking a small hole in the scull in the back of the head. \nAfter the brain was taken out, the lungs, stomach, liver and intestines were taken out through an incision in the left side of the body, embalmed, and put in canopic jars. To fill the empty space in the body, bags of natron and sweet-smelling spices were placed inside the body. Originally, the heart was left in because it was thought to be easier for Anubis to weigh the heart against a feather to see if the person had led and honest life. In later times, the heart was taken out, embalmed and replaced by a stone scarab amulet as a symbol of renewed life. \n\n\n \nThe hole where the internal organs were taken out was covered with an embossed golden panel that had a picture of the eye of Udjat, the magic eye of Horus, who protected the dead. \n\nThen the body was covered with natron and put on a slanted table with a jar at the bottom, near the lower end, so that the water extracted could be collected. The natron also acted as a fat dissolver and a weak antiseptic. The body was dried out for forty days. \n\n After forty days, the mummy was cleaned off with oils and brushes so that no water would get into the body. \n\nIn later times, the mummy had a layer of tree sap, or resin, put on it to help preserve it. To keep the skin soft and smooth, it was rubbed with gum, cedar oil, wax and natron. \n\nThen the body was covered with jewelry and sacred necklaces. Before the mummy was put in the coffins and sarcophagus, it was wrapped with many layers of linen strips. \n\nSmall dolls that looked like the mummy, called shabtis, were put in the wrappings. They were supposed to work in the fields for the mummy in the next life. \n\nFinally, the mummy was put in three coffins and the sarcophagus, which was already in the tomb. \n\nThe whole embalming process took seventy days.
It's 75%.\n\n100/4 = 25\n25 x 3 = 75\n\nYou can't calculate a GPA by percentage because it's misleading...it makes it sound like a C average.\n\nI would do it the opposite way and say a 3.0 is a B/B-, so it's 80%-85%.

I have done quite a bit of legwork on this issue, and have not had much success in finding out how someone who is not a US citizen might get a teaching job, even though I understand there is a shortage of teachers.  \n\nSo far I have found out that you have to find a school district that is willing to sponsor you.  I have contacted many districts, and quite a few reply, but so far I have not found one that sponsors someone who is not a US citizen.  \n\nIf your country of origin makes you eligible for the green card lottery you may be successful that way.  I am not eligible since I am Canadian.\n\nDo a state by state search for school districts and begin making contacts.  Also begin to check out teacher certification in the state you are interested in as requirements can vary.  As far as I can understand, some states accept the credentials of other states and some do not.  Not all international credentials are accepted so you also need to check that out.  You will have to write some exams in order to become qualified in any case.  YOu can find sample exams in all the different areas on line.\n\nI have included some sites that may be helpful to you.
There are numerous uses for acids.\n\nCar batteries\nCar batteries use sulfuric acid to help create and \nstore electricity. Sulfuric acid is a very strong acid that will eat a hole in a piece of iron, as well as eat through your clothes and skin. You should always use extreme caution when handling a car battery.\n\nStomach acids\nYour stomach has acids that help break down and digest food you have eaten. Concentrated stomach acid can irritate your stomach lining and even eat a hole in it.\n\nAntacid\nIf the body has secreted excess acid, because it is having trouble digesting the food you have eaten, you can get a burning pain in your stomach area. If you take an antacid, it will buffer the stomach acid.\n\nSome antacids contain a base-type chemical compound. Adding a base to an acid neutralizes the acid and produces water and a salt.\n\nAspirin \nAspirin is an acid and can irritate you if taken on an empty stomach. Buffered aspirin has a small amount of antacid to neutralize the acidic effect on you.\n\nOther uses\nAcids are used in industry both to dissolve materials and to create new compounds. We drink very mild acids in our carbonated and fruit drinks.

The best thing that you can do at this point (since it's due soon) is to find a detailed summary or synopsis of the book on the web.

With at least 3 sources, you should be covered.  \n\nI tried to pull some sources for you with just the information that you gave me but I couldn't find anything with just that.  I would need the full title and author to find anything.  As a History major, I know that there are thousands of books with ""American History"" in the title, so I would never know with that info alone.\n\nSearch Tips: Type in the ""Book Title"" in parenthesis with the word AND then type the word SUMMARY or SYNOPSIS behind it.

"closer realted to dog family\n classification of dogs\nNote that the subdivision of Canidae into ""foxes"" and ""true dogs"" may not be in accordance with the actual relations, and that the taxonomic classification of several canines is disputed. Recent DNA analysis has shown, however, that Canini and Vulpini are valid clades, with the exception of two genera: Nyctereutes and Otocyon. These are canid ""outgroups"" and are not closely related to vulpines nor canines. Speothos and Chrysocyon are primitive members of Canini, but might be placed in their own clade. Cuon may in fact be part of Canis and there is evidence that Alopex and Fennecus are not valid clades, but are both part of Vulpes. The Domestic Dog is listed by some authorities as Canis familiaris and others (including the Smithsonian Institution and the American Society of Mammalogists) as a subspecies of the Wolf (i.e., Canis lupus familiaris); the Red Wolf may or may not be a full species; and the Dingo, which is variously classified as Canis lupus dingo, Canis dingo and Canis familiaris dingo."

"The answer is found in Genesis as to how it was done:\n\nGenesis 6:19-22\n\nAnd of every living thing of all flesh,two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark,to keep them alive with thee;\nthey shall be male and female.Of fowls after their kind,\nand of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind,two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.\nAnd take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten,     and thou shalt gather it to thee;and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him,so did he.\n\nThe key phrase being: two of every sort shall come unto thee - meaning the animals where led to Noah by God. \n\nCome to consider it, the animals knew of the flood by their senses (even today animals know of impending danger even before it happens) and the animals moved to higher ground of which the ark was located.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nAlthough we do not know the exact length of a cubit at this time (verse 15), later, it was about 18 inches making the ark 450 feet long, 75 feet broad and 45 feet high, with a displacement of 14,000 tons its carrying capacity equalled that of 522 standard railroad stock cars (each of which can hold 240 sheep). Only 188 cars would be required to hold 45,000 sheep-sized animals, leaving three trains of 104 cars each for food, Noah's family, and 'range' for the animals. Today it is estimated that there are 17,600 species of animals, making 45,000 a likely approximation of the number Noah might have taken into the ark."""

"""Census"" is a complete count and categorization of a population, where ""population"" doesn't have to mean just living things. A census of the birds in your backyard is a complete count and categorization of them, and a census of the bills in your dad's ""to be paid"" box is a complete count and categorization of them.\n\nA ""sample"" is a selection from a population. You can often tell a lot about a population just by taking a sample. If you stand in your backyard and see 50 birds and 10 of them are robins, you can probably guess that about 1/5 of all the birds in the yard are robins (unless you are just looking at the ground where all the robins are). Statistics is the study of how different kinds of samples can predict characteristics of a population, and to what degree of accuracy.\n\nYou can estimate the total of the bills in the ""to be paid"" box without adding them all up. If there are 50 bills to be paid, and you pull out 10 of them at random and add them up, the total of all the bills is probably around 5 times the total you got from the sample."
SCAD (as the locals call it) is a great school with a great reputation located in a beautiful city.  If you can afford it (which can be a big if, because it is very expensive), you would probably love it and get a great education.  A friend of mine went there, and be warned, the workload is not light at all.  They have now opened a SCAD center in downtown Atlanta that is also very nice if you are not tied to Savannah.
the term computer expert can mean a lot of different jobs.\n\na dba - database administrator - is just one kind of computer expert. a pretty boring kind too, if you ask me.\n\nYou could also be a programmer or a software engeneer or do something less technical, but still in the field of computers.\n\nI'm an information analyst/ project manager/ applications manager. To me, these are more interesting jobs than a dba because you work more closely with other people.

"Soil erosion or shoreline erosion?\nshoreline:\nOn property with steep slopes or bluffs, reducing the amount of water reaching the bluff will help with stabilization. If diverting water away from the bluff is impractical, it should be routed through a non perforated plastic drain pipe that outlets at the very bottom of the bluff.

depends... if u gave the sat and got a good score there, don't send your act score. also, don't send your act score to your high school, or it'll go w/ your transcript. if u have to send act scores, then some colleges have the policy of looking at only the highest scores, so they may look at the 30. but then there are some colleges that look at the most recent scores (a minority of colleges have this policy), and so they will look at 25. many colleges will look at both scores and see the downward trend.\n\ni recommend giving the sat if possible...
The guidance counselor should follow district policy regarding sex-related educational topics.\n\nParents have the final say about what their children should learn, and when...and are the driving force behind school board and state legislation regarding the guidelines the district follows.\n\nPersonally, while I do believe that truly abstinence is the better part of wisdom for young people, I would rather have a guidance counselor direct a sexually active teenager toward using adequate protection, rather than see another teen pregnancy or a body damaged for life by STD's.

I have read it and enjoyed it. It really brought out the attitudes and historical elements of the south in the war.\n\nThis historical novel set in the Civil War era was first published in 1993 and is based on the extraordinary experience of one family in the South. The Civil War began with shots fired at Will McLean's house at Manassas and—by an amazing quirk of fate—ended with General Lee discussing surrender in the Appomattox house where McClean had moved his family to escape the war. Through the eyes of the narrator, Oscie Mason, readers can explore the impact of historical events on one family from 1852—when Will McLean becomes Oscie's new stepfather—to the end of the war.
sounds like you got fired.

Levers, pulleys, and wedges are simple machines. Does the concept of work explain why we use these machines in our daily lives, how they work, and why they work? Can you explain your reasons in two paragraphs, taking examples from daily life.\n\nThanks\nBarbie N \n\nThis question is no longer open for answering.

Mostly anything, I know people that are in disability because of depression, others because of artritis and other joint problems like osteoporosis.  Others because of cancer survival, and others because of ADHD or ADD.  \n\nDon't think is easy.  For example I have bipolar disorder, axiety, and depression but I don't qualify as a disable individual because I do have control of myself.  \n\nMy daughter has ADHD, and severe anxiety disorder, and speech delay but doesn't qualify as disable because she is high functional (I have never tried, but I know that she won't qualify 'cause she makes progress)  \n\nMy son he is autistic and because there is no hope of him getting better, my aunt got him on SSI (she is the guarantor/guardian).  \n\nMy boyfriend is on disability because of depression because there is no hope of getting better and it interfere with his day to day life (trust me).  As of me I work a full time job, manage a house full of nut cases and study...someone that can do all this can't qualify for SSI! LOL.

"The main character of Pride and Prejudice is Elizabeth Bennet, who is a very intelligent, sweet and strong girl who comes from a family of 5 daughters. She is the second eldest sister. Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Catherine (Kitty) and\nLidya are the sisters (in order of age). She is also a little bit proud and her pride and Mr. Darcy's prejudice are the matters that bring this story all together. What attracts Mr.Darcy who has an incredible income of 10.000 pounds a year comes to their village with his good friend Mr. Bingley who also has a very considerable income. However, in the first meeting they have (which is a ball that the Bennets throw) Mr. Bingley is immediately attracted to Jane the eldest Bennet sister but Mr. Darcy is quite tired of beautiful girls who throw themselves at him and he even calls Elizabeth ""barely tolerable"".

Calvinism is not a religion, but a sect of Christianity. It has no special holidays that I'm aware of. BTW, the current views of most Calvanists differ substantially from those of John Calvin himself. I believe he was also a murderer when he executed a man who disagreed with himself.
I found some pretty neat sites that talk about the history of the heart's symbology. \n\nThe heart we know has been used for years, since the Ice Age, as a symbol, because it loosely resembles the human heart. It was related to the attirbute of Eros, the god of sexuality, thus some of its romantic connotations. \n\nThe best of the websites is the second one. It has a TON of information on the cultural history of the heart. If you go to Culture --> Civilization, you'll get info like this:\n\n  All of the ancient cultures shared one trait in common in how they perceived the heart. They thought that the heart was the center of emotion. The Egyptians, for instance, thought the heart to be the most important organ. They would embalm bodies by removing the organs and placing them in ceramic containers to be buried with the body. However, the heart would be the only organ left in the body. They felt the heart played an important role in the afterlife. As legend has it, if the heart (representing conscience) weighs less than the feather (representing truth) then the person will be allowed to live in the afterlife. The Egyptians thought the heart generated thought and emotion. They had no conception of the mind (brain). \n\n    Along with the Egyptians, the ancient Greeks thought the soul was associated with the heart as well.  The Greeks found that the heart was even more firm than the liver, and therefore, they interpreted this to mean that it had great significance in the human life.\n\nThe word, lev (meaning “heart” in Hebrew) is found 190 times in the Jewish bible. It is always understood that emotional and spiritual behavior is associated with the heart.\n\nHope that helps!

"The Navajo Nation\nThe largest U.S. Indian tribe, the Navajo Nation consists of more than 298,000 members, about 106,807 of whom live in New Mexico, according to Census 2000 figures. The reservation includes approximately 27,000 square miles. Its boundaries extend from northwestern New Mexico into northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah, larger than many states.\nThree smaller bands of Navajos are also located away from the main reservation boundaries at Alamo, To'hajiilee and Ramah. Key cities include Crownpoint, Shiprock, Alamo, To'hajiilee and Ramah. The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, Ariz., located about 25 miles northwest of Gallup.\n\nDiné is what the Navajo people call themselves in their own language, meaning ""The People."" The Spanish, it is believed, gave the term Navajo, to them when they entered the Southwest. They have endured much suffering in their past, including the infamous Long Walk in 1860 when the U.S. Army forcibly marched more than 8,000 Navajos to Bosque Redondo near Fort Sumner where they were incarcerated for four years before being allowed to return to their homeland. The Treaty of 1864 was established between the Navajos and the U.S. Government, creating the basis for relations still honored today.\n\nThe Navajo Nation is rich in natural and cultural resources. Major attractions include Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park (435-727-5870) and Canyon de Chelly National Monument (928-647-5500) www.nps.gov.chcu in Arizona and parts of Utah. View the Chuska Mountains and Church Rock (visible from Red Rock State Park near Gallup). Chaco Culture National Historical Park (505-786-7014) www.nps.gov.chcu, the Bisti Badlands and Ship Rock Peak also present interesting sites to visit.\n\nCamping, hiking, hunting, and fishing are allowed in various areas with a permit. For more information, call the Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation Department at (928) 871-6636, 871-6647, or the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife at (928) 871-6451, 871-6452.\n\nArt lovers will marvel at the sheer number of Navajo rugs, sand paintings, jewelry and other traditional crafts available throughout the reservation at various trading posts as well as at the tribally owned Navajo Arts & Crafts Enterprise stores, (928) 871-4090. Impressive Navajo silversmithing and dramatically patterned rugs and wall hangings are for sale at monthly auctions in Crownpoint (third Friday of each month) and elsewhere, (505) 786-7386.\n\nIn early October, Shiprock hosts the annual Northern Navajo Fair and Nightway Chant (Yei-Be-Chei Healing Ceremony). No recordings or photos are allowed at the ceremony. Also, visit the Four Corners Navajo Tribal Park, which has a visitor center, demonstration center, Navajo arts and crafts booths, picnic tables and restrooms. P.O. Box 2520, Window Rock, Ariz. 86515; (928) 871-6647, fax: 871-6637. www.navajonationparks.org\n\nThe tribe also hosts the annual Fourth of July Celebration and PRCA Rodeo in Window Rock, as well as the Navajo Nation Fair, usually the Wednesday through Sunday following Labor Day. Billed as ""The World's Largest American Indian Fair,"" the event features a multisanctioned All-Indian Rodeo, traditional Navajo food, song and dance, an intertribal powwow, concerts, parade, the Miss Navajo Nation Pageant and exhibits. Contact the Navajo Nation Fair Office at (928) 871-6478. www.navajonationfair.com\n\nOther places of interest include the Navajo Nation Museum and Library, Ch'ihootso Indian Marketplace, Navajo Nation Zoo and the tribal headquarters, all located in Window Rock. The Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site (928-755-3475) www.nps.gov/hutr, near Ganado, Ariz., is also a fascinating place to visit and shop.\n\nAlso, visit the Four Corners Navajo Tribal Park, which has a visitor center, demonstration center, Navajo arts and crafts booths, picnic tables and restrooms.

"You need to look up the meaning of ""serf."" Serfs did not live in towns; they lived in the servant quarters of a mansion or castle, occasionally in a cottage on the lord's lands, and worked the fields for the master of the land. They were a step up from slaves because they usually owned a small plot of land for their own produce, but they had to pay taxes, and had to give priority to the lord's needs.\n\nIf the lord owned a large amount of land, the serfs, including craftsmen like smiths, would live together or in small cottages near each other in a village, even more than one village. They were not towns in the sense we use today. Barter was often used for obtaining goods that were not produced or made at home.\n\nObviously, the villages allowed persons with different skills to live together and satisfy their needs as well as the needs of the lord. As time went on, the serfs were paid in money rather than in just the protection the lord offered, and the lords began to realize that they could make more by taxing or charging the serfs for services. The serfs realized they could act together to oppose things like high fees for grinding wheat or corn, or even set up their own mills on their own land. The feudal system was coming to an end.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serf"

The downside of having dogs is that you will have to pick up their poop or hire someone to pick it up for you.\n\nDepending on how old the cat is, it may be lazy or it may be energetic and a pretty fun companion to have around the house. The downside to having cats is that you have to clean the kitty litter and they cough up hairballs quite often. Also, my cat annoys me sometimes because she follows me around the house and sits down where ever I go, then she just sits their and licks herself and stares at me.\n\nI used to have 2 other dogs and a guinea pig. They were very fun to me as a child. I have 2 cats and 2 dogs at the moment. My cats slap my dogs if they get to close, which is always funny to watch since my dogs are just sniffing around. I like my cat because I can roll her onto her back and she will just lay there for a while. My dog is always running around and is fun to play with when ever im bored.\n\nI personally like my dogs more because my dogs are energetic unlike my lazy cat who annoys me most of the time. Although, my cat is easier to take care of, I still prefer my dog! ^.^

The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.

France also kept the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique because of their rich sugar crops and the ease with which it could be controlled. Spain gained Louisiana in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.\n\nOne result of the war was that Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River that now forms part of the Province of Quebec with approximately 54,000 French-speaking, Roman Catholic population. Near the beginning of the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French-speaking populations in Acadia to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population, but this would not be repeated in 1763.\n\nThe European theater of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763.

It is the smallest (non-zero) number that is a multiple of the denominators. For instance, the LCD of {1/2, 1/4} is 4 because the least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4. Likewise the LCD of {1/2, 1/3} is 6.\n\nBy using this (or any multiple of it) as a denominator, it enables addition, subtraction or comparison of fractions:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4; \n1/2 − 1/3 = 3/6 − 2/6 = 1/6; \n1/3 < 2/5 since 5/15 < 6/15.

"Seventy times seven come up in Matthew 18:21-22 specifically.  But in context it is about forgiveness.  Peter asks Jesus how many times he should forgive his brother when he sins against him and Peter reasons that seven times is enough.  Jesus counters by saying ""I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.""  Seventy-seven may also be ""seventy times seven"".  \n\nThere may be other passages, but this is the only one I could find.  \n\nYou can visit www.biblegateway.com or a good Bible concordance (like Strong's Exhaustive Concordance) for more info, and I also recommend checking out a commentary.

"Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. 4 They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, 5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.\n8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, ""Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me. 9 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband."" \n      Then she kissed them and they wept aloud 10 and said to her, ""We will go back with you to your people."" \n\n 11 But Naomi said, ""Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? 12 Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons- 13 would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me!"" \n\n 14 At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her. \n\n 15 ""Look,"" said Naomi, ""your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."" \n\n 16 But Ruth replied, ""Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. 17 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."" 18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. \n\n 19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, ""Can this be Naomi?"" \n\n* she followed Naomi out of love"

"1. Cost- each separate, ""official"" clothing item for the school is at least $50. The cheaper alternative (no school name embroidered) is often not allowed, in order that the schools make money, which I believe is ridiculous, because the point of uniforms is not to give school officials extra pocket money, but to standardize dress and sharpen up the educational environment.\n\n2. There are still other ways to ""flaunt"" your wealth and thus shun others, so the whole point of the school uniform is defeated. For example, my friend who goes to a private school has 134 pairs of ""designer"" shoes (no joke) and a matching designer bag for each, since her school has uniforms. In that school, one girl was shunned and isolated so badly for not having a designer bag like Louis Vuitton that she left the school for another.\n\n3. A normal dress code is reasonable, but emphasizing such a trivial issue such as regulation of clothing over more important matters such as actual education as some schools do, is stupid, as a positive-learning environment can still be maintained without uniforms. For example, my school has a dress code, but no uniform and is ranked as one of the top ten highschools in the nation and top 5 International Baccaleureate schools in the world. To add to that we never have any fights or major problems with discrimination due to clothing choice.\n\n4. It partially suppresses a student's potential for creativity, personal expression, etc."

"Through my experiance the best way to ""control"" students is to treat them with respect, fairness, have high standards, have fun in the classroom, and have a great discipline plan.  Many people like to ""control"" their students but I dont think that is what you want to do.  You want your students to want to be in the classroom.  William Glasser has some really great ideas.  He feels that the classroom is also the students classroom so make them part of it.  Have them help you establish the classroom rules. Dont just tell them what the rules are. Teach them things that they want to learn about. Ask them what interest them. I dont know what subject you teach but have it realate to what they like. Have a great discipline plan. If they mess up they get a strike or they have to sign their name in a behavior log folder. If they get more than 3 strikes than they dont get to participate in ""fun friday"" that occurs at the end of every nine weeks.  Instead of eating pizza and chips with everyone they go to the library or another teachers classroom.  \nStudents will push their limits. But you can not try to control them. Nobody likes to be controlled. Control only causes more resistance. What you need to do is make the class about them."
Being in a situation where you have no choice but to learn the language is the fastest way to learn, but if you listen to the music (works best if you choose a song you like listening to) and can find a web site that has translations for the lyrics, you can learn whole dialogs and conversational pronunciation. Just finding an English version of the song will not help as well because artists may have to change lyrics or verses to maintain the flow of the song as opposed to the meaning of the words.
yes they should ban many of them.\nthe argument really simply is that children are to young to understand the potential harm and brainwashing of advertising. most kids TV stations have adverts that actively encourage the child to nag their parents for the product and encourage the child to behave badly if they don't get what they want. it is done very subtly so many parents who aren't actively watching the programme, which is the most common (kids in one room with TV, parents in nearby room or doing something else in the same room)don't notice the adverts message.\nIf an adult does not like an advert or isn't interested in the product they ignore it. it is not as simple for a child.\n\nMany of the large food and drink companies in US have realised that if you can, through adverts alone, get a child to associate fun and happiness with for example McDonald's then that child, into complete adulthood, when tested, will subconsciously want to eat McDonald's if they feel sad.

"First off you need to ask yourself ""Is this behavior that I have made acceptable view of in my house?""  Kids learn by seeing alot of the time.  Secondly remember that the years 2 & 3 are when children start to assert their independence hence the Terrible Twos.  If it is truly violent behavior do not answer in kind.  The calmer more rational you are the more calm your cild will be.  The energy you would have fed to the situation with anger is not there and it makes the situation smoother.  Now if it is simply taking toys from other children not sharing, biting, etc These are normal things that 3 year olds do.  My son bit a child at school until he broke the skin but the child smaked a toy from his hands very crudely.  And he answered back.  \n\nRemember to break down their behavior slowly and do not try to deconstruct them psychologically.  They are not old enough yet to have severe trauma unless their background dictates it.  Get on your 3 year olds level and speak in small concise words so that he can follow your meaning easier.  Encourage him to express feeling of anger or hurt verbally rather than physically.  When one of my boys has a problem or is upset, I ask ""Does this make you mad, it's okay sometimes to be upset.""  Help them get an outlet and redirect that energy into playing with another item etc.  \n\nI Hope This Helps,\nAmy"

-4r - 3 = -27\n\nThe first step in solving this equation is to get the variable alone. That means without signs (aka, - or + ) and without coefficients (the number on front). so the first tjing you do, is get rid of the -3. In case you don't know this, its not 3, its -3 because well, it just is. To get rid of it, you need to add something to the first part of the equation to cancel out the three, which in this case would be a positive 3:\n\n-4r - 3 +3 = -27\n\n3 minus three is? nothing. but you have to give the other side of the equation a positive three as well (always remeber the golden rule of algebra: Do unto one side what you do to the other)\n\nso then you have:\n-4r - 3 + 3 = -27 + 3\nsince the 3's cancel out, you have:\n\n-4r = -27 + 3\nsince the 27 is negative, and it is a larger number than the 3, you subtract 3 from 27 which is? 24. And since 27 is larger than 3, and 27 has a (-) sign, that's the sign you give the 24. so you have:\n\n-4r = -24. \nnow, remeber, we want the variable alone, so the next step is getting rid of the -4. when you have a number right next to a variable (the letter) it means you are multiplying them. and if you want to cancel out the -4, we divide -4r by -4. so:\n\n-4r/-4 = -24.\n-4r divided by -4, leaves you with just the r. so now you have:\n\nr = -24.\nbut remeber the golden rule of algebra? we have to divide the other side of the equation by -4:\n\nr = -24/-4\na negative divided by a negative is a positive, so we have positive? divide 24 by 4, which is 6. so now we have:\n\nr = 6\nand thats the end of it.\n\nhope that helps!

"The question as to whether & when abortion might be right should be largely a scientific question!\n\nWHEN DOES LIFE BEGIN!\n\nBefore life begins - \nIt is OBVIOUSLY a woman's right to have an abortion.\n\nAfter life begins -\nIt is OBVIOUSLY killing a human to have an abortion.\n\nNot that makes things simple, but that should be the basis of the argument.\n\nThe arguments on both side are frequently emotional and not thought out.\n\n""Choose life; your mother did.""

And in the vast majority of the cases, the woman had a choice before getting pregnant! Birth Control!\n\nYou may religiously believe life begins at conception, but you can't legislate by religion. \n\nAnd just because it isn't fair for a woman to have to have a baby she didn't want just because she waited to long into the pregnancy to make the decision, does that mean it's fair to kill the baby?\n\nEven in cases of rape or incest, the question of whether the fetus is a human life, or a lump of tissue should central.   I'm not trying to minimize the hell a woman would go through in this situation, I'm just saying the baby doesn't cease to be a baby (IF development is that far along).\n\nSo what I'd like to see is SCIENTIFIC DATA to determine when life begins."

You said yourself that the builder agreed to accept 10k for the work.  If the work costs the builder more than that, through no fault of the customer, then the builder has screwed up and gets to eat the loss.  The builder is lucky the customer paid some extra, because there was no legal reason he could be forced to do so.\n\nThe builder needs to be more careful about the deals he makes, make sure he estimates job costs better, and maybe include something in the agreement about handling cost overruns in the future.

I don't know if I fully understand your question but if it is how you can improve your math skills quickly then here are some tips:\n\nFor math, practice makes perfect so doing extra problems until you get the concept really does help. I'm not sure which level math you are at but there are a great set of books that talk about math from a different perspective using wizards, trolls, kings and such -- the characters and story are really goofy but more fun than looking through a standard math book and it really does make it stick or at least it did for my son who got a 710 on the math portion of the SAT's while in 9th grade. I have included links for you to look at them below but your library might have a copy or tow you can look through. It explains the concepts to help get you through.

Get a study partner, someone with whom you're comfortable that usually makes better grades - try to adopt any strategies they use that you're comfortable with.  Also, make use of the office hours offered by your professors.  They not only can clear things up for you, but may give you helpful hints on what or how to study, and if your grade is right on the line showing interest can only help your cause.

I believe that schools should not start prior to 9:00 AM. It is proven that teenagers are NOT morning people. My daughter is up at five AM to get to school by 7:00 AM. Way too early.

1. Why did the US originally get involved in the war?\n\nUnder Truman and Kennedy, the U.S. became involved in order to supress communism in the region. During such time, the U.S. involvement was an advisory role. This changed during the Johnson administration. \n\n2. Were all oppones of Ngo Dinh Diem commmunists?\n\nNo. Diem pissed off a lot of Buddhists who had nothing to do with communism. \n\n3. Was Diem a good leader?\n\nThat is a matter of perspective. Arguably, he was a good leader so long as he had U.S. support. \n\n4. Was America right to allow and approve of the overthrow of Diem?\n\nNo. This caused a chain reaction of events leading to several coups after Diem was assasinated and destabalized the South Vietnamese government. \n\n5. Should Congress have rejected Gulf of Tonkin Resolution?\n\nThis is a matter of opinion. In my opinion, congress should have rejected it because the resolution was based on a falsified incident. Such information was not know at the time of the ratification.\n\n6. Sate four reasons why we were in Vietnam.\n\n1. To stop the spread of Communism\n2. To protect the South Vietnamese people from Ho Chi Minh and the communists in North Vietnam.\n3. To help develop a new democratic country\n4. To support our French allies\n\nNOTE: No one said these were GOOD reasons. \n\n\n7. Why didn’t the US win the war between 1965 and 1968?\n\nThe war was never intended to be won by the U.S. If the U.S. was supposed to win, military victory over North Vietnam could have been achieved in less than a month. \n\n8. Which side committed atrocities?\n\nBoth sides... War is hell...

"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but potentially fatal disease caused by a bacterial toxin. Different bacterial toxins may cause toxic shock syndrome, depending on the situation. The causative agent is Staphylococcus aureus. A similar condition, called Toxic Shock Like Syndrome (TSLS), is the result of Streptococcus pyogenes infection.\n\nInfection can occur via the skin (e.g. cuts, surgery, burns), vagina (tampon), or pharynx.\n\nThe number of reported toxic shock syndrome cases has decreased significantly in recent years. Approximately half the cases of TSS reported today are associated with tampon use during menstruation, usually in young women, though TSS also occurs in children, men, and non-menstruating women. In the US in 1997 only five confirmed menstrual-related TSS cases were reported, compared with 814 cases in 1980, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [1]\n\nAlthough scientists have recognized an association between TSS and tampon use, no firm causal link has been established. Research conducted by the CDC suggested that use of some high absorbency tampons increased the risk of TSS in menstruating women. A few specific tampon designs and high absorbency tampon materials were also found to have some association with increased risk of TSS. These products and materials are no longer used in tampons sold in the U.S. (The materials include polyester, carboxymethylcellulose and polyacrylate).[2] . Tampons made with rayon do not appear to have a higher risk of TSS than cotton tampons of similar absorbency.\n\nVaginal dryness and ulcerations may occur when women use tampons more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Ulcerations have also been reported in women using tampons between menstrual periods to try to control excessive vaginal discharge or abnormal bleeding. Women may avoid problems by choosing a tampon with the minimum absorbency needed to control menstrual flow and using tampons only during active menstruation. Alternately, women may use a silicone menstrual cup to avoid the negative side-effects of tampons.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Procter and Gamble introduced superabsorbent Rely Tampons[3] , in response to women’s' demands for tampons which could contain an entire menstrual flow without leaking or replacement.[2]\n\nRely used carbomethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption. This tampon design could absorb nearly 20 times its own weight in fluid[4] . Further, the tampon would ""blossom"" into a cup shape in the vagina in order to hold menstrual fluids.\n\nThe super absorbent properties of Rely caused vaginal dryness by absorbing the natural humidity of the vagina. Often this lead to ulcerations in the vaginal wall when the tampon was removed, offering pathways for bacteria to infect the bloodstream[4] . Further, the tampons super absorbency meant that the viscosity of vaginal fluids was enhanced, providing a good environment for bacteria growth[5] . In addition, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) has features which effectively filter the toxins of Staphylococcus which cause TSS[4] . The recipe for disaster came about as a combination of Staphylococcus aureus naturally benignly occurring in about 5-15% of women[6] , the insertion of the tampon adding oxygen to the normally anaerobic vaginal environment allowing for increased bacterial growth, and the tampon's super absorbency meant that women didn't need to replace them as frequently and so left them in place longer.\n\n""Between the spring of 1980 and January of 1981, forty women died and another 902 women were diagnosed with tampon-related Toxic Shock Syndrome""[5] . In September 1980 Procter and Gamble recalled Rely[1] after the Centers for Disease Control released a report in summer 1980 explaining the bacterial mechanism which lead to TSS, and that Rely tampons was associated with TSS more than any other tampon.

The compressor compresses the ammonia gas. The compressed gas heats up as it is pressurised (orange). \nThe coils on the back of the refrigerator let the hot ammonia gas dissipate its heat. The ammonia gas condenses into ammonia liquid (dark blue) at high pressure. \nThe high-pressure ammonia liquid flows through the expansion valve. \nYou can think of the expansion valve as a small hole. On one side of the hole is high-pressure ammonia liquid. On the other side of the hole is a low-pressure area (because the compressor is sucking gas out of that side). \n\n\nThe liquid ammonia immediately boils and vapourises (light blue), its temperature dropping to -27 F. This makes the inside of the refrigerator cold. \nThe cold ammonia gas is sucked up by the compressor, and the cycle repeats.

Neither. You are limiting your future enjoyment if you choose such a narrow technical field and have a good quiz-solving brain. I do as well and chose a tech field. I am quite good at it but it is very boring now that I have mastered it. I did not realize when I was young that there are hundreds or even thousands of jobs that could be very satisfying to me and that one's personal tastes will always change with age.\n\n   My advice to you is to try and get hands on experience at as many different work related things as you can, never ruling out ANY opportunity to BROADEN your education, no matter how unrelated it may seem to your interests. Techs NARROW their knowledge but it is more fun to live a WIDE life. I promise that you will get a few surprises along the way at what can be enjoyable to you if you don't exclude the possibilities.\n\n   I still love a good puzzle but now I look for them everywhere, and there they are!\n\nGood luck!\nW Kennedy

When raising kids, don't forget that parents can be a big influence on them.

Caesar's tragic flaw was confidence/arrogance, along with the inability to take advice from others.  Caesar thought he was untouchable and never contemplated his own friends would turn on him.  He was warned by the Soothsayer, whose advice he did not listen to, and was advised by his wife to stay home; again he did not listen.  If Caesar had been less sure of himself, he would have been more likely to listen to the advice of his wife (I can understand not listening to a random stranger on the streets).  This would have saved him.  Also, his arrogance was what led him to be killed in the first place.  The other Senators were tired of Caesar's rule and afraid he was attempting to become Emporer.  They wanted him stopped.

There's actually no need to choose. Each of those three things you're choosing from may be focused on at different times. Getting too engrossed in one slows your growth as a person. You have to be able to move between different ideals. It's what makes a well-rounded individual.\nTake me for example, I love all the same things as you. I'm also really into Tolkien, Dungeons and Dragons, and the like. Yet, I am quite well-attuned to the realm of science, as I am a registered nurse and nurse educator. I am also a lover of literature as it makes me retreat to a quiet place after indulging into the intricacies of both science and fantasy.\nTry it. Focus on each one in turn. But not on all at the same time. It's easier that way.
Hey, that is a GREAT question, first of all, you need to find your schools science & technology teacher. ask him/her about starting one. then if he/she LOVES the idea, tell them to go to http://www.usfirst.org , FIRST(For Insperation and Recognition of Science and Technology) has the most awsome and famous robotics league on earth. After that you should go around to some of the engineers, computer techies, ect. at your school, they should be intrigued by the idea. your teacher should officially start a team online, order the kit, ect. YOURE TEACHER WILL HAVE TO ASK THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR FUNDING, but schools usually love the idea n e way. the website should tell your teacher how to do the rest...and hopfully i'll see you at competition next year. \np.s. i'm John from team 804 'MetalMorphosis', i should't be that hard to find, i'm the 1 dancing and screaming outragously at competition...i'm also the web designer

#1. Don't move to an area thats prone to disasters or holds that possibility. Earthquake zones, don't live in a bowl below sea level like New Orleans, don't set up house at the foot or on the side of a volcano.\n\n#2. Despite the best efforts unforeseen disasters can strike and the only thing you can do is to put back 2 to 3 weeks worth of canned foods and water. Also allow for medicines and a first aid kit. In this way you wont have to suffer waiting for help  to reach you - depending on  how bad a disaster is, it could take 2 to 3 weeks to reach you.., maybe even longer. BE PREPARED!\n\nALSO - you might want to keep a few POTABLE WATER Tablets on hand to kill germs in dirty water, Should your water supplies run out.., you may have to get water from a puddle or something. BOIL water if possible. These tablets should be in the camping supplies at Walmart or other sporting goods store that handles camping gear.\n\nA good emergency kit for you to put together will include 2 blankets per person. One blanket to lay on, the other to cover with. A portable battery powered radio will be important as well as an LED FLASHLIGHT - all of which is available at Walmart.\n\nAn small portable emergency Power Generator run on gasoline can often be of help but requires safe storage of gas and an additive to preserve the gas for long storage.

well it's going to cost more to move things in trucks that run on diesel so expect everything to go up in price\n\neventually if prices keep going up it's giong to screw up the economy.  certain industries won't be able to compete without access to cheap fuel.  the uS agriculture is really going to take a number.  retail also relies on cheap transport.  we might see gas prices high enough that we simple can no longer afford luxuries like fresh fruits and vegetables transported on trucks and conveniences like driving to the corner store for a gallon of milk.  in the long run we'll  have to go back to moving things on train and canal which is really going to screw things up.

On the positive side, it opens up avenues of information that would normally have been difficult to access in the past, as well as present materials in a way which may benefit those whose learning styles differ from traditional teaching methods.\n\nOn the negative side, it has a tendency to make teachers lazy, as they are often quite happy to let the computer (or whatever else they might be using) teach the class for them. It also makes some instructors less dynamic than they could be, as they are often sitting down in one spot of the class working the controls instead of interacting with their students.

Check out this book, Education and Social Change: Themes in the History of American Schooling, by John Rury.  I used it in some of my graduate work, it covers how schools were changed by society, and how society was changed by schools.  I believe it starts all the way back in colonial times and goes up to the mid 1900s.
Because it is just too much information and can be very stressful and it's probably just overwhelming to try to take it all in at once.\n\nTry breaking everything down into little parts at a time.  Like if you have to study 5 or 10 chapters of a book for the finals, try to just study one chapter at a time each night.  Study good and read through it and take notes and decide to quit after the one chapter, then move on to the next when you are ready, the next day, or whatever; however much time you have allowed for you.

Maid Marian is the female companion to the legendary figure Robin Hood.\n\nThe earliest Medieval Robin Hood stories gave him no female companion. The Robin Hood character at this time was rather brutish woodsman and a female companion would have been out of place.\n\nMaid Marian was originally a character in May Games festivities (held during May and early June, most commonly around Whitsun) and is sometimes associated with the Queen or Lady of May of May Day. It has been suggested that she became associated with Robin Hood in this context, as Robin Hood became a central figure in May Day, associated as it was with the forest and archery.\n\nMarian is likely derived from the French tradition of a shepherdess named Marion and her shepherd lover Robin (not Robin Hood). The best known example of this tradition is Adam de la Halle's Le Jeu du Robin et Marion, circa 1283.\n\nIn narrative terms, Maid Marian was first attached to Robin Hood in the late sixteenth century as Robin was gentrified and given a virginal maid to pine after. Her biography and character have been highly variable over the centuries, being sometimes portrayed as a pagan or Saxon and other times as a high born Norman. (Marian's role was not entirely virginal in the early days. In 1592, Thomas Nashe described the Marian of the later May Games as being played by a male actor named Martin, and there are hints in the play of Robin Hood and the Friar that the female character in these plays had become a lewd parody.)\n\nMaid Marian's character evolved, becoming conflated with the Goddess Diana as she became portrayed as a skilled huntress that fought alongside Robin. In the Victorian Era she reverted to her previous role as the dainty maid. With the rise of modern feminism in the 20th century, the character has often been depicted as an adventurer again, sometimes as a crack archer herself. In modern times, a common ending for Robin Hood stories became that he married Maid Marian and left the woods for a civilized aristocratic life. See also Maid Marian and Her Merry Men for a modern role reversal.
Durkeheim, Max Weber. In general sociologists suffer from intellectual myopia. all they do is quote each other. and worse it's the same quotes doing the rounds. a real sociologist should read/be aware of what's going on IN THE REAL WORLD, which they have trouble dealing with: so untidy and unquantifiable. [the horror of haveing to rub shoulders with the overwashed masses]. \nI should know: i double majored in the subject for my B.A.\nI also managed to get through the three years on about half a dozen socilogists [apart from the stuff theu force feed you for your essays]\nBut don't let that put you off. I got through with Nietzsche, novels [a great source for getting the feel of the `street'] ignoring Marx. One woman in a tutorial quoted `Mein Kamf' and didn't that put the cat amongst the pidgeons. she did not get disqualified for adolf knew the public and played them for the suckers they were.\nand if you don't like their waffling obfuscations, do what I did. write the essays with footnotes telling your version and why the socioligists were talking piffling adacemia. One 3000 word essay had 7000 words in footnotes. It shut them up and I passed.\nGo for it, give them heaps [only after you have successfully enrolled of course] good luck. keep your wits and you won't be bored too much. As for getting employed that is another story altogether.\nMaybe when they come up with something that IS original, then maybe they might be listenend to. Last time i was at uni -a while back- they had just discoverd the word `cognitive'. and didn't they have trouble understanding that with the usual rider: more research has to be done. On what? defining a definition everybody knows about? \nHave fun.

"It depends what you consider a good school.  For instance the University of Iowa guarantees admission for students who meet an ""admission index score"" requirement, which is calculated by:\n2 * ACT + Percentile Rank\nSo you only need to rank in 44th percentile or above of your high school class to be guaranteed admission to the college of liberal arts at the University of Iowa as an out of state student.  This is obviously not the case at all schools and it depends on what major you are looking at, as many schools have higher requirements for students applying for specific programs (other than liberal arts) such as engineering."

"Author's note to The Thief \n\nNothing in The Thief is historically accurate, but I have taken bits and pieces out of the history of Greece and fitted them into my story. The landscape that Gen travels through is very much like that of ancient Greece and like some parts of modern Greece as well. The gods he meets were never the gods of the Greek Pantheon. There was a god of fire, Hephestus, who became the Roman god Vulcan and gave his name to Volcanoes. I changed the name to Hephestia and used it for my ruling goddess, and called the volcanoes the Hephestial Mountains, but my goddess and the Greek god really don't have much in common. He was the jealous husband of Aphrodite and was always low in the hierarchy of the gods. \n\nWhether Moira was a Greek god is a fuzzier question. Her name means ""Fate"" and she was sometimes personified as the messenger of the three fates who were spinning and weaving the fate of the world. Sometimes she was one of the fates, but she was never described as she is in The Thief. Asklepios, to whom the palace physician swore an oath to use his powers for healing, is another mythic figure. He was supposed to have been the son of Apollo and a mortal princess. He was educated by the centaur Cheiron and was skillful enough to resuscitate the dead. Hades and Zeus were anxious to keep the power of the gods for the gods alone and Zeus sent a thunderbolt to strike Asklepios and kill him. Nonetheless, he became the god of medicine and was pictured carrying a staff with a magic serpent wrapped around it, and this is now a symbol for doctors all over the world. \n\nArchimedes was real. He was a mathematician, mechanic, and physicist in the third century b.c His work survives to this day. One of his theories was that a constant amount of water must pass each point in a river in a fixed amount of time. Therefore the water in a river runs fastest at its narrowest point. Gen had this in mind when he and the magus and Athonis crossed the rapids of the Seperchia. \n\nAncient Greece had many more trees and better soil than modern Greece has. Thousands of years ago the forests were logged and the soil eroded, leaving much of Greece rocky, but even in the poor soil, olive trees thrive. Between the shore of the Corinthian Gulf and the ancient site of the Oracle at Delphi there are eleven miles of olive groves, called the sea of olives. There isn't, as far as I know, anything like the dystopia. \n\nIn the city of Sounis that I described there were once walls that defended the road between the city and its harbor. The city of Athens in Greece had walls like these. Stones from these walls were used to build various parts of the city, but there are still signs of them today, something like two thousand years after they were built. There is a lion gate like the one in Sounis, in the ruins of the city of Mycenae which was real. Meneleus was king of Mycenae. Helen of Troy was abducted from there. Its ruins are on the eastern most peninsula of the Peloponnese, that little hand-shaped piece of land attached to the mainland of Greece. The gate is just as described by the thief. Carved into a solid stone lintel, most of the detail has worn away and it is impossible to tell if the figures are really lions. They may have been griffins like those I mentioned on either side of the Eddissian throne. Those griffins are like the ones painted on the walls beside the throne in the palace of Knossos on the island Crete. The walls of Knossos were also decorated with paintings of swallows and lilies and a mural called the Great Procession. The civilization that built that palace was older than the one at Mycenae. It was obliterated, some people think by a volcano erupting in the Mediterranean around fourteen fifty b.c. The ruins of its many many rooms may have been the source of the myth of the Minotaur and the maze. \n\nThe megaron at Mycenae was nowhere near as elaborate as Knossos. It was just a single room with stone "

Birth Control Pills usually contain the hormones progesterone and/or estrogen. A progesterone-only pill (statistically) has less side effects than the progesterone & estrogen pill. The hormones prevent the uterous from ovulating. Therefore, the egg will never be released into the fallopian tube, where it can encounter the sperm. It is important to take the pill several days before vaginal intercoarse because it takes awhile for the hormones to take effect.\n\nOtherwise, happy hunting!

"Like Yale, Harvard is a Corporation.\n\nFrom the WIKI article below:\n\n""The President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation) is the more fundamental of Harvard University's two governing boards. (The other is the Harvard Board of Overseers.) On 9 June 1650, at the request of President Henry Dunster, the Great and General Court of Massachusetts (i.e., the colonial legislature) issued the body's charter, making it the oldest corporation in the western hemisphere. In fact, due to the history of the Haravrd Corporation, its set of laws is written into the laws of the Commonwealth of Masechussets. (Note that although Harvard is today generally referred to as a ""University"" the corporation's legal title still formally refers to ""Harvard College."")\n\nWhen it was originally founded, the corporation was probably intended to be a body of the college's resident instructors, like the fellows of an Oxbridge college. However, from an early date it instead fell into what has become the familiar American model of a governing board -- an outside body, made up mostly of people not involved in Harvard's daily life, which meets regularly to consult with the day-to-day head, the president (whom it appoints). It is self-perpetuating, selecting new members for itself whenever a vacancy opens; in recent years it has always comprised six fellows in addition to the president."""

25 years ago when I was in school we used to feel ashamed to go to a tuition.  Only those who were not intelligent are those who took up tuitions.\n\nNow it is the other way round.

"Divide by 25.\n\n(EDIT: OK, maybe I'm not too bright - DUH! Let me rethink this and I'll provide a ""re-edit."")\n\n((RE-EDIT: OK, so let's assume you have the ""90/80/70/60"" scale:\n\n>=90 - A\n80-89.9999* - B\n70-79.9999* - C\n60-69.9999* - D\n<60 - F\n* - this could differ if you decide to round 89.5 up to 90 to eliminate decimal issues\n\nIn a perfect world, perhaps where there is a 100-point scale to separate the ""90's"" from the ""98's,"" those who really kick butt would have a GPA more indicative of how they rank. As it is, with most 4-point scales, the ""90's"" have 4.0's just like the ""98's,"" and that's not wholly fair. So, we'll say 100=4, 90=3, 80=2, 70=1, and 60=0. That would mean a more ideal 4-point scale (based on converting a 100-point scale) could result in the following equation:\n\nGPA(4) = ([GPA(100) - 60]/10) + some factor to account for any rounding or where you set the grade boundaries (i.e. Is 60 really going to get 0 grade points?)\n\nWhat do you think?

Yarrrrg! \n\nI was told that back in those days folk did not drink much water. Rather, they drank ale as it was cleaner (filtered and sterilized by the brew-making process) as well as more nutritious than water (not just the salt water whilst at sea, but even the town water supply).

I can never focus either, at home there is just too much else going on. What works best for me is to find a cafe or relaxed place to eat where they won't be bothered by you and get a corner booth for a while to study in. I usually order an appetizer that I can slowly munch on and a soda and study for a few hours. I find that if I do this once or twice a week I can get the bulk of my homework out of the way and the rest is easy to do in the evenings.

"The posts by people who have English as a second language are often better in spelling and precision than those of native English speakers. They put more thought into what they type out.\n\nSometimes the sentence constructions are awkward, but that's natural in persons making a transition from one language to another.\n\nMany of the most torturous postings by questioners and answerers seem to fall in the same category as wearing sunglasses in a dark nightclub or a bare midriff on a snowy day -- expressing individuality by acting the same as the ""kewl"" ones. Hah!\n\nThat, and quite often having nothing significant to say, they spew out a lot of claptrap and move on to another exchange, not even checking back or rating an answer. When people think what they're saying is potentially important, they take the responsibility for being as clear as they can be and respond to feedback so that they can improve.\n\nUS Americans, in general among native English speakers, have a reputation for carelessness. Not just slang; Britain and Australia are famous for that. Just plain old sloppiness. It's a stereotype, sure, but most stereotypes are started because there's some element of truth that inspired them."

Mechanical engineers have a lot of responsibilities and duties in a wide variety of fields.  They can serve in supervisory positions in manufacturing facilities to make sure that procedures are followed and parts are being manufactured to spec.  They also do a lot of design work, from designing the various parts of cars to coming up with new elastic waistbands for diapers.  In designing, they also do a lot of analysis, ensuring that parts don't fail before a specified life cycle or under certain loads.\n\nI think of all the engineering disciplines, MEs have the greatest breadth of work and responsibilites.

Better still, don't use either and stick to international units.\n\nLitres or even liters have been legal in the US since 1875. Can we please flush gallons down the pan.

voodoo: A religion practiced chiefly in Caribbean countries, especially Haiti, syncretized from Roman Catholic ritual elements and the animism and magic of slaves from West Africa, in which a supreme God rules a large pantheon of local and tutelary deities, deified ancestors, and saints, who communicate with believers in dreams, trances, and ritual possessions. Also called vodoun . \n\nA charm, fetish, spell, or curse holding magic power for adherents of voodoo. \n\nA practitioner, priest, or priestess of voodoo. \n\nDeceptive or delusive nonsense.

The English alphabet comes from the Roman, which in turn came from the Greek.  The Greek alphabet had 24 letters, and the Romans borrowed 21 of them (the other letters weren't needed because Latin didn't use those sounds).  Y and Z, which were among those dropped, were later added back in because the Romans admired Greek culture and ended up needing those letters to spell borrowed words.  Then, during the Middle Ages, J and U appeared as varients of I and V.  Eventually, they became unique letters in their own right.  Finally, the 2-letter sequence UU or VV (which was used in some words then) became fused into the modern W.  This gave us the 26 letters we currently use.

Generally, a society is capitalist if:\n1.) The means of production are privately owned and operated for profit. \n2.) Money is used instead of barter\n3.) There is a free labor market.\n4.) Decisions regarding investment are made privately\n5.) Production and distribution is primarily controlled by companies each acting in its own interest.\n\nThe Roman Empire would have met 1, 2 (mostly), 4 (usually), and 5 (although 5 generally would be individuals instead of companies).\n\n3 would be iffy, since slavery existed, and a lack of mobility prevented a truly free labor market outside of the largest cities.

If you do it right, not very often.  My wife will tell me if she got off, but most of the time the scratches on my back and the muscle spasms will let me know.  I really think the key to it is communication.  That's where intimacy starts.  If you think she isn't getting off, go crazy with the foreplay.  Tease her forever and forget about your immediate needs, make her lust crazed and with a little imagination it shouldn't be much of a problem.  Unfortunately a lot of guys forget that a woman needs the mood to be perfect.  Guys just take friction, for girls it's about the intensity and lol.. how stressed they feel when they're foolin around.  You have to be able to tell what mood they're in before you start.  I switch it up alot.  Rough is fun, but not always right off the bat.  Make it interesting, be creative but communicate with her to make sure that she's ok with what you're interested in trying.  You should know, even if she won't tell you straight out.  They don't want you to feel insecure, that's embarrassing, especially after the sex.  She wants to make you happy, even if she isn't totally getting off, or she wouldn't be fooling around.  Don't bug her about it, what ever you do, sex shouldn't be a chore, it's about exploration of yourself and your love.
Yes! It basically means dont always put things on others, take responsibility for things yourself and deal with them rather than using excuses.\n\nI.e dont ask to be given a lighter load to carry (dont whinge about problems) rather, ask for a strong back (Ask for the strength to deal with the problems yourself).\n\nThe power of positivity. It really is the way forward, dont we all hate to listen to people moaning about their problems all the time? Those people should be taught this when they are at school! lol\n\nThere you go!

Hey, I am not too sure if you are in the US planning to study abroad or the other way. In any case, if you plan to study abroad and you are US resident, then it can be very cheap to study in most countries excluding UK, Australia and Japan. Universities on these parts of the world can be expensive but less expensive than the US.\nNow if you want to study abroad and follow the country of your choice system of higher education, you actually can study for free in many places like France or next to nothing like Spain (around $2000 tuition a year). You add to that the cost of living but that should be less than the US anyways. The downside is, first you need to pass entry exams which are not easy in most countries. In addition to that you will need a high school degree. The second negativo of studying abroad if you are from the US is that you can't work in most countries, which means you need to somehow come up with money to survive yourself. There is still a good news in most countries $600/month should do it.\nIf you are not in the US then the same applies for other countries, but the US can be very expensive even if you choose public universities because you will have to pay out-state tuition. One thing you can do though is start in a good community college that accepts forgeiners, then finish your bachelor in another school. VISAs for these kind of plans are a bit tough.\nI know alot about this and you can ask me for more information anytime. Good luck

First thing: believe in yourself!  If you think you'll flunk it, you probably will.  So then what's the point?  Aim a little higher, like a D+ or even a C.  Who knows, you could end up acing the thing.\n\nSecond: Get all of the notes.  If you've missed a lot of class, borrow a devoted student's and photocopy them all.  Study those well.\n\nThird: To save some time, find out exactly what will be on the exam.  Sometimes, the instructor doesn't put everything you've covered on it.  Find out all you need to study for, get your required texts and some different colored highlighters and make a scavenger hunt out of it.  \n\nFourth: Give your brain a brake.  Don't study all night long and then try to take the exam.  Get some sleep, take a warm bathe, watch a movie, go dancing, etc.  The important thing is to relax because when you're nervious, your adrenaline glands pump extra adrenaline through your body and block off the messages the dendrites in your brain try to pass each other.  \n\nFifth: Find a study partner.  Chances are, you've missed something, either by spacing out or just because our brains don't work like tape recorders.  Find the biggest brain with the biggest heart in your class and be extra grateful when you find you've passed your exam. \n\nGood luck to you.  Hope this helps.
They are both correct.  If they only have one kind of book than the first way is just fine.  There are multible kinds of books, than go with the second way.

"Prairie refers to an area of land in North America of low topographic relief that principally supports grasses and herbs, with few trees, and is generally of a mesic (moderate or temperate) climate. Most of the Great Plains, including the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Iowa, and much of Missouri and Minnesota, is considered prairie. French explorers called these areas prairie, from the French word for ""meadow"". Almost all of this area has been converted into farmland in the last two hundred years. Sometimes in the United States and Canada distinction is made between the shortgrass vegetation of the High Plains west of the 100th meridian and the tallgrass vegetation to the east from central Texas to Minnesota and southern Manitoba. When this distinction is made, it is common to limit the word ""prairie"" to the tallgrass area.\n\nIn Canada, the terms Prairie provinces and the Prairies refer to the western provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where prairie grasslands and shrubs abound (see Canadian Prairies).\n\nFire is an important part of prairie ecology; natural and human induced fires were common in historic prairie areas. Grazing by animals such as the American Bison and Prairie dogs also helped maintain the original prairie ecology. Small areas of prairies also exist in eastern North America, and it is possible that these were created by Native Americans by periodic burning. One such area was along the southeastern shore of Lake Erie in what is now Pennsylvania and New York; another was between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in present New York.\n\n \nPrairie grassesPrairies are considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Other temperate grasslands regions include the Pampas of Argentina, and the steppes of Russia and Ukraine."

If you think about it, Spanish is the second most spoken native language in the world. True English is more widely spoken, but in the future business will shift to Latin America and China. There are 1.2 billion Chinese who speak Chinese and 1.1 Billion people in Latin America. So if you want to be successful, Spanish is a good way of doing so, unless you want to learn Chinese which is the other language I would recommend for you to learn.
The best and most overlooked way to improve classroom education of any kind is to introduce the use of boardgames. I have taught for over ten years all over the world, and only when I use boardgames do students voluntarily insist on extending their classes for two, three, even four hours. Not only that but they then show the most rapid improvement. \nCheck out the following websites for some useful background info.\n\nhttp://www.rpg.net/sites/edu/1-1.html...\n\nhttp://www.rpg.net/sites/edu/1-2.html...\n\nhttp://subscriptions.fasfind.com/wwwtool...\n\nhttp://www.gama.org/uploads/ns/xx/nsxx7l...\n\nGive it a try and you will be amazed.

If you have already received your financial aid package, don't worry about anything.  Just act like nothing happened.\nAnd, if you have not received your financial aid package yet, don't run to tell the financial aid office that you are about to sell a house for 50K.\nThe only way I see that this could affect your financial aid is if you are heavily depending on federal loan/grants.  If you got or are going to get institutional grant/scholarship, you shouldn't worry about anything.

No, neither arizona elegans, nor its close cousin, Arizona occidentalis are venomous.  Both are constrictors that prey on rodents and small reptiles and are considered harmless to humans.  They are also largely nocturnal and thus not frequently seen (I've never seen one in many years of roaming around the SW deserts where the live).\n\nThe only venomous snakes found in the Southwest US are the many types of rattlesnakes and the rarely-seen coral snake.  We also have the country's only venomous lizard - the large and odd-looking Gila Monster (also rarely seen).

Depends on what your goal is and what your position is. A masters degree is usually a good way to get an entry level management position. Once you have a position that you like, it may have less utility to you. Therefore a certificate program that has specific skills that you want to use in your job might be more useful to you. Certificate programs are a lot shorter. One advantage of some certificate programs is that you can start out in the certificate program and then apply the credits toward a masters degree if you decide to go that route.\n\nIf you want to advance to a new job or a higher management position, what kind of educational background do the persons who are in those jobs now have?

I can not garantee that you would get a perfect score.  However, since you would be practicing the ACT for 2 months, your score will improve.  Just do not stress over the test.  A 23 can get you into college too. Keep your studing to one hour each day, because then you will remember less about the ACT.  \n\nGood Luck,\n\nAlex

"Drinking Water & Human Health in Florida\n\nGroundwater is the source of drinking water for 90% of Florida residents. Public water supply use has increased 134% since 1970. Data from over 1,900 wells in Florida's ambient monitoring network indicate generally good water quality, but local groundwater contamination problems exist. Agricultural chemicals, including aldicarb, alachlor, bromacil, simazine, and ethylene dibromide (EDB) have caused local and regional (in the case of EDB) problems. Other threats include petroleum products from leaking underground storage tanks, nitrates from dairy and other livestock operations, fertilizers and pesticides in stormwater runoff, and toxic chemicals in leachate from hazardous waste sites. The state requires periodic testing of all community water systems for 118 toxic organic chemicals.\n\nPotential sources of groundwater contamination are numerous in Florida. The state's unique hydrogeologic features of a thin soil layer, high water table, porous limestone and large quantities of rainfall coupled with rapid population growth, result in a groundwater resource extremely vulnerable to contamination. There are tens of thousands of potential point sources such as surface-water impoundments, drainage wells, underground storage tanks, flowing saline water wells, hazardous wastes sites, power plants, landfills and cattle and dairy feedlots. Similarly there are numerous septic tanks and urban and industrial areas that may discharge water with undesirable quality. Non-point sources that have vast potential for groundwater contamination include coastal saltwater bodies, agricultural and horticultural practices, and mining. Wetlands (10.9 million acres (4.4 Mha)) provide buffers between anthropogenic activities and water quality of lakes, streams, and groundwater. Recognition of the function of wetlands is essential for sustainable development in Florida.\nConditions in Your Watershed\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency provides information on drinking water systems by county. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Drinking Water Section lists drinking water violations in Florida and the FDEP Source Water Program manages state surface waters.\n\nFlorida Aquifers Data on organic quality of water from the state's principal aquifers are limited; nevertheless, occasional incidences of organic contaminants that may affect human health and welfare are a reality. In the Northwest Florida Water Management District the most prevalent organic contaminants are dry-cleaning solvents and leaking underground gasoline storage tanks. Santa Rosa, Escambia and Holmes counties in the Florida panhandle get their water from the sand and gravel aquifer. This is the sole source for Escambia County. Wells furnishing water for the county populati on are from two to five hundred feet deep. Ten major wells owned by the Escambia County Utility Authority (ECUA) are contaminated. A dry-cleaning solvent (PCE) is the biggest contaminant. Benzene, which indicates petroleum contamination, has also been identified in multiple wells. It is important to point out that rainfall within the boundaries of the county accounts for nearly all the available groundwater. Because of groundwater recharge characteristics, any disposal of waste products or misuse of toxic chemicals on the land surface, whether accidental or intentional, has a high probability for adversely impacting groundwater.\n\nThe Biscayne aquifer has been designated by the USEPA as a ""sole source"" drinking-water supply. The Biscayne aquifer is managed closely to control saltwater intrusion. Water in the aquifer is primarily a calcium bicarbonate type that does not exceed standards for most uses. However, it is subject to contamination by organic solvents used in industry, pesticides and nutrients used in agricultural and urban settings, and leaking fuel storage facilities. Iron concentration in untreated groundwater is commonly lar"

"They are all the same in that the cause challenges to the natural learning process.\n\nThe difference is HOW they cause those challenges:\n\nLearning disabilities involve how a person processes their sensory information, their memory retrieval, and applies pattern recognition. A person with LD usually has average or higher intelligence, and there's a difference in brain wiring that interferes with academic learning. LD people do tend to have something else that they are very good at (art, sports, drama, music, etc.).\n\nMental Retardation means the person does not learn very quickly, and can only handle small chunks of information at any one time. A person with MR needs skills broken down into smaller steps, and each step repeated many times, in order to learn it.\n\nEmotional/Behavioral Disabilities means the person has neurochemical imbalances in their brain causing long-term anxiety, depression, hallucinations, obsessive/compulsive behaviors, etc. Most people take for granted that you act the way you feel, because most people only feel anxious, depressed, etc. for a reason (something has happened to cause the feeling). Most people generally FEEL happy, friendly, positive, motivated, etc. However, someone with an E/BD is punished for acting they way they feel, socially, because the anxiety, depression, or whatever is severe and constant. There is usually no obvious environmental trigger for it (e.g. a family member died, there's a major presentation due, or whatever). And no, they can't ""snap out of it."" Their body/central nervous system is doing it to them. \nWith a mood disorder, doing school work is very difficult because it is hard to concentrate when you're not feeling content, happy, motivated, etc. A person with E/BD can be externalized (posing a violent risk to him/herself and others due to showing the mood issues externally), or internallized (getting ""eaten up"" inside by the pain of the mood disorder and ""shutting down""). Either way, learning won't be taking place effectively."
A “double bind” is a special type of conflict which creates a “no-win” situation; i.e., a situation in which one is “damned if you do, and damned if you don’t.” \n\nDOUBLE BIND\nA paradoxical interpersonal relationship involving (1) two or more individuals in an intense relationship, e.g., in family life, captivity, love, loyalty, (2) the communication of a statement that is manifestly contradictory to what it says, e.g., an order to disobey the order, a punishment that is assertedly done for love (see paradox), and (3) the inability of the addressee of the statement to step out of the relationship with the significant other, the inability to METAcommunicate or to withdraw from the situation. The effect of a double bind is that the addressee cannot decide what is real and may develop pathologies (see pathology).

"Medieval Italy \nAround the year 1000, we have the first documented recipe for pasta in the book ""De arte Coquinaria per vermicelli e macaroni siciliani"", (The Art of Cooking Sicilian Macaroni and Vermicelli) written by Martino Corno, chef to the powerful Patriarch of Aquileia. \n\nThe first historical sources referring to the production of dried pasta in what seems like a small-scale industrial enterprise date from 1150 when the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi reports that at Trabia, about 30 km. from Palermo, ""they produce an abundance of pasta in the shape of strings (""tria"" in Arabic) which are exported everywhere, in Calabria and in many Muslim and Christian countries, even by ship."" \n\nIn 1279 a Genoese soldier listed in the inventory of his estate a basket of dried pasta ('una bariscella plena de macaronis'). A document from 1244 and another from 1316 testify to the production of dried pasta in Liguria, indicating that pasta was now common all over the Italian peninsula. \n\nBetween 1400 and 1500, the production by craftsmen of ""fidei"" (pasta in the local dialect) became quite widespread in Liguria, as demonstrated by the founding of the Corporation of Pasta-Makers in 1546 (the oldest surviving document of this guild, however, dates from 1571) in Naples. In 1574 a similar guild was founded in Genoa, three years later, the ""Regolazione dell'Arte dei Maestri Fidelari"" (Rules for the Pasta-Masters' Art Corporation) were drawn up in Savona. \n\nIn 1584, the author Giordano Bruno quotes a Neapolitan saying, "" è cascato il maccarone dentro il formaggio "" (the maccherone has fallen into the cheese)."

There are six other species of swan in the world, but the mute is the only resident one you will see in Britain i.e. it stays in Britain all the year round. During the winter months you may also see the whooper swan and Bewick's swan. Whooper swans visit the north and west of Britain in large numbers, arriving in the late autumn and remaining until the spring, when they fly on up to their breeding grounds in the Arctic. Bewick's swans come in from Siberia and occupy the eastern and southern parts of England. In some areas, both these visiting swans can be seen together. Large numbers gather together in three main groups; on the Derwent Floods in Yorkshire, the Ouse Washes of East Anglia and at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire. \n( http://www.yptenc.org.uk/docs/factsheets/animal_facts/swan.html )

MENELIK II [Menelik II] , 1844-1913, emperor of Ethiopia after 1889. He was originally ras (ruler) of Shoa (central Ethiopia). After the death (1868) of Emperor Tewodros II, Menelik, with Italian support, gained strength steadily. He seized the throne after Emperor Johannes IV died. In 1889, Menelik concluded the Treaty of Uccialli with Italy. When he learned, however, that the Italian version of the treaty made Ethiopia a protectorate of Italy, he denounced the agreement. The Italian invasion that followed (1895-96) was crushed by Menelik's great victory near Adwa . Italy was forced to renounce all claim to Ethiopia and to pay an indemnity. Menelik took important steps to strengthen and modernize his domain. He made Addis Ababa his capital, constructed a railroad, attempted to end the slave trade, and curbed the feudal nobility. His conquests doubled the size of the country and brought the present S Ethiopia (largely Muslim in population) into the realm. Gradually his health failed, and the end of his reign was marked by intrigue and maneuvering for the succession. He was succeeded as emperor by Lij Yasu.

"the concept of ""childhood"" as being a relatively carefree, unencumbered period of life is a modern invention.  throughout history, children have been seen as additional sources of labor, as pawns in the furthering of generational schemings, or as miniature adults.  it is only in the past 50-75 years or so that we've let childhood be something other than just a period of waiting until the child could contribute to the household.\n\nWhether childhood is a right or a privilege, however, is not a central question of the story.  The real question is to what extent is a society's actions justifiable in the overall context?  In Ender's Game, the Earth was facing extinction.  To prevent its destruction, the governments of Earth banded together against a common enemy and set up Battle School.  While the stresses and rigors of Battle School had a dramatic impact on the children in the system, in the overall context of species survival, the actions could be justified.  The youth of war-torn countries in Africa can be compared to the Battle School children.  Studies have shown that boys who are inured to the extremes of combat are more vicious and brutal than teens or young adults who undergo the same stresses.\n\nSo a possible path to approach the paper is not to ask if childhood is a privilege vs. a right but to explore whether a normal life is possible and use references to the situation in Africa to justify your point."

The U.S. economy was all along booming and there was little improvement as it was consistently high since the 1930s although it was partially affected by the Vietnam War as well as the Gulf war.

This is the best I could find.\nMakes sense to me.\nn. pl. OK's or o·kays \nApproval; agreement: Get your supervisor's OK before taking a day off. \n\n\n[Abbreviation of oll korrect, slang respelling of all correct.] \nWord History: OK is a quintessentially American term that has spread from English to many other languages. Its origin was the subject of scholarly debate for many years until Allen Walker Read showed that OK is based on a joke of sorts. OK is first recorded in 1839 but was probably in circulation before that date. During the 1830s there was a humoristic fashion in Boston newspapers to reduce a phrase to initials and supply an explanation in parentheses. Sometimes the abbreviations were misspelled to add to the humor. OK was used in March 1839 as an abbreviation for all correct, the joke being that neither the O nor the K was correct. Originally spelled with periods, this term outlived most similar abbreviations owing to its use in President Martin Van Buren's 1840 campaign for reelection. Because he was born in Kinderhook, New York, Van Buren was nicknamed Old Kinderhook, and the abbreviation proved eminently suitable for political slogans. That same year, an editorial referring to the receipt of a pin with the slogan O.K. had this comment: “frightful letters... significant of the birth-place of Martin Van Buren, old Kinderhook, as also the rallying word of the Democracy of the late election, ‘all correct’.... Those who wear them should bear in mind that it will require their most strenuous exertions... to make all things O.K.”

Fear of exams is actually a very common problem among school-age children. First, it's a good idea to make certain that the fear is not brought on by a learning problem or disability. For example, some children do very poorly on exams because they read slowly or with great difficulty. They can do the regular homework well because they work very hard and are bright. But in a timed test situation, they can't keep up. One hint of this is a child who answers the first half of the test questions correctly, but doesn't get to the second half of the questions at all (and thus earns a very low score). \n\nTest-taking anxiety is often easy to deal with using relaxation and mental imagery techniques. With a little coaching, most children quickly learn to think pleasant, restful thoughts and enjoy the feeling of their bodies relaxing. They can then give themselves instructions to feel calm and relaxed during tests. Somehow, the body remembers, and they do in fact feel calmer during tests. Many child psychologists and pediatricians are skilled in teaching children relaxation. Some call this process self hypnosis, but I think that makes it sound more mysterious than it really is.
"Yes. The infinitive in your example is ""to push."" And I have to disagree about others' opinions of split infinitives. There NEVER was a rule banning them. They are and have always been acceptable. Some time ago, someone knowing little about English, decided that since Latin infinitives couldn't be split (ha! Latin infinitives are one word), that English infinitives couldn't be split. Put the modifier where it has the most impact without creating confusion. Thus ""To boldly go"" is perfectly fine English -- and a very effective use of a ""split infinitive."""

Divide both sides by 16 to get x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1, which is the standard form. Since x^2 is positive, that tells you that this hyperbola opens horizontally. Because you just have a  plain x^2 and y^2, the center is (0,0). The square root of the number under the x^2 term gives you the distance of the vertices from the center, so the vertices are at (a,0) and (-a,0). The asymptotes are lines with the slope formed by +/- b/a. To find the foci, calculate c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and go that distance from the center horizontally, so the foci are at (c,0) and (-c,0). I leave it to you to do the math, but that's the process for this problem.

"Well if you're speaking about Antonio Gramsci (January 22, 1891 – April 27, 1937), he was an Italian writer, politician, leader and theorist of Socialism, Communism and Anti-Fascism.\nA brilliant student, Gramsci won a prize that allowed him to study at the University of Turin, where he read literature. He found Turin at the time going through a process of industrialization, with the Fiat and Lancia factories recruiting workers from poorer regions. Trade unions became established, and the first industrial social conflicts started to emerge. Gramsci had a close involvement with these developments, frequenting socialist circles as well as associating with Sardinian emigrants, which gave him continuity with his native culture.\n\nHis early difficult experiences in Sardinia had already shaped his view of the world. This, together with his experience on the mainland, had a part in his decision to join the Italian Socialist Party.\n\nHe became a notable journalist, even if his writings were mainly for political papers such as L'Avanti (the Socialist Party official organ); nevertheless his brilliant prose and his intelligent observations soon resulted in greater fame.\nAn articulate and prolific writer of political theory, Gramsci produced a great deal of writing as editor of a number of socialist newspapers in Italy. Among the many, with Palmiro Togliatti he set up (in 1919) L'Ordine Nuovo (also the name of an unrelated 1960s fascist group), and contributed to La Città Futura.\n\nOn the evening of November 8, 1926, Gramsci was arrested in Rome and, in accordance with a series of ""Exceptional Laws"" enacted by the fascist-dominated Italian legislature, committed to solitary confinement at the Regina Coeli prison. This began a ten-year odyssey, marked by almost constant physical and psychic pain as a result of a prison experience that culminated, on April 27, 1937, in his death from a cerebral hemorrhage. No doubt the stroke that killed him was but the final outcome of years and years of illnesses that were never properly treated in prison.\nYet as everyone familiar with the trajectory of Gramsci's life knows, these prison years were also rich with intellectual achievement, as recorded in the Notebooks he kept in his various cells that eventually saw the light after World War II, and as recorded also in the extraordinary letters he wrote from prison to friends and especially to family members!"

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is any sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy infant aged one month to one year.\n\nSIDS is a definition of exclusion and should only apply to an infant whose death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation including (1) an autopsy, (2) investigation of the scene and circumstances of the death and (3) exploration of the medical history of the infant and family. Generally, but not always, the infant is found dead after having been put to sleep and exhibits no signs of having suffered. Some researchers want SIDS to be assigned only to infants of age between one month and one year because of the likely high rate of false positive diagnoses in the neonatal cases when congenital anomalies are difficult to find at autopsy and the rarity of cases after one year.\n\nSIDS is responsible for roughly 50 deaths per 100,000 births in the US. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation; though it becomes the leading cause of death in otherwise healthy babies after one month of age.

Ten of the fifteen largest earthquakes in the United States have occurred in Alaska, and eight of the fifteen largest in the continental United States have occurred in California. Recent earthquakes that affected the United States include the Feb., 1971, movement of the San Fernando fault near Los Angeles. It rocked the area for 10 sec, thrust parts of mountains 8 ft (2.4 m) upward, killed 64 persons, and caused damage amounting to $500 million. In 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake above Santa Cruz shook for 15 seconds at an intensity of 7.1, killed 67 people, and toppled buildings and bridges.

Greenwich Village would be in New York so definitely in the Eastern Time Zone.  On the other hand, if you mean Greenwich in England then there are two answers.  Local time in Greenwich is 8 hours ahead of Pacific Time or 5 hours ahead of Eastern Time (about 9:42 am).  However, the Universal Coordinated Time (which timezones are based) is actually an hour earlier.  The distinction is that Greenwich is on Daylight Savings Time now, just like the U.S. but UTC does not change.  It would be 8:42 am UTC.\n\nGMT and UTC are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same thing between April and October, as you can see.  So the question is which one do you truly mean?  GMT or UTC?

Better name colleges have, obviously, a better name. The reputation that they have a better program could be reason enough to attend there. Being able to say you went to Yale can go a long way, even if you're no better than some guy who went to the state university.\n\nHowever, some colleges actually earn their better name. Some colleges have much better programs than others; for example, NC State University has a very good design school, engineering department, and agricultural sciences department. If you study one of those fields there, than you will learn more than if you studied somewhere else. Thus, often enough, a university with a good reputation might just be able to back it up.\n\nAs an aside, a university's department is a combination of a team of professors specifically recruited to the university for their high expertise, advisors and administration with experience, well-designed (in theory) courseloads, and dedicated students. A dedicated student probably won't do as well without all those resources, so you'd be well-advised to look for a good university.

"Please visit this site, it has more details, i am including some of it here:\n\nThe Pyramids. According to common perception they were built, with the begrudging help of great armies of slaves, by the ancient pharaohs of Egypt as tombs for preserving their royal bodies. Pyramids were meant to be monuments to the pharaoh's greatness, filled with great treasures for the afterlife. To construct these massive shrines, the pharaoh's copied the oldest and largest pyramid of all, the Great Pyramid of Giza.\nBut the Great Pyramid itself contains no pharaoh's body, no treasure chamber, and no treasures. Who, then, designed it and built it? What was its purpose? Let us begin our tour by considering a few basic facts about the Great Pyramid.\n\n\n The Last ""Wonder of the World""\n\nThirty times larger than the Empire State Building, the Pyramid's features are so large they can be seen from the Moon.\nIts base covers 13.6 acres (equal to seven midtown Manhatten city blocks), each side being greater than five acres in area.\nA highway lane eight feet wide and four inches thick could be built from San Francisco to New York and put inside the Great Pyramid.\nThe oldest structure in existence, having been started 4,617 years ago, it is the sole remnant of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n Journey to the Center of the Earth\n\nOnly a solid stone mountain could endure the Pyramid's immense weight. And indeed, a flat solid granite mountain happens to be located just beneath the surface of the ground directly under the Pyramid.\nIt is built to face true North.\nThe Pyramid is located at the exact center of the Earth's land mass. That is, its East-West axis corresponds to the longest land parallel across the Earth, passing through Africa, Asia, and America. Similarly, the longest land meridian on Earth, through Asia, Africa, Europa, and Antarctica, also passes right through the Pyramid. Since the Earth has enough land area to provide 3 billion possible building sites for the Pyramid, the odds of it's having been built where it is are 1 in 3 billion.\n Construction Unequaled by Modern Technology\n\nLike 20th century bridge designs, the Pyramid's cornerstones have balls and sockets built into them. Several football fields long, the Pyramid is subject to expansion and contraction movements from heat and cold, as well as earthquakes, settling, and other such phenomena. After 4,600 years it's structure would have been significantly damaged without such construction.\nWhile the bulk of the Pyramid's core was constructed of 4,000- to 40,000-pound blocks of soft limestone, the outer layer of the Pyramid was made of a beautifully bright, protective layer of polished stone. These outer ""casing stones"" are missing today because about 600 years ago they were stolen by Arabs, (This accounts for the very worn appearance of the Pyramid today, since the inner limestone blocks are not immune to attack by the elements-wind, rain, and sandstrom.) This protective covering was made up of 100-inch-thick, 20-ton block of hard, white limestone, similar to marble but superior in hardness and in durability against the elements.\n\nThe Great Pyramid did not always look as ""rough"" as it does today.\nOriginally it was encased with a layer of tight-fitting, highly polished 20-ton stone slabs.\n\nThe casing stones, 144,000 in all, were so brilliant that they could literally be seen from the mountains of Israel hundreds of miles away. On bright mornings and late afternoons, sunlight reflected by this vast mirrored surface of 5-1/4 acres distinguished the Pyramid as being visible from the moon. (Note: For those interested in possible symbolic significance, in Bible prophecy 144,000 is the number of people-12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel-who are supposed to evangelize the world at the endtime.)\nThe people of the area had viewed the Pyramid and its polished stones with awe for centuries. But when a 13"
"Danville was settled and named by Americans drawn here by the California Gold rush. Daniel and Andrew Inman bought 400 acres of Old Town Danville with their mining earnings in 1854, after living here for a summer two years earlier. By 1858, the community boasted a blacksmith, a hotel, a wheelwright and a general store and the townsfolk wanted a post office.\n\n""But what should the community be called?  In an article years later,  Dan Inman said ""quite a number (of names) were suggested."" He and Andrew rejected ""Inmanville,"" finally settling on Danville. According to the modest Dan, the name was chosen as much or more out of respect for Andrew's mother-in-law who was born and raised near Danville, Kentucky. Of course it also recognized the energetic young Dan who was later an Alameda County Assemblyman and Supervisor."""

"Go to this site:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KKK\n\nHere is some of the info on the site:\nKu Klux Klan"" is the name of a number of past and present fraternal organizations in the United States that have advocated white supremacy and anti-Semitism; and in the past century, anti-Catholicism, and nativism.\n\nThe Klan's first incarnation was in 1866. Founded by veterans of the Confederate Army, its main purpose was to resist Reconstruction, and it focused as much on intimidating ""carpetbaggers"" and ""scalawags"" as on putting down the freed slaves. It quickly adopted violent methods, and was involved in a wave of 1,300 murders of Republican voters in 1868. A rapid reaction set in, with the Klan's leadership disowning it, and Southern elites seeing the Klan as an excuse for federal troops to continue their activities in the South. The organization was in decline from 1868 to 1870, and was destroyed in the early 1870s by President Ulysses S. Grant's vigorous action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act)."

well, you've got the frist thing right: you want to.  that's a huge step in the right direction.  get a notebook for each class, and take notes on what the teacher says.  review the days lessons each night before you go to bed.  keep track of when homework is due and when tests are so you can be prepared.\nsecondly, you need to realize that you're not perfect, and I hope your parents realize this, too.  you're not going to get 100% on every single thing you hand in.  there will be subjects that are hard for you.  accept it and do your best, there's nothing wrong with not being perfect.\nthirdly, understand that many other students aren't going to feel the same as you.  they'll want to play and waste time while you're studying.  they will probably try to get you to follow them, and they may be mean and make fun of you for your hard work and good grades.  this hurts, but ignore them, they're the ones who are going to end up in dead-end jobs while you've got a good job.

"1887\n\n""In this setting, at Lake Vineyard, Mama and Papa had a son on November 11, 1885. They named him George Smith Patton, Jr., after his father and grandfather. A sickly infant whose nurse, Mary Scally, feared he would die in the first few months, he grew into a strong and healthy, exuberant child. \n\nSoon after his birth, the Pattons moved to Los Angeles, twelve miles to the southwest, so that Papa could be closer to his work. Two years later, they had a daughter, whom they christened Anne and who came to be known as Nita or Anita. Although they lived in town, they spent much time at Lake Vineyard, and Georgie and Nita had the impression of growing up there in the country. """
Sellapan Ramanathan (born July 3, 1924) is the sixth and current President of Singapore. Often referred to as S R Nathan, the President was elected, unopposed, on 18 August 1999. He succeeded Ong Teng Cheong and was sworn in on September 1, 1999.\n\nNathan is a Singaporean of Tamil Indian descent; his childhood was spent with his three older sisters and parents, V. Sellapan and Apiram, in Muar, Johor, in a house overlooking the sea. His father had been posted to the Malayan town as a lawyer's clerk for a firm that serviced rubber plantations, but the rubber slump of the 1930s sent the family's fortunes crashing. Nathan's father accrued debts, and eventually lost his job. By then the young Nathan had returned to his birthplace, Singapore, to live with an uncle, and received his early education in several Anglo-Chinese schools, such as the Rangoon Road Afternoon School, and later Victoria School. He started working before completing his studies. During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, Nathan worked for the Japanese civilian police as a translator.[1]. After the war, whilst working, he completed his secondary education through self-study, and entered the University of Malaya (then in Singapore) where he graduated in 1954 with a Diploma in Social Studies (Distinction).\n\nNathan began his career in the Singapore Civil Service as a medical social worker in 1955. He was appointed Seamen's Welfare Officer the following year. In 1962, he was seconded to the Labour Research Unit of the Labour Movement, first as Assistant Director and later Director of the Labour Research Unit until January 1966. He continued as a Member of its Board of Trustees until April 1988.\n\nIn February 1966, he was transferred to the Foreign Ministry. He served as Assistant Secretary and rose to be Deputy Secretary before being appointed Acting Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs in January 1971. In August of the same year, Nathan moved to the Ministry of Defence where he was Director of the Internal Security Department (ISD), with the rank of Permanent Secretary. He was involved in the Laju incident on 31 January 1974, when members of the terrorist Japanese Red Army (JRA) bombed petroleum tanks on Pulau Bukom off the coast of Singapore. Nathan, was among a group of government officers who volunteered to be held hostage by the JRA to secure the release of civilian hostages.\n\n \nSellapan Ramanathan with William CohenIn February 1979, he returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and became its First Permanent Secretary until February 1982 when he left to become the Executive Chairman of the Straits Times Press (1975) Ltd, the Singapore newspaper company. At various times from 1982 to 1988, Nathan also held directorship of several other companies including the Singapore Mint Pte Ltd, The Straits Times Press (London) Ltd, Singapore Press Holdings Ltd and Marshall Cavendish Ltd. He held a directorship in the Singapore International Media Pte Ltd between September 1996 and August 1999. He was Chairman of Mitsubishi Singapore Heavy Industries — a ship-repairing and engineering joint-venture with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, from 1973 to 1986.\n\nFrom 1983 to April 1988, Nathan was Chairman of the Hindu Endowments Board. He was a founding member of SINDA – the Singapore Indian Development Association – and its Term Trustee until August 1999.\n\nIn April 1988, Nathan was appointed Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia and in July 1990, became Ambassador to the United States of America where he served until June 1996.\n\nOn his return, Nathan was made Ambassador-at-Large and was concurrently Director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at the Nanyang Technological University. He resigned as Ambassador-at-Large and Director of the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies on 17 August 1999, and was elected, as the only eligible candidate and thus unopposed, President of the Republic of Singapore on 18

"The ""instant society"" refers to how in our American culture we expect everything right now and when it is not we often lose interest. In the 90's the Internet boom created the ability to access information immediately. \n\nIt has changed our lives because now there is pressure for things to keep getting faster. On the one hand this is exciting because it drives people to improve on current technologies and helps society grow and move forward. On the other hand, it rewards shortcuts and often you see quality traded for expedience. \n\nThere are also concerns of what effect this mentality will have in the long run on our ability to be patient. Some things in life are not meant to be rushed. There is the potential those things might be lost. \n\nIt also creates people who give up on things that they potentially could be very good at if they gave themselves a chance. Because they didn't succeed immediately they lose out. Are we creating a society of people that are afraid to fail and try again?"

My little brother learned by starting with training wheels, but here's what we did a little differently.  As soon as he started showing some confidence, we bent the arms of the training wheels so that the bike could lean a little farther over before the wheels made contact with the ground.  Then, when we was confident with that, we removed one of the training wheels altogether, until in the end, he really didn't need them anymore.  It was a progressive way to give him less and less support but still the illusion of a safety net.\n\nHope this helps.
I don't know if anyone's heard of this guy but a man named Alvin Toffler explained it all in a book called The Third Wave. \n\nHe explains that we are in our third wave of history which is the age of technology and learning. The first wave was an agricultural based society and the second wave was an industry based society. \n\nWell, since we jump from each wave of history so quickly, people experience something called future shock. This is a term to describe a sort of disorientation fromn too much change in too short a period of time. \n\nSo basically, that's why so many adults are overwhelmed by computers and have to ask the younger egneration to explain how to use them. Because, we are in a an age of technology, it's very rare to see people reading anymore. People used to read constantly and now most people only read for educational purposes insread of for pleasure. We rely onj technology to do all the dirty work for us. Calculators, computers, are great examples of this. \n\nMy history teacher was telling us that less than 100 years ago the average high school senior had a vocablary of about 40,000 words. In our stupid society today, the average high school senior has a vocabulary of about 20,000 words. What happened to the lost 20,000 words? Yeah, we are allowing our selves to become more and more moronic.

How many units for the respective classes? If they're all the same, then your divisor is 6, 1 for each class. GPA is a TLA meaning Grade Point Average. A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1, and F = 0. So you add up all the numeric substitutions and divide by the number of samples. In this instance, the answer is (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 2)/6 = 3.0.

I just recently changed careers so I am not in education any longer.  However, I do have some insight into your question.  I think the biggest problem is the lack of equity in how money is given out to schools in a given district.  The U.S. Department of Education gives out money based on a formula and the state divvies it out.  \n\nIronically, schools in districts where the poorer kids live have broken down schools with out dated books, doors coming off the hinges, leaky roofs and other conditions that can inhibit a student’s ability to learn.  Then you look at schools in more affluent neighborhoods, and they have schools that look like a castle and have better equipment and supplies.  \n\nWho makes the decisions about what schools get treated better?  Somehow, it makes it hard for a principal to help teachers and students when he isn’t getting a fair share of the pie.  Students in poor districts deserve to learn just as much as the kids in the rich neighborhoods.  But why is there such a difference in the quality of their schools and accompanying supplies?    Until that question is honestly answered, we will forever have a big learning problem in American Education. \n\nThis is what I think based on what I have observed.

No. The person is not dumb who leaves college because her family needs her or she finds a great job making a good income or decides she would rather do a trade or joins the armed forces or has an illness which prevents her from continuing to attend college.

"Tort law is a basic subject, usually taught to law students in their first semester of law school.  It is the major field of law in which a person can seek a remedy for an injury or loss of some sort that they have suffered outside the context of a contractual relationship.  (In a contract relationship, contract law provides most remedies.)  Tort law covers a huge range of cases, including defective products, slip-and-fall injuries, car accidents, slander and defamation, invasions of privacy, and so on.  Tort law is meant to put people who have suffered a loss or injury back in the position they were in before -- or as close as can be realistically managed.\n\n""Economic"" is an adjective that usually modifies a noun, which you seem to have omitted.  When tort law tries to put a person back in their original position, it usually involves giving the injured person money to cover their costs and to compensate for things like pain and suffering.    Trying to make a person better with money means trying to figure out how much money is right, which means that economic analysis and the like are an important part of tort law.  Sadly, that means it is pretty hard to guess what your missing word might be.  You can email me at milehightaxguy@yahoo.com if you would like to clarify the question."
"How would you define ""better""?  Better human beings?  More intelligent?

Whenever I do something really stupid, I get the ""How's that higher education working out for you?"" line.  Watch Good Will Hunting.  Bit of an extreme example, but a good one."

After studying architecture at the Munich Institute of Technology and at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Institute, he became an architect in 1927.\n\n\nAlbert Speer is said to have prolonged the war for at least a year, with the consequent death of hundreds of thousands and widespread ruin.

"IQ is a normalized statistic with an arbitrarily set mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.\n\nWhat does that mean?  It means that the ""average"" person has an IQ of 100.  People with an IQ over 100, then, are among the ""smart half"" of the population, while people with an IQ below 100 are among the ""not-so-smart half.""  \n\nSince the standard deviation is set at 15, we can use IQ as a comparison tool.  For example, a score below 70 (which only occurs among about 2.5% of the population) is often used to indicate mental retardation.  Similarly, a score above 130 (also occuring among 2.5% of the population) indicates intellectual giftedness.  Most people (about 68%) have an IQ between 85 and 115.\n\nHow accurate and useful is all of this?  Keep in mind that an IQ test is only one way (and a limited one at that) of measuring the intelligence of an individual.  People who are ""smart"" in linguistic and mathematical areas will perform better on most IQ tests.  That does not account for people who are gifted in other ways - star athletes, musicians, artists, people who have a knack for getting along well with others, etc."

Theorists speculate that some of these large planets may have migrated inward because of gravitational interactions with the protoplanetary disk.

This is a general room for the first of the morning where announcements are made and general administration stuff is completed like attendance. The teacher in charge of this class is the home room teacher.  When the first class bell rings, students will leave the homeroom to go to other classes such as history, math, music, etc. unless they have a class in the homeroom by where a teacher will come into the class to teach a particular subject.  This teacher may or may not be the homeroom teacher.

It is a term adopted early in computer use and commonly abbreviated to Gigo. (Garbage In, Garbage Out). It refers to the Programmer's first rule that computers don't make mistakes but in-putters do. Thus if you input incorrect information the computer doesn't know that it is incorrect and processes it according to it's directive. If you put erroneous information in you'll get erroneous information coming out, thus 'Garbage in - garbage out'. It's not a term you hear much anymore.

One thing that is especially important in writing to the employer is knowing a little about the company so that you can logically tailor your words to the position and the organization. Do some research and share what you have learned in an engaging way. \n\nWhen your resume and cover letter first reach the prospective employer, the employer will start to form an opinion about you. How professional are you? Are you detail-oriented, ambitious, responsible and/or qualified for the job? \n\nWriting a good cover letter entails thought and time. Map out the information you want to place in each section, then go back through and fine tune it. Don’t try to write brilliantly from the salutation to the signature in the first draft. Revise it each time you go through it. \n\nMost of all show the employer why you are the best person for the job. Indicate how you will contribute immediately to current projects by emphasizing your qualifications and determination to succeed. Let the employer know that you aren’t just another applicant. You are the one to fill the position.

Someone who is hyer-ventilating must slow their breathing.\n\nTalk to him/her calmly.\nTell them you know they feel like there's not enough air, but there really is, and they need to trust you.\nHave them sit on a secure chair or bench, and lean forward with their elbows on their knees, and look at the ground.\nTell them to try to match your breathing pattern.\nThen YOU take steady, slow, deep breaths. In..2..3..., Out..2...3...4, In..2..3..., Out..2...3...4. Count softly out loud as you do this to help them focus.\n\nWhen they match your breathing for several breaths, start talking to them, in a calm, happy, way, about something you share with them that was fun. Try to get his/her mind off his/her breathing. \n\nSoon they'll be in the conversation, and not thinking about it either, and their breathing will normalize.\n\nIf the person does not calm down, and ends up fainting, their breathing will normalize anyway...but it is an awful experience. If they faint, make sure they don't hit their head on anything, lay them gently on their backs, prop their feet on something about 6 inches off the floor, and support their head with a flat pillow or folded small blanket. They should come around on their own, but if they are out for more than a couple of minutes, and you have smelling salts handy, give them a whiff or two. If you don't have smelling salts, a cool, wet washcloth placed gently against their cheeks may help wake them up. \n\nIf they fainted, once they are awake, take them to their doctor's office and have them check them over.

Well it would be good to know what Subject you are writing it for? ex.

Good luck i hope you get an A+.

Wastewater anlysis comes in two flavors; analysis for biological components (e.coli, etc.) and analysis for dissolved elements (metals, etc.) \n\nhere a link all about it:\n\nhttp://www.italocorotondo.it/tequila/module3/source/wastewater_analysis.htm
The Universe is thought to consist of three types of substance: normal matter, ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’.\n \nNormal matter consists of the atoms that make up stars, planets, human beings and every other visible object in the Universe.\n\nAs humbling as it sounds, normal matter almost certainly accounts for the smallest proportion of the Universe, somewhere between 1% and 10%.\n \n \nIn the currently popular model of the Universe, 70% is thought to be dark energy, 25% dark matter and 5% normal matter. But ESA’s X-ray observatory, XMM-Newton, has returned new data about this content. XMM-Newton has found puzzling differences between today’s clusters of galaxies and those in the Universe around seven thousand million years ago.\n\nSome scientists interpret this to mean that the ‘dark energy’ which most astronomers now believe dominates the Universe simply does not exist.\n \n \nClusters of galaxies emit lots of X-rays because they contain a large quantity of high-temperature gas. By measuring the quantity of X-rays from a cluster, astronomers can work out both the temperature of the cluster gas and also the mass of the cluster.\n \n \nXMM-Newton\n\nXMM-Newton\n\nTheoretically, in a Universe where the density of matter is high, clusters of galaxies would continue to grow and so, on average, should contain more mass now than in the past.\n\nMost astronomers believe that we live in a low-density Universe in which a mysterious substance known as ‘dark energy’ accounts for 70% of its content, and therefore, pervades everything.\n\nIn this scenario, clusters of galaxies should stop growing early in the history of the Universe and look virtually indistinguishable from those of today.\n \n \n\nArtist's impression of very early Universe\n\nArtist's impression of how the very early Universe might have looked\nAstronomers using ESA’s XMM-Newton have shown that clusters of galaxies in the distant Universe are not like those of today. They seem to give out more X-rays than expected.\n\nThese clusters of galaxies have changed their appearance with time, and calculations also show that in the past there were fewer galaxy clusters.\n\nThis indicates that the Universe must be a high-density environment, contradicting current ideas. This conclusion is highly controversial, because to account for these results you have to have a lot of matter in the Universe and that leaves little room for dark energy.\n \n \nXMM-Newton has given astronomers a new insight into the Universe and a new mystery to puzzle over. These results are being confirmed by other X-ray observations and, if these return the same answer, we might have to rethink our understanding of the Universe.

Getting and keeping children in school is a complex family and community commitment.\n\nFactor that affect this commitment are the parents level of education, family's dependence on government assistance, fathers amount, type and attitude to work, mothers attitude to work and influence of father on mother. Whether alcohol consummation is a factor. Finally is the attitude of the family to government school.\n\nLike all children, their level of commitment is a product of the influence as a role model provided by each parent and the direct/indirect influence the parent has on the sibling.\n\nThen you look at the average country school and you see other factors that could affect attendance. The teaching staff needs to be looked at. Do they want to be in a country school and what factors influenced the decision to be in a country school.Even subtle factors as the teachers attitude to reconciliation could influence indigenous attendance. \n\nThen in the classroom is the ratio of white to indigenous students, what effect the peer group(s) of white students is/are, what the effect the peer group(s) of indigenous student is is/are, amount and type of bullying and that could be present in the school.\n\nThen there is the peer group the child could be associating with out of school. Is petrol sniffing or other anti=social activities going on in the group and school achievement by other members of the peer group.\n\nWhat I've described is broad and coarse look at factors that influence the child and there are bound to some I've missed. Each factor should be looked at and an analysis of negative and positive aspects need to be drawn up then how we all can overcome the negative ones.\n\nWish you luck on the assignment

If you have to use the texbooks given by your school, teach only the interesting parts of the topic or subject. And most importantly, be as creative as you can and have fun with your lesson plans by adding your own materials. Also use your own real life experiences, too! Students get bored easily by the contents of the textbooks, and prefer to listen to your own life stories! If you hear the students telling other teachers that your lessons are very interesting, then you are the BEST!!

"Yes, definitely.  Comedians can do skits that are hysterical and appropriate when new, but 10, 20 years later the jokes are not funny.  Why?  Because the times have changed, people have changed (and aged).  It's like music - a hit is a great song for awhile.  The hit didn't change, but the people/times have.  To stay (or get back on the charts), the song needs to be updated, as does the comedian's jokes, if he wants to stay on top.\n\nAn example of how times have changed, might be George Carlin's ""Seven Words"" skit.  There ""were"" seven words that could not be used on television [Da*n, f*ck, he*l...].  But now, a lot of those words are used without hesitating or censorship, and the skit is not funny (unless you remember those days - or Carlin changes his skit to reflect the difference between then and now -- which he has, I believe)."

"From Random House Word of the Day\n\nJesse Krank wrote: \nAll right, the day has come when I found myself using a phrase I used to make fun of my mom for using: man alive. (""Woman dead"" I would reply.) I have heard it used elsewhere but still have never discovered its origins. So, where, when and how did ""man alive"" originate? \nWell, in fact, someone called Frances M. Whitcher beat you to it: ""'Woman alive,' says I, 'what be you dewin!'"" (The Widow Bedett Papers, 1856 or 1846-51, depending on whether you believe the bibliography or the main entry in the 1944 A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles from the University of Chicago Press.) \n\nI guessed, when I read your question, that man alive was contemporary with the emergence of land alive, sakes alive, law sakes alive, and simply alive as mild expletives in the early to mid-nineteenth century. Wrong! In its fuller form, any/all/each man alive, it's attested as far back as 1230. \n\nThere's a nice citation from 1858 in the Oxford English Dictionary that shows how the transition from emphatic phrase to expletive probably happened: ""There is no assignable cause; man alive cannot tell a reason why."" (This is attributed to one Gen. P. Thompson--but oddly enough, I can't find him or his abbreviated work, Audi. Alt. Part., listed in the bibliography. Not a good day for reliability from reference works!) \n\nThe first citation of the expletive use seems to be from J.B. Buckstone's Presumptive Evidence, either 1828 or 1829, again depending on which source you believe (are we detecting a pattern here?). I quite like the following one from Caroline M. Kirkland's 1839 A New Home--Who'll Follow?: ""Man alive! What do you put yourself into such a plaguy passion for?"" \n\nThe fact that Whitcher could say ""woman alive"" shows how productive alive can be when used in an emphatic way, especially in the expressions I noted above. Harriet Beecher Stowe uses it on its own in Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852): ""Where alive is that gal?"" My Montana-based grandparents always said ""man a-livin'!"" These days, none of these expressions is very frequent, with the exception of man alive, which feels a little old-fashioned, and deliberately euphemistic--in other words, Mom-ish. \n\nWendalyn \n\n\nFrom www.answerbag.com:\n\n1. ""Man Alive!"" as an expletive to express shock or amazement seems to have originated in the early 1800s, along with terms like ""Land sakes!"" These phrases and others were developed because Queen Victoria was notorious for her disapproval of cursing or taking God's name in vain. It became more proper to say ""Man Alive!"" than ""Oh my God!""\n\n2. ""Man alive"" actually was a seaman's term. It was an exclamation used, for instance, when a crew came upon a shipwreck to signify that there was at least one survivor."
Unfortunately it takes years for most people to become proficient in a second language. Along the way, you should expose yourself to English as much as possible. Watch movies in English with English subtitles or with no subtitles at all. Read as much as you can. Listen to English radio. Speak English at every chance. But keep up with your own language. You cannot be fluent in a second language unless you are advanced in your mother tongue. \n\nBy the way, DannyK5 doesn't know what he is talking about. American English is more standard from one part of the country to another than British English is from one part of the city of London to another. In addition, English spoken in the South is spoken with a Southern accent, but it is generally standard. Have you ever heard of Southern Literature, DannyK5? Now, have you ever heard of Mid-Western Literature? Why do you think that is?

"Try Amazon.com - they have a lot of reviews of cds, books, movies, etc ...\n\nhere is one review of your piece:\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nMinnery, an employee of Colorado-based Focus on the Family, decries the decline of morality in American schools, media and laws, and calls Christians to do something about it by becoming politically active. He refutes arguments that Christians shouldn't get involved in ""the world"" and that the church's primary responsibility is evangelism rather than social activism. For ammunition he cites Christian reformers throughout history, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe (whom he patronizingly calls ""One Mom Who Mattered""). While acknowledging that ""righteousness is a very broad objective,"" Minnery suggests specific strategies for future activists, such as determining whether or not someone has useful experience with an issue as do, for example, pro-life activists who have had abortions. His rhetoric sometimes overcomes his facts, as when he asserts that ""students who want to meet on their own for an after-school Bible study often face bureaucratic delay"" in approval for their gatherings. Since he provides no examples of this, and since such delays would verge on violating the Equal Access Act, this assertion comes across as hyperbole. Readers who agree with Minnery's unabashedly Republican beliefs will probably enjoy his call to arms and strategies for confronting the culture. Others might wonder why, given the centuries of activism in the Christian church, Minnery feels that such a battle cry is necessary, unless his goal is to revive the religious right's heyday of the 1980s\n\nothers are listed in the source below url."

The cuttle fish is a mollusk without an external shell & about 1-2 feet long.  It is soft, gelatinous brown in colour verging on red & spotted back.  Its body is rounded, elliptical & enclosed in a sac furnished with a fleshy fin on each side along its whole length.  The head, which is separated from body by a neck, is salient and round & it has eyes of a lively red colour.  The mouth is surrounded by 10 arms, which are pedunculated, very large & furnished with suckers.  \n\nThe cuttle fish ink is an excretory liquid contained in a bag about the size & shape of a grape within the abdomen of the cuttle fish.\n\nSepia is a blackish brown liquor found in the contents of the ink-bag of the Cuttle fish.  This is very common in the Mediterranean sea.  This fluid is utilized by the fish for self-protection and catching its prey.  This is done by darkening the water with this fluid, when it is pursued by its enemy or when it wants to pursue its own prey.  This somewhat resembles the smoke - screen theory of the present day navy and air warfare.

It depends what high school you're going to.\n\nAlmost all high schools offer advanced placement courses, but they are usually limited to upper classmen. You might have to wait until next year before you can start taking AP or college level courses.\n\nTry talking to your school counselor, or whoever you go to for programming and see what your options are.

Following the Buddha and the Dharma (teaching), the community of Buddhist monks and nuns, or sangha, constitute the third of the Threefold Refuge, a basic creed of Buddhism. Their behavior is strictly disciplined by the sacred canon. These monks and nuns adopt distinctive styles of appearance and behavior. \n\nThere were a variety of reasons for joining a monastery or nunnery. Pursuit of spiritual salvation and enlightenment was obviously an important reason for leaving secular homes. But some people also believed that Buddhist monastic life would be the best way to serve their social and economic needs. Widows, orphans and other displaced members of society could find refuge in Buddhist institutions.

Going after a new job now would only increase your husband's fear of dying. I am a cancer patient myself and I have reached time when I never thought I d make it for the following morning, but I did. I show all the time that I m able to fight. I wouldn't have pulled through if it wasn't for my husband. I get my strength from him. The moment I can feel doubt in his voice or in his eyes, I get more scared. I live by that till today. One thing I tell people whose partners have been affected by cancer is to be strong and extremely supportive. It is as hard for the patient as it is for the loved ones. \nI wish you both well
You need to ask each school what their graduatuation rate is.  I don't know if EEs take a national licensing exam but it seems reasonable, so find out what each school's pass rate is.  The higher results belong to the school you want to go to.  Also consider expenses, tuition and living.  Then make your own decision instead of relying on what other people say.  After all, you will be the one attending.

In my opinion you could do something in power point with some of the most public news and try to find the same news in different newspapers and how does the media change ther version according to the side they support (for example a newspaper that agrees with the republicans and other that agrees with the democrats). A graphical example it would be in 1982 there was a war between The UK and Argentina, and there were different versions, here the media said that wew were winnig, when the reality was that the UK was... that is the best that i can give you.

Carry 1000 for one mile, eating one, then drop 998 of the rest when she stops, saving one for the trip back to the pile. Do it again. Eventually, she can take 3993 of them one mile. At this rate, after roughly 430 miles, she will have roughly 1000 bananas left (990, to be exact). Then, she can carry them all to market, eating one each mile, and be left with about 430 to sell (420, to be exact) after eating 570 on the way to market.\n\nThis is the greatest number of bananas she can have at the end.
"My sophomore year of high school, that year's valedictorian gave a graduation speech I will never forget. \n\nAt my high school, we had an ""intruder alarm"". If there was an intruder in the school, a secretary would go over the intercom and announce ""Mr. principle, would you please take the Red stapler to the whatever hallway?"" Well, he got up on stage and the very first thing he did was hold up a red stapler and say ""Mr. Principal, I've found your red stapler.""\n\nHe then went on to impersonated just about every teacher in the school, which is quite a feat, considering our school had nearly 60 teachers, if not more...\n\nFinally he tied it all in saying that his time at the school had been a time where he had grown, made friends, and was prepared to move on in his life. \n\nIt really was one of the best valedictorian speeches I'd ever heard."

Well, if you are lucky, a guidance counselor is knowledgeable about the entire curriculum of the school, and can advise you as to the best way to meet your educational goals.\n\nIf you are lucky.  \n\nOtherwise, they are control freaks who have to sign off on your class selections and are responsible for knowing what you can and cannot take, which is also available in the college catalog.

I think they can, if they try to understand each other more.  Muslims believe in Jesus too.  They believe he was a prophet.  I think the radical Muslims we see on the news are nothing like the true Muslim people.  I am Christian, but I do not hate the Muslims.  Think about how many crazy sects of Christians there are out there.  There are always those that make the news that we all just want to hide our heads for.  Think WACO.  If people thought all Christians were like the ones they see on TV, there would be little hope for converting anyone to Christianity.  \n\nI think we all need to just try to understand other religions more.  What do most Americans really know about Muslims?  Real Muslims, not the terrorists that make it on the newspapers and television screens.  Did you know they honor Jesus, Moses and Abraham as propets?  Did you know they believe Jesus will come back to earth again?  \n\nUnderstanding can come through knowledge.... try to learn all you can about what others believe, and never condemn all for the actions of the few. I think that is the way to true peace on earth.
I worked on campus getting my undergrad and while finishing my M.Ed. I work in the schools. Stress relief is perhaps on a day off from work/school (yes i know its hard) take a break from those hours of studying if possible and go shopping or get a massage. I'd not advise it right before finals or a big project *grins* Perhaps if you go to school away from home, try to get Monday assignments done before going home for the weekend and just enjoying being with family. Be serious about your job, but if its not the area you plan to work in after college, just keep telling yourself its only for a little while. Look what I'm accomplishing and where I won't have to work until I retire. That's a stress relief in itself.

"The phrase ""Hair of the Dog"" is used to refer to a drug consumed with the intent of lessening or postponing the effects of withdrawal from that drug. For example, it is frequently used to refer to alcoholic beverages consumed with the intent of lessening the effects of a hangover. It is a shortened form of the phrase ""The hair of the dog that bit you"". The phrase is reported to come from the folklore belief that burning the hair or consuming a concoction involving the hair of a dog that has bitten a subject would prevent the subject from becoming afflicted with the diseases (namely rabies) that the dog may carry."

"Let me just start by saying I am a messiainc Jew and find this question delightful.  The Talmud states that we are to recite 613 Bruchas a day.  A Brucha is a blessing.  This is kind of what Yeshua Jesus meant by pray without ceasing.  We are to medidtate on the Lord day and night, and to hide his word in our hearts.  The cheif way to do that Jewishly is to hammer into the Word.  The Word is the most important thing that we can read, meditate on and pray for.  I will next talk about first the Jewish way of praying and then will talk about blessings.  Yeshua, Jesus being a good Jew used the Blessings in the Beatitudes on the Mount of Olives.  That is the first part of his sermon on the mount.\n\nTefilah: Prayer \nThe Hebrew word for prayer is tefilah. It is derived from the root Pe-Lamed-Lamed and the word l'hitpalel, meaning to judge oneself. This surprising word origin provides insight into the purpose of Jewish prayer. The most important part of any Jewish prayer, whether it be a prayer of petition, of thanksgiving, of praise of God, or of confession, is the introspection it provides, the moment that we spend looking inside ourselves, seeing our role in the universe and our relationship to God. \n\nThe Yiddish word meaning ""pray"" is ""daven,"" which ultimately comes from the same Latin root as the English word ""divine"" and emphasizes the One to whom prayer is directed. \n\nFor an observant Jew, prayer is not simply something that happens in synagogue once a week (or even three times a day). Prayer an integral part of everyday life. In fact, one of the most important prayers in Judaism, the Birkat Ha-Mazon, is never recited in synagogue! \n\nObservant Jews are constantly reminded of God's presence and of our relationship with God, because we are continually praying to Him. Our first thought in the morning, even before we get out of bed, is a prayer thanking God for returning our souls to us. There are prayers to be recited before enjoying any material pleasure, such as eating or wearing new clothes; prayers to recite before performing any mitzvah (commandment), such as washing hands or lighting candles; prayers to recite upon seeing anything unusual, such as a king, a rainbow, or the site of a great tragedy; prayers to recite whenever some good or bad thing happens; and prayers to recite before going to bed at night. All of these prayers are in addition to formal prayer services, which are performed three times a day every weekday and additional times on shabbat and festivals. See Jewish Liturgy. \n\nThe Need for Prayer \nMany people today do not see the need for regular, formal prayer. ""I pray when I feel inspired to, when it is meaningful to me,"" they say. This attitude overlooks two important things: the purpose of prayer, and the need for practice. \n\nOne purpose of prayer is to increase your awareness of God in your life and the role that God plays in your life. If you only pray when you feel inspired (that is, when you are already aware of God), then you will not increase your awareness of God. \n\nIn addition, if you want to do something well, you have to practice it continually, even when you don't feel like doing it. This is as true of prayer as it is of playing a sport, playing a musical instrument, or writing. The sense of humility and awe of God that is essential to proper prayer does not come easily to modern man, and will not simply come to you when you feel the need to pray. If you wait until inspiration strikes, you will not have the skills you need to pray effectively. Before I started praying regularly, I found that when I wanted to pray, I didn't know how. I didn't know what to say, or how to say it, or how to establish the proper frame of mind. If you pray regularly, you will learn how to express yourself in prayer. \n\nKavanah: The Mindset for Prayer \nWhen you say the same prayers day after day, you might expect that the prayers would become rout"

the grass is green becuase in its cells it contains chloroplast, which contains chlorophyll which is used to help the plant with photosynthesis. And the pigment of chlorophyll is green which is to help it reflect green light and absorb other light for photosynthesis. Mountains appear blue from far away because of the atmosphere. Particles of atmosphere have a bluish tint, however, since the particles are so small, you cant see it. As you get farther away, there will be more particles of atmosphere between you and the mountain thus making it look blue.

on the job training...\nJunior College.........
"During my first year in college, my interest in Science was broadened. (How?) There were activities that gave me a brief introduction to the course I'm pursuing (which is?)like the experiments that we conducted in our Chemistry class and the dissection of frog in our Zoology. The introduction of First Aid (should it be aid or aide?) gave me a more brief (why more brief, I think you should reconsider this statement) idea on the work of a nurse and it was very useful (from here on out this sentence is not clear) in times especially when one of my family members needed it most. (New paragraph) As I turned into second year college, I was introduced to new subjects namely Nutrition, Science Technology and Society and Health Economics which gave me a wider interest in the course that I am taking. Our class did a community service and conducted surveys in our Civic Welfare Training Service Program, and from that experience I learned that it is (very sounds over the top here) very heartwaming to listen and assist in the problems of other people. I am happy to provide comfort and help to the troubled and diseased ones. (those who are troubled and sick sounds better and sick does not have the negative connotations that diseased has)\n\nI usually read Science and Health related books and magazines during my free time and I'm very fond of watching educational shows (if you keep the word ""shows"" name specific shows not channels) like Discovery Channel (and should not be capitolized) And National Geographic Channel. Badminton is the sport that I play and I also go to the gym once in a while. Scrabble is my favorite board game. My household responsibilities, other than doing chores, include helping my younger brother and cousin in their studies. (This whole last paragraph is not useful in determining whether or not to admit you to graduate school)\n\nIt needs to be longer and sound more professional.  At this point it does not sound as if you know anything about the profession for which you are training.  Throw in some jargon from the field.  Remember your audience, you are writing to other professionals, not laypeople.  Tell why you have selected their program and what you'll bring to the program.  Tell about research interests.

"The name Australia is derived from the Latin Australis, meaning of the South. Legends of an ""unknown land of the south"" (terra australis incognita) date back to the Roman times and were commonplace in mediaeval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form Australische (""Australian"", in the sense of ""southern"") was used by Dutch officials in Batavia to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first use of the word ""Australia"" in English was a 1693 translation of Les Aventures de Jacques Sadeur dans la Découverte et le Voyage de la Terre Australe, a 1692 French novel by Gabriel de Foigny under the pen name Jacques Sadeur. Alexander Dalrymple then used it in An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, published in 1771. He used the term to refer to the entire South Pacific region, not specifically to the Australian continent. In 1793, George Shaw and Sir James Smith published Zoology and Botany of New Holland, in which they wrote of ""the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or New Holland."""

It depends quite a lot on what sort of course you're doing.  If you're going into science or engineering you're likely to have 25+ hours contact time (time spent in lectures and classes/tutorials) and extra work and assignments on top of that.\nIf you're doing arts or literature courses (e.g. English Lit, History, politics etc) you'll probably have 4-8 hours contact time each week.\nLanguage courses vary as to the amount of contact time but typical is about 15-20 hours a week.\n\nIf your timetable's not too busy it's pretty easy to keep a job, BUT: just because you don't have a lot of contact time doesn't mean you don't need to spend the time studying.  That being said, if your Uni timetable is fairly empty, you'll find it much easier to find a part-time job in the daytime with hours you can work, and to organise your study time around your work commitments.\n\nIf you have a lot of contact time on your timetable, you will probably find it difficult to do all the work you're set.  If you're very intelligent this won't be a problem because you can just do the assessed coursework and skip the exercises.  If you're not a genius you may find it's very easy to fall behind and missing one or two exercises out can mean you don't understand half a term.\n\nAs a general rule I'd say don't commit yourself to doing more than 35 hours a week total, that is, your work hours added to your timetabled classes.  More than that and you won't have time to do the extra study you'll need to in order to keep up with your studies, or you'll end up frazzled, depressed and stressed, which is not what student life is about.\n\nYou should also bear in mind that most people head off to university with the intention of working while they're there and then discover that student life is for sitting in pubs... Most people I know who've set out with good intentions have decided to borrow more money so they can take things a bit easier and drink more.

Yes Sir...or Mam...The courtship between Mary Arden ( his mother ) and John Shakespeare ( his father ) can be pieced together. John's father, Richard, was a tenant farmer who lived in Snitterfield and worked, and grazed his animals, on various sections of land.

OK, my dad has a 12 track digital music recorder(DMR), so...here's how i would do it. Put a CD in the stereo and record the music to the tape. Connect the stereo to the DMR with left/right audio cables and record the music off of the tape. Our DMR has a built in CD burner, so I simply burn the CD.

They are more focused on teaching our children to pass the standardized tests.  My son started Kindergarten this year and there is NO playtime except for a 15 min recess and their main focus is on reading and writing.  Children are expected to know who to write their name before even entering Kindergarten and should be able to read before entering first grade.\n\nThey have art once every 2 weeks and music once a week.  But with the government funding our schools, there is is not a budget for any fine arts.

"""Lombard Street is best known for one block on Russian Hill between Hyde and Leavenworth Streets, in which the roadway has eight sharp turns (or switchbacks) that have earned the street the distinction of being ""the crookedest [most winding] street in the United States.""\n\nThe switchback design, first suggested by property owner Carl Henry and instituted in 1922, was born out of necessity in order to reduce the hill's natural 27° slope which was too steep for most vehicles to climb and a serious hazard to pedestrians used to a more reasonable sixteen-degree incline. The speed limit is a mere 5 mph (10 km/h) on the crooked section, which is about 1/4 mile (400 m) long."

education wise, it depends on the setting that you're interested in working. if its a preschool or a daycare, most of the time a CDA (child development associate) is what is required. it's a national credential and is a very beneficial thing to have if you don't want to attend university. the link is at the bottom if you want to check out the website and get info. if it's in a public school, you would have to check with the school district you are in, because each has their own requirements (some require nothing but a good resume and interview, some require CDA's, some require more).\n\npersonality wise, you should be loving, caring, and willing to give the children your all. as an aid or assistant, you'll be helping the teacher, but you'll have a major impact on the children's learning and classroom experience. the children will look up to you just as much as they do their teacher, and you should be a good role model for them. \n\ni think assistants are wonderful things for teachers, and are vital to a successful classroom. i encourage anyone who is interested to look into being involved in a classroom, because it is the most rewarding experience i've ever had.

"You have asked the right person as I applied to MIT my last year of high school. In terms of college(undergraduate university) admissions, I agree with you, getting into American universites especially the elite ones can be extremely complicated, and tough to get into. I guess since you are from India, you understand the meaning of competition especially into the Indian Institutes of Technology where thousands upon thousands take an entrance exam and of the thousands that take the exam, only an elite few get scores high enough to attend the IIT. The entrance exam at IIT is the main factor determining who gets in and who doesn't.\n Well, getting into MIT for undergraduate admissions is just as competitive albeit not as so for the IIT. But, in the United States, the admissions committee,( a group of anywhere from 16 to 20) decide who gets in and who doesn't. But MIT does not have an entrance exam like the IITs, instead, they look at ""the entire applicant"". In other words, the admissions committee at MIT look at the following\n1)GRADES\n2)General SAT scores\n3)Subject Test SAT Scores\n4)the APPLICATION\n5) Letters of recommendation from teachers and the high school guidance counselor\n6) THE APPLICANT'S ESSAY\n7) EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\n\nUnlike India, where students who perform the best on the entrance exam to the IIT attend, at MIT high scores are NOT A GUARANTEE OF ADMISSION. The SAT is a synomym for the Scholatic Aptitude Test, which is used by colleges and universities throughout the United States to assess the ability of students compared to others. The United States is  not like other highly developed countries where ALL schools cover the same material. School districts for the most part are their own feifdoms, so a standardized test is required to assess the meaning of grades. The general SAT tests students on three areas: Verbal, Quantative, and now Writing. It is now graded on a scale up to 2400, very few people ever score upwards of 2400. Anyway, since MIT is one of the elite schools in the United States, high SAT are essentially required. MIT requires three subject tests: One in Math, another in Science, and another in whatever the applicant wants to take. Generally, MIT requires an SAT score of 670 or higher to be competitive out of a possible score of 800.  Also, the student needs to be active in their high school. That means they have to be class president, win major science competitions, win math competitions, etc. What teachers think of the applicant are very important to the admissions committee. Also, if there is anything unknown the teachers about the student is expected that the high school guidance counselor will speak about the possible hardships of the student and things not mentioned elsewhere in the student's application. The high school guidance counselor also provides useful information to colleges and universities in regard to how competitive the student in relation to other students,i.e. class rank( if the school ranks students). Class rank is a ranking of students on the basis of GPA.  HIGH GRADES, HIGH SATs, STRONG LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS, will work in the applicants favor, but ultimately it is a committee of 16-20 people on MIT's undergraduate committee that decides who in the applicant pool are the best applicants. In the United States, top students generally believe that applying to MIT is essentially a roll of the dice(those with GOOD LUCK GET IN). So many people that apply are highly qualified but MIT cannot accept everyone that applies. The competition is even more fierce for international students as MIT caps the accepted at 8% of the total student body.\n\n****Although, there are those who got rejected from the Indian Institutes of Technology and ended up at MIT.******\n\nSo, I hope I have helped. If you have any questions, just ask me the question on any open questions I may have.\n\nGRADUATE SCHOOL\nFor graduate school it is much simpler depending on w"

I did a paper on global warming and there are a few things to do to not increase global warming but I do not know that anything can be done to slow.  The ways are same things you hear over and over, recycle, fuel efficient cars, factories owners finding different types of fuels to run the factories, stop pollution from air, which is also from factories, cars- so carpooling would help or public transportation, water- people dumping trash into bodies of water also they tend to throw things in like containers of oils and stuff like that, land- littering.
Christopher Columbus (October 30, 1451? – 20 May 1506) was an explorer and trader, who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and reached the Americas on October 12, 1492 under the flag of Castile. History places great significance on his landing in America in 1492, with the entire period of the history of the Americas before this date usually known as Pre-Columbian, and the anniversary of this event, Columbus Day, being celebrated in many parts of America. Although there is evidence of Pre-Columbian trans-Atlantic Ocean European contact, Columbus is commonly credited as the first European to see the Americas because of the profound impact his contact wrought on history. His voyage marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the Americas.\n\nIt is generally assumed he was Genoese. However there is no solid evidence of this and historians claim he could have been born in other places, from the Crown of Aragón to the Kingdoms of Galicia or Portugal, or in the Greek island of Chios, among others. His birthname is also unknown; see the section on Columbus' national origin for a discussion of his origin and names.\n\n\ncheck the rest of the link for more info.

Current popular explanations for the origin of the phrase ""graveyard shift"" reference the 19th century problem of accidentally burying people who were still alive. To prevent this from happening caskets were equipped with a bell-ringing device enabling a waking ""corpse"" to notify the world that they were no longer dead (this is also the origin of the term ""dead ringer""). The graveyard attendants who remained vigilant throughout the day and night worked the graveyard shift.\n\nInteresting, eh?"

"My kids are different ages than yours, but I'm in a similar situation. If you are in the United States, your 5 year old should already be getting preschool or kindergarten special services. If not, get down to your public schools central office and make some noise. Bring in a letter from your doctor diagnosing developmental delay or his diagnosed psychiatric disorders. That help isn't just for him, but for you, too!\n\nMy 12-year-old has a learning disability, psychiatric disorders, and some mild physical issues. He is in a self-contained special education program (6th grader). \n\nMy 7-year-old girl is gifted (1st grader). She is reading at the 4th grade level, draws like a talented high school student, etc., and is currently awaiting the paperwork to be completed to start the school's Enrichment program.\n\nThe biggest things you have to focus on when parenting kids with such different skill levels are...\n\n1. Keep each kid separate in your mind. It is not a race between them about who develops what skill first.\n\n2. Be proud of your ""slower"" one for each thing he learns and each new skill he develops. Be proud of your ""faster"" one for each thing he learns and each new skill he develops.\n\n3. Have activities each kid does separately (e.g. scouts, sports, etc.). Have one or two that they do together. Emphasize to both of them that they are each their own person, separate and wonderful, and that you are proud of both their progress.\n\nRight now your little ones are too small, but there will come a day later on when their awareness of each other's differences is clear and thought out. That will be the time for you to have ""the talk"" with them... In this case, ""the talk"" means the one where you directly talk to each of them separately about the other's differences, and emphasize to them that they are not in a race with each other.\n\nFor mine, I did it the first time about a year ago. We just had the talk again, because my son was having an obsessive, hysterical fit, and my daughter was totally confused by it.\n\nFor the ""slower"" one, acknowledge to him that he, and you, both know that the ""faster"" one will be passing him academically and in other skills. Then start listing all the things you know about that he can do well, especially any more-complex skills (e.g. ...""You know, kiddo, you are one incredible cook, gardener, puzzle-solver..."" or whatever he's good at.) Let him know that you are going to support him in whatever career field he choses. Let him know how much you love him and are proud of him for his efforts toward achieving his potential.\n\nThen get the ""faster"" one, and give him a serious, complete explanation about the diagnoses, special help, etc. that the ""slower"" one is dealing with. Emphasize to the ""faster"" one that you are happy he can learn so quickly, and remind him that this whole thing is not a contest with his brother. Let him know that you are going to support him in whatever career field he ends up choosing, and in exploring and finding his other interests. Let him know how much you love him and are proud of him for his efforts toward achieving his potential.\n\nHang in there!"

"Definition 1\n\nFor a company, this is the total amount of money received by the company for goods sold or services provided during a certain time period. It also includes all net sales, exchange of assets; interest and any other increase in owner’s equity and is calculated before any expenses are subtracted. Net income can be calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. In terms of reporting revenue in a company's financial statements, different companies consider revenue to be received, or ""recognized"", different ways. For example, revenue could be recognized when a deal is signed, when the money is received, when the services are provided, or at other times. There are rules specifying when revenue should be recognized in different situations for companies using different accounting methods, such as cash basis and accrual basis.\n\nDefinition 2\n\nFor the government, the increase in assets of governmental funds that do not increase liability or recovery of expenditure. This revenue is obtained from taxes, licenses and fees."

Medieval Guilds \nThe guilds were an important part of city and town life. Guilds were\n\nexclusive, regimented organizations; \ncreated in part to preserve the rights and privileges of their members; and \nseparate and distinct from the civic governments, but since the functions and purposes of guild and civic government overlapped, it was not always easy to tell them apart, especially since many well-to-do guildsmen were prominent in civic government. \nTwo kinds of guilds were especially important to civic life--merchant guilds and craft guilds. \n\nMerchant Guilds\n\nThe merchant guilds were probably the first to appear and constituted the nucleus for civic organization. \n\nAs early as the 10th c. merchants formed organizations for mutual protection of their horses, wagons, and goods when travelling. \nOften a merchant guild would found a town by obtaining a charter. \nCraft Guilds\n\nThe craft guilds came about by increased specialization of industry. \n\nA group of artisans engaged in the same occupation, e.g., bakers, cobblers, stone masons, carpenters, etc. would associate themselves together for protection and mutual aid. \nAs these craft associations became more important than the older merchant guilds, their leaders began to demand a share in civic leadership. \nSoon no one within a town could practice a craft without belonging to the appropriate guild associations. \nThe purpose of the guilds was to maintain a monopoly of a particular craft especially against outsiders. For example, the harness makers would get together and figure out what the owners of business needed from that trade then allow as many masters to set up shop as the business could support. \nConsumer and Worker Protection\n\nIn protecting its own members, the guilds protected the consumer as well.\n\nMany craft regulations prevented poor workmanship. Each article had to be examined by a board of the guild and stamped as approved. \nBecause of lack of artificial light, work at night was prohibited. \nIn Florence the number of dyers was specified by the guild. In one place it was forbidden to see pigs fattened by a barber-surgeon lest the pig had been fattened on rich peoples' blood. \nMetalware plating was tantamount to fraud and, therefore, was forbidden. \nTo regulate competition between members the guild forbade advertising. \nAll prices were regulated \nCraftsmen could take work outside where it could be seen. \nPrice-cutting was strictly forbidden. \nTo preserve its monopoly a guild forbade the sale of foreign artisans' work within a city. \nThe most important processes used in manufacturing were guarded. In Florence a worker who possessed any essential trade secrets and for some reason fled to a foreign territory must be tracked down and killed lest he divulge the information. \nMonopoly existed within individual guilds through the limitation of the number of masters. \nNo member was ever allowed to corner the market by purchasing a large supply of a product or commodity so as to be able to fix the price. \nServices Performed by Guilds\nGuilds performed other services for their members as well. They\n\nprovided funeral expenses for poorer members and aid to survivors; \nprovided dowries for poor girls; \ncovered members with a type of health insurance and provisions for care of the sick; \nbuilt chapels; \ndonated windows to local churches or cathedrals; \nfrequently helped in the actual construction of the churches; \nwatched over the morals of the members who indulged in gambling and usury; and \nwere important for their contribution to emergence of Western lay education. In earlier times, the only schools in existence had been the monastic or cathedral schools. \nGuilds and Community Interrelationships\n\nThe members of the guild were called confraternities, brothers helping one another. From the political viewpoint, the guild was neither sovereign nor unrelated to society outside the guild and town organization. As a collective un

Satire is a literary technique of writing or art which exposes the follies of its subject (for example, individuals, organizations, or states) to ridicule, often as an intended means of provoking or preventing change.\n\nThere are two fundamental types of satire: Horatian satire, which is gentle and urbane; and Juvenalian satire, which is biting, bitter invective. The burlesque form of satire can also be segregated into two distinct categories: High burlesque, or taking subject matter which is crude in nature and treating it in a lofty style, or low burlesque, taking subject matter traditionally dealt with in an epic or poetic fashion and degrading it.\n\n\nPolitics, celebrities, famous people are good topics for satires.

The Green Corn Rebellion took place in 1917 in rural Oklahoma. It was a popular uprising of Native Americans and poor farmers who identified with the Socialist Party. Up until that time, the Socialist Party regularly won 10% of the vote in Oklahoma elections. The short-lived uprising was set off by when the government attempted to enforce the draft instituted by Woodrow Wilson on the farmers and Native Americans. The rebels saw World War I as a rich man's war and resisted violently. The rebellion was brutally put down and the Socialist Party in Oklahoma was effectively destroyed. Nationally, the Socialist Party was blamed for the rebellion, although the incident was set off spontaneously without their knowledge. This was one in a series of events causing the demise of the American socialist movement and it added fuel to the repressive atmosphere of World War I.

Eau de toilete is kinda like aftershave lotion, more alcohol.\n\nThe water used is not tap water nor mineral water, its distilled water, to keep it in pure state.\n\nOil fragrance, you can buy these in small sample quantity from your chemical shop.\n\nNext thing you learn is to mix this, oil and water do not mix, but alcohol and oil yes, then use the water last.\n\nThe trickiest part is to learn about fragrance, which is why you will need someone on your side to teach you, as you learn by experience and not memorization.\n\nDifferent source have different aroma, there are from flower, animal oil like musk, there are fruits like green apple, there are also from other source like grass or sandalwood.\n\nThen you learn more about how one fragrance mix another fragrance result into what odor/aroma, you learn by trying.\n\nKeep a clean nose, avoid sniffing too much of the perfum so as to keep your nose free and unbias from all odor/aroma.\n\nOnce you learn this basic, you start experimenting, collect some books.
1) Irrigation means that supplying water to land to allow plants to grow, usually through a system of little channels.\n\n2) It has over 700 years history. Legend says that in Egypt near River of Nile about 7000 , in China about 4200 and in Sri Lanka about 2300 before had been used the irrigation systems.\n\n3) The four main methods used today to irrigate fields are flood, furrow, sprinkler, and drip, or trickle, irrigation.
"It should not hurt at all if you do it properly. Lots of lube it to first rule, and communication is the second. Water-based lube works the best as long as there is no spermacide in it because that can irritate the tissue.\n\nYou can use fingers or sex toys to progressivly work up to what ever size you need, just to stretch out a little. \n\nIf there is any discomfort or pain is where communication comes in. If there is friction tell your lover to stop and add more lube, and if there is pain, try stretching out some more. \n\nOf course, there is a small percentage of people, who can't do it with out pain, so if it doesn't stop hurting, maybe it just isn't for you.\n\np.s. There are many products out there that go by some variation of the name ""anal-eaze"". This will numb most of the nerves, and make things easier, though it also makes it harder to receive the pleasure from the act."

Sit and Lie and reflexive verbs. That means that you do it to yourself only. When you sit down you sit yourself down. You can't sit down for somebody else. When you lie down, it's always yourself you are lying down. You can't lie something else down. \nBy the same token, Set and Lay and transitive verbs. This is when the verb is an action taken(by the subject)on the object. You don't set yourself down, you sit down. Anyone who thinks that a person can 'set' down is incorrect. Lay is also a transitive verb. You can't lay yourself down. This is one that most people use incorrectly. Lay is a transitive verb, meaning you can lay something else down, but not yourself. You lie yourself down. \nWhen I hear people say 'I'm going to lay' I always think of a chicken, laying an egg.  \nDoes that help?

Cottonseed oil is commonly used in manufacturing potato chips and other snack foods. Along with soybean oil, it is very often partially or fully hydrogenated. The growing consensus is that in hydrogenated (trans fat) from these oils are very unhealthy. Cottonseed oil was the first oil to be hydrogenated in mass production, originally intended for candle production, and soon also as a food (as Crisco). In part because regulations apply differently to non-food crops, it has also been suggested that cottonseed oil may be highly contaminated with pesticide residues, but insufficient testing has been done

Otolaryngology is the branch of medicine that specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose, throat, and head & neck disorders. The full name of the specialty is otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Practitioners are called otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, or sometimes otorhinolaryngologists (ORL). A somewhat outdated, but nevertheless commonly used, term for this speciality is ENT (ear nose and throat).\n\nOtolaryngologists are medical doctors who complete at least five years of surgical residency training (one year in general surgery, four years in otolaryngology - head and neck surgery). Following residency training, some otolaryngologists elect to complete advanced subspeciality fellowships which are usually one or two years in duration. As with all medical fellowships, acceptance is highly competitive.\n\nFor more info see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolaryngology

"If you look at developmental theorists like Piaget, Freud, Eriksen then ""youth"" is a separate stage on our path to adulthood and old age.  You could even say there are individual differences in particular behaviour such as criminal behaviour etc and you could say that there might be individual differences in some aspects of personality such as locus of control.  So, in that respect, yes, it could be a clearly definable stage although you would have to be clear on what the definition of ""youth"" is."
"I have my Bachelor's Degree in English and these are weird sentences to try to teach you parallelism, but here goes:\n\n1)  The students were questioning many rules and questioning how they should act.\n\n2)  William Blake uses rhyme and he uses moral(?) to express his feelings about the loss of innocence.\n\n3)  Mike both studied algebra equations and he studied how to conjugate two verbs in Spanish.\n\nI hope this helped you see what parallelism is.  After you use a conjunction like and, or, etc. you are linking two sentences together and should almost have a sentence that looks the same on the other side.  That's how I remember it.  I think a simple sentence is:  ""He learned how to play the piano and he learned how to play the violin."" \n\nGood luck :)"

The more honourable of those appointed to supervise his life he could not endure, but the most evil he retained, and, if any were dismissed, he yearned for them even to the point of falling sick. 7When they were reinstated through his father's indulgence, he always maintained eating-houses and low resorts for them in the imperial palace. He never showed regard for either decency or expense. 8He diced in his own home. He herded together women of unusual beauty, keeping them like purchased prostitutes in a sort of brothel for the violation of their chastity. He imitated the hucksters that strolled about from market to market. 9He procured chariot-horses for his own use. He drove chariots in the garb of a professional charioteer,18 lived with gladiators, and conducted himself like a procurer's servant. Indeed, one would have believed him born rather to a life of infamy than to the high place to which Fortune advanced him. \n3He degraded the most honourable either by insulting them directly or giving them offices far below their deserts. 4He was alluded to by actors as a man of depraved life, and he thereupon banished them so promptly that they did not again appear on the stage. 5He abandoned the war which his father had almost finished and submitted to the enemy's terms,23 and then he returned to Rome.24 6After he had come back to Rome he led the triumphal procession25 with Saoterus, his partner in depravity,a seated in his chariot, and from time to time he would turn around and kiss him openly, repeating this same performance even in the orchestra. 7And not only was he wont to drink until dawn and squander the resources of the Roman Empire, but in the evening he would ramble through taverns and brothels.26 8He sent out to rule the provinces men who were either his companions in crime or were recommended to him by criminals. 9He became so detested by the senate that he in his turn was moved with cruel passion for the destruction of that great order,27 and from having been despised he became bloodthirsty. \nCommodus lived, rioting in the Palace amid banquets and in baths along with 300 concubines, gathered together for their beauty and chosen from both matrons and harlots, and with minions, also 300 in number, whom he had collected by force and by purchase indiscriminately from the common people and the nobles p277solely on the basis of bodily beauty. 5Meanwhile, dressed in the garb of an attendant at the sacrifice, he slaughtered the sacrificial victims. He fought in the arena with foils, but sometimes, with his chamberlains acting as gladiators, with sharpened swords. By this time Perennis had secured all the power for himself. 6He slew whomsoever he wished to slay, plundered a great number, violated every law, and put all the booty into his own pocket.41 7Commodus, for his part, killed his sister Lucilla, after banishing her to Capri. 8After debauching his other sisters, as it is said, he formed an amour with a cousin of his father,42 and even gave the name of his mother to one of his concubines. 9His wife,43 whom he caught in adultery, he drove from his house, then banished her, and later put her to death. 10By his orders his concubines were debauched before his own eyes, 11and he was not free from the disgrace of intimacy with young men, defiling every part of his body in dealings with persons of either sex. \nThere is more info on the site I referred.

"An ostrich doesn't actually stick its head in the sand.  It just ducks down when it detects danger, usually in high grassy areas.  I didn't know this myself until last year when I read it in a book for my 3rd grade students.  \n\nFor a grown-up answer, here's a copy and paste job from Wickepedia:\n\n""In popular mythology, the ostrich is famous for hiding its head in the sand at the first sign of danger. The Roman writer Pliny the Elder is noted for his descriptions of the ostrich in his Naturalis Historia, where he describes the ostrich and the fact that it hides its head in a bush. There have been no recorded observations of this behavior. A common counter-argument is that a species that displayed this behavior would not likely survive very long. The myth may have resulted from the fact that, from a distance, when ostriches feed they appear to be burying their head in the sand because they deliberately swallow sand and pebbles to help grind up their food. Burying their heads in sand will in fact suffocate the ostrich. When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds are known to lay their head and neck flat on the ground, making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance. This even works for the males, as they hold wings and tail low, the ""flickering"" of the hot, dry air that often occurs in their habitat aiding to make them appear as a nondescript dark lump. When threatened, ostriches run away, but they can also seriously injure with kicks from their powerful legs.\n\nThe ostrich's behavior is also mentioned in what is thought to be the most ancient book of the Bible in God's discourse to Job (Job 39.13-18)and is described as joyfully proud of its small wings, unmindful of the safety of its nest, a bird that treats her offspring harshly, that lacks in wisdom, and yet can put a horse to shame with its speed."""

"Are you talking military discharge, like Section 8?\nDuring World War II, soldiers with what is now known as ""Post Traumatic Stress Disorder"" would be be labeled as having ""battle fatigue"".\n\nBy 1943 the US Army was using the term ‘exhaustion’ as the initial diagnosis of psychiatric cases and the general principles of military psychiatry were being used. Gen. Patton's slapping incident was in part the spur to institute forward treatment for the Italian invasion of September 1943. The importance of unit cohesion and membership of a group as a protective factor emerged.\n\nUnlike the Americans, the lessons of WWI were firmly in British Governmental minds. It was estimated aerial bombardment would kill to up to 35,000 a day but the entire blitz killed 40,000. The expected torrent of civilian mental breakdown did not occur. The Government turned to the WWI doctors for advice on those who did have problems. The PIE principles were used generally.\n\nHowever, in the British Army, since most of the WWI doctors were too old for the job, young, analytically trained psychiatrists were employed. Army doctors “appeared to have no conception of breakdown in war and its treatment, though many of them had served in the 1914-1918 war.” The first Middle East Force psychiatric hospital was set up in 1942. With D-Day for the first month there was a policy of holding casualties for only 48 hours before they were sent back over the channel. This went firmly against the expectancy principle of PIE"

Female genital mutilation is a very current topic that could use more publicity and support so if your article will reach an audience that can spread the word it may be worth doing. It's controversial in that the men in these 28 African countries still performing the procedure refuse to stop carrying out the procedures on their daughters, sisters etc as they believe without it the women are unclean and they believ that woment shouldn't feel sexual pleasure.  I warn you however that some of the stories you will read are horiffic. I have gathered this basic information from WHO for you in case you decide to chose this topic and their contact details are at the end if you want more information:\n\nWhat is female genital mutilation?\n\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM), often referred to as 'female circumcision', comprises all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs whether for cultural, religious or other non-therapeutic reasons. There are different types of female genital mutilation known to be practised today. They include:\n\nType I - excision of the prepuce, with or without excision of part or all of the clitoris; \nType II - excision of the clitoris with partial or total excision of the labia minora; \nType III - excision of part or all of the external genitalia and stitching/narrowing of the vaginal opening (infibulation); \nType IV - pricking, piercing or incising of the clitoris and/or labia; stretching of the clitoris and/or labia; cauterization by burning of the clitoris and surrounding tissue; \nscraping of tissue surrounding the vaginal orifice (angurya cuts) or cutting of the vagina (gishiri cuts); \nintroduction of corrosive substances or herbs into the vagina to cause bleeding or for the purpose of tightening or narrowing it; and any other procedure that falls under the definition given above. \nThe most common type of female genital mutilation is excision of the clitoris and the labia minora, accounting for up to 80% of all cases; the most extreme form is infibulation, which constitutes about 15% of all procedures.\n\nHealth consequences of FGM\n\nThe immediate and long-term health consequences of female genital mutilation vary according to the type and severity of the procedure performed.\n\nImmediate complications include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, urine retention, ulceration of the genital region and injury to adjacent tissue. Haemorrhage and infection can cause death.\n\nMore recently, concern has arisen about possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) due to the use of one instrument in multiple operations, but this has not been the subject of detailed research.\n\nLong-term consequences include cysts and abscesses, keloid scar formation, damage to the urethra resulting in urinary incontinence, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) and sexual dysfunction and difficulties with childbirth.\n\nPsychosexual and psychological health: Genital mutilation may leave a lasting mark on the life and mind of the woman who has undergone it. In the longer term, women may suffer feelings of incompleteness, anxiety and depression.\n\nWho performs FGM, at what age and for what reasons?\n\nIn cultures where it is an accepted norm, female genital mutilation is practiced by followers of all religious beliefs as well as animists and non believers. FGM is usually performed by a traditional practitioner with crude instruments and without anaesthetic. Among the more affluent in society it may be performed in a health care facility by qualified health personnel. WHO is opposed to medicalization of all the types of female genital mutilation.\n\nThe age at which female genital mutilation is performed varies from area to area. It is performed on infants a few days old, female children and adolescents and, occasionally, on mature women.\n\nThe reasons given by families for having FGM performed include:\n\npsychos

"MLA style, or MLA format, are terms commonly used to describe the guidelines for writing which are developed, maintained, and periodically updated and issued by the Modern Language Association of America (MLA).\n\nThe Modern Language Association of America was founded in 1883 as a forum for scholars to share their ideas, experiences, and findings with counterparts in their respective fields. Since it was founded, the MLA has grown to more than 30,000 members from over 100 countries.\n\nAmong MLA’s many activities over the years, has been the development of standards and guidelines for the uniform writing of academic documents developed by its members. These MLA style guidelines are now the standard used by hundreds of thousands of students and scholars worldwide for the preparation of manuscripts and research papers in English and the Humanities.\n\n\n\nThe MLA documentation style covers all aspects of scholarly writing, beginning with the mechanics of writing and publishing, through the basics of writing style, to guidelines for the preparation of theses and dissertations. Although the MLA guidelines cover all aspects of writing and publishing a paper, MLA documentation style places special emphasis on the proper citing of sources of information in one’s written work, and how to properly and consistently cite them throughout a paper or manuscript.\n\n\nA key feature that differentiates MLA style from other major style conventions is that it recommends that the citation of works (sources) be listed “in-context” within the text of a paper, rather than in page footnotes or chapter/document endnotes.\n\n\nBasic MLA Rules – Paper Format and Citations\nThe publications mentioned above cover literally thousands of technical details for the writing and publishing of papers, and should be consulted if that level of detail is required. Nevertheless, there are a number of overall general guidelines, which are normally sufficient for the preparation of most papers at the undergraduate level:\n\n\nOverall Paper Format - MLA\n\n\nThe paper should be typed and double-spaced, on standard 8 ½” x 11”, 20-pound white paper.\n\n\n\nAll four outside margins should be set at 1 inch.\n\n\n\nA header with consecutive page numbering should appear on the upper right-hand corner of each page. It must be flush with the right margin, and one-half inch down from the top margin.\n\n\n\nA title page is not necessary (unless otherwise requested). Instead of the title page, four double-spaced entries are made, beginning at the top left-hand corner of the first page, listing author (your) name, course instructor’s name, course name/number, and the date.\n\n\n\nThe title of the paper should be centered, one double-space from the bottom of the previous entry (either the header, or the date if there was no title page).\n\n\nIn-Text Citations of Sources - MLA\n\nWhen citing a work within the text of a paper, try to mention the material being cited in a “signal phrase” that includes the author’s name. After that phrase, insert in brackets, the page number in the work referred to from which the information is drawn.\n\n\n\nIn cases where the author is not mentioned in a ""signal phrase"" the author’s name, followed by the page number, must appear in parentheses. \n\nWorks Cited List - MLA\n\nSources are referred to in a ""Works Cited"" list that should begin at the top of a separate page after the last page of essay text. (do not capitalize, underline, etc.).\n\n\n\nAll entries in the works cited list should be double-spaced with no extra line spaces between entries.\n\n\n\nThe first line of each entry in the works cited listshould be flush to the left margin, and each subsequent line for that entryshould be indented one-half inch (i.e. hanging indent).\n\n\n\nFor the title of the work being cited, use underliningor italics, not both. They are equivalent in this case. Whichever convention ischosen must be used throughout the "

It can be achieved using images drawn on a cel, paper or other medium, with clay figures or papers puppets or using computer generated images.\n\nAnimation Industry \n\nA recent study conducted by Anderson Consulting states that the Indian animation industry currently pegged at $550 million is slated to clock a growth rate of 30% annually in the next 3 years. In the next three years India would receive more than $2 billion worth animation business, according to the study. If you are a technology savvy artist looking for an exciting working life then this is good news. Meanwhile, Nasscom estimates the current global animation market to be worth around $45 bn and expects it to jump to between $50 bn and $70 bn by next year. It also states that India could use 300,000 professionals in content development and animation by 2008, up from 27,000 three years ago.

It uses the fingers on the right hand to count ones, and the left hand to count tens.  \n\nIt works like this- hold your hands out just above the table or desk top with your fingers straight out.  To count 1, put down your index finger on your right hand.  2 - add your middle finger, 3 - add ring finger, 4 add pinky.  you have 4 fingers down, and your thumb still up, right?  now the tricky part - to count 5, put down your thumb and lift up all the other fingers.  6 - add your index finger (thumb = 5, plus one finger = 6), 7 - add your middle, and so on. \n\nNow, when you reach 10, you move to your left hand.  The index finger on your left hand is 10.  When you put it down, raise all the fingers on your right hand.  Now to get from 10 to twenty, you just go through the same on your right hand as you did for 1 through 10.\nThe left middle finger is 20, ring is 30, pinky is 40, and the thumb is 50.  \n\nYou can only go from 1 to 100, but it makes adding and subtracting pretty fast.

Rwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\nDespite efforts by Rwanda’s new government, the United Nations (UN), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Rwanda’s recovery from genocide has been slow and far from steady. At a December 1997 press conference, United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed that the United States and Rwanda “must account for the past in order to forge a more just future.” In the following article, written for Encarta Yearbook, author Gérard Prunier explains why this may be difficult to accomplish.\n\n\nRwanda's Struggle to Recover from Genocide\n\nBy Gérard Prunier\n\n\nOne of the 20th century's worst atrocities—the brutal slaughter of approximately 800,000 people in the East African nation of Rwanda in 1994—still demands an accounting.\n\n\nThree years after the genocide ended, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), created by the United Nations (UN), has yet to bring a war criminal to justice. In contrast, the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), established in 1993 to try war crimes committed during the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, has proceeded relatively smoothly. The ICTY reached its first conviction in May 1997. The ICTR's lack of progress has led many Rwandans to believe that the outside world is more concerned about “ethnic cleansing” in Europe than about mass atrocities in east central Africa.\n\n\nOn April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down by unknown assailants as his plane approached the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Habyarimana's death triggered a chain of events in which neighbor turned on neighbor and friend upon friend. Murders occurred within families as ethnic Hutu killed their ethnic Tutsi relatives. Many Hutu priests refused asylum to Tutsi fugitives, and some Hutu schoolteachers actually murdered their Tutsi students. Although the violence appeared spontaneous, it was in fact planned. Many reports in Western news media inaccurately described what was happening as a tribal conflict. The true causes lay elsewhere.\n\nRoots of the Conflict\n\n\nThe conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi in east central Africa was not new. Nor was it the product of ancient tribal hatreds as was so often reported. The Hutu and Tutsi are not tribes. A tribe is a distinct community with its own language, customs, territory, and religion. Hutu and Tutsi in the nations of Rwanda and Burundi share the same territory, speak the same languages (Kinyarwanda in Rwanda, Kirundi in Burundi), share the same customs, practice the same religion, and frequently intermarry. The real difference between the majority Hutu (who make up between 80 and 85 percent of the population in Rwanda and Burundi) and the minority Tutsi (between 12 and 15 percent in both countries) is sociopolitical.\n\n\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of the area now known as Rwanda were the Twa. Rwanda's Hutu migrated to the region later and were well established by the time the Tutsi arrived in the 1400s. This early precolonial society was hierarchical, with Tutsi serving as the ruling aristocracy. Their status was linked to the ownership of cattle, a symbol of social distinction in many East African societies.\n\n\nHutus were not allowed to own cattle unless the cattle were given to them by a Tutsi overlord. The granting of cattle, a ceremonial process called ubuhake in Kinyarwanda, was an essential link between Tutsi social patrons and their Hutu clients. For example, Hutu soldiers who served their Tutsi masters well in war were often rewarded with cattle.\n\n\nWars in the region were frequent, but they did not pit Tutsi against Hutu. Rather, they were civil conflicts between high lineage Tutsis who were supported by their Hutu retainers in a system similar to that of medieval Europe. Or they were wars between the kingdom of Rwanda and the neighboring kingdoms of Iweju, Mpororo, Nkore, or Buha, which toda

So that made me had to stay back another semester.

Walk them through the procedures for how class should begin, how papers should be turned in, how to work independently, how to ask questions.  Quiz your students on this introductory unit on class rules and procedures.  By the end of the first week of school, students should have signed their ""contract"" for behavior that they collabortively drew up with your guidance.\n\nBeyond that, make sure they get the ""big picture"".  They need to understand that education is a two-way street.  They are a responsible for their education as you are.  They need to understand that without their cooperation in following class rules and procedures, you cannot be an effective teacher.  In order for teachers to teach, students must be willing to learn.  Never settle for behavior that does not meet your expectations.  Make students accountable for their behavior and the thoughts behind it."

Ocean surface waves are surface waves which occur at the surface of an ocean. They are mechanical waves that propagate along the interface between water and air; the restoring force is provided by gravity, and so they are often referred to as surface gravity waves. As the wind blows, pressure and friction forces perturb the equilibrium of the ocean surface. These forces transfer energy from the air to the water, forming waves. In the case of monochromatic linear plane waves in deep water, particles near the surface move in circular paths, making ocean surface waves a combination of longitudinal (back and forth) and transverse (up and down) wave motions. When waves propagate in shallow water, (where the depth is less than half the wavelength) the particle trajectories are compressed into ellipses. As the wave amplitude (height) increases, the particle paths no longer form closed orbits; rather, after the passage of each crest, particles are displaced a little forward from their previous positions, a phenomenon known as Stokes drift. A good illustration of the wave motion is given by *Prof. Robert Dalrymple Java applet.
If you are going away to school the first thing you are going to realize is, there are no direct requirements on your day other than about 3 or 4 hours that you may be in class on the high side. You can sleep as much as you want, eat as much as you want, drink as much as you want you get the idea. If you want to play video games for 20 hours a day, fire up the computer and go at it. \n\nIt will probably take a semester or two to really figure out the best way to be efficent in your studying while getting the best results. I have met very few people who have no time to do what it is they want to do, and these people only have such frentic schedules because they realize they need to take more time on their studies for whatever reason. \n\nTrust me you will have plenty of time to do nothing if you want to.

Well its just a case of a stigma dying very slowly. You could probably date it back to the victorian period if you wanted to, where people were very prim and proper. It simple has been unacceptable in american society as far as i can think of that you could talk about a sexual activity such as masterbation. For a while this was because of a lack of information and the church influence. An act traditionally only involving one person, which is stigmatized as sinful (since most people are looking at pornography while doing it) leads to not a lot of talk about the issue. I think you find its becoming more socially acceptable but its not at yet to the degree of talking openly about sex, and it probably wont catch up anytime soon as its still a primarly solitary act.
The first rule when responding to an RFP is to read it completely and thoroughly and make sure you answer every question the way they want and include all the documentation and supporting letters they need.\n\nBasically, is you don't follow the rules, you will immediately be eliminated  without further consideration.\n\nAs for winning a grant, well, they are competitive.  You simply have to be better than all the rest.  Propose a higher level of services at a lower cost and you should win.\n\nAs for hiring a grant writer, that is a great idea, but there aren't many good, competent grant writers out there, and they are very expensive.  Also, chances are any good grant writer has several other clients competing for the same grants and this, I feel, creates a conflict of interest for them.  We always try to keep it in-house.\n\nFinal note: If possible, hand deliver the proposal and get a time stamped receipt.  Otherwise, send it at least a few days before the deadline via FedEx, or some other carrier that offers proof of delivery.

An associates degree usually takes 1-2 years to obtain.  Often it's two years.  A master's degree takes an additional 2 years beyond a Bachelor's degree (which takes 4 years to obtain).  Basically you could get your master's after you obtain an associates...but that would probably require 4 extra years.  Usually the order is associates (2 years), bachelors (another 2 years beyond the associates), and a masters degree (another 2 years beyond the bachelors degree)  It usually takes about 5-6 years to get a Masters.  An MS is specifically a Master's of Science degree.  Best of luck if you pursue either of those!  I have a bachelor's which took me 4 years to get.  I'd like to go for my Master's which will be another 2 years.  :)  But you can do it!  Best of luck! :D

"Here is a start for you to begin your research:\n\nWhat issues created the sectional conflict?\n\n1. Slavery - first and foremost the most important difference between the north and south was slavery. For the most part most northerners really didn't care about slavery in the beginning but as time went on slavery, the existence of it as well as the extension of slavery into the wetern territories, became the central issue.\n\n2. Representation - The north and south each wanted power to pass laws that would benefit theri section. This meant that the more states that became ""free"" or ""slave"" meant more votes, both in the House, Senate and Electoral College, for that section. The issue of repreenation is played out as we expand westward and decisions must be made about each state.\n\n3. Tariffs - The South resented all tariffs as they relied on British imports for more of their everyday goods. They also needed other nations to purchase cotton form their farms. As the north supported tariffs to protect their growing industries the south became incressingly angered. Thsi tension eventually led to the passage of what South Carolina called ""the Tariff of Abominations."" The south then argued they had the right of nullification. (nullification - the power of a state to declare a federal law null and void.)\n\n4. States Rights - This issue is a direct outgrowth of the South's fear that the North would pass laws that would hurt it's lifestyle. Some examples would be tariffs and laws to restrict or abolish slavery. The south again claimed they had the right of nullification.\n\nThe sites below should answer all of your questions~good luck!"

because there is very little resistance in space. objects in motion will stay in motion unless a force acts on them. since they are in space, there's not really much of a foce acting on them with one exception: gravity.\n\ngravity of course pulls the satellites down towards the earth. but the satellite is moving at a fairly constant velocity in a direction which is tangent to the earth. so the direction of travel is always perpendicular to the force of gravity, which means that the satellite stays in perfect orbit.\n\nif it used its fuel to speed up, it would overcome the earth's gravity and fly off into space. if it used its fuel to slow down, the earth's gravity would overcome the satellites speed and pull it in. orbit is the perfect middle ground between these two.\n\nnow if there were a bunch of air in space, then the air molecules would cause friction that would slow the satellite down. the earth's gravity would then pull it in and cause it to crash. so to overcome the air molecules, the satellite would need a constant thrust to keep it in orbit. but since there is little or no resistance in space, it doesn't need to hit its boosters at all. it just needs to get up to the perfect speed and physics will take care of the rest.\n\nsorry if this was unclear. it's late ;p

"Might help break the ice or cheer you up.  Modify to fit.\n\n\nDear Mother and Dad,\n\nIt has now been three months since I left for college. I have been remiss in writing and I am very sorry for the thoughtlessness in not having written before. I will bring you up-to-date now, but before you read on, please sit down. You are not going to read any further unless you are\nsitting down. Okay?\n\nWell, I am getting along pretty well now. The skull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital, and now I can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches one a day.\n\nFortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump were witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the Fire Department and the ambulance. He also visited me in the hospital and since I had nowhere to live because of the burnt out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment with him. Its really a basement room, but its kind of cute. He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. We haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy begins to show.\n\nYes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you are looking forward to being grandparents and I know you will welcome the baby and give it the same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child. The reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has some minor infection which prevents us from passing the pre-marital blood test and I carelessly caught it from him. This will clear up with the penicillin injections I am now taking daily. I know you will welcome him into the family with open arms. He is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he is of a different race and religion than ours, I know your often expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by the fact that his skin color is somewhat different than ours. I am sure that you will love him as I do. His family background is good too, for I am told that his father is an important engineer for the sanitation department he works for.  Although they say he runs his office from his truck.\n\nNow that I have brought you up-to-date, folks, I want to tell you that there was NO dormitory fire, I did not have a concussion or a skull fracture, I was not in the hospital, I am not pregnant, I am not engaged, I do not have syphilis, and there is no schwartze in my life. However, I am getting a ""D"" in history and an ""F"" in science, and I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.\n\nYour loving daughter, ..."

"Not sure why you care whether it's an ""Ivy"" or not, but generally, Virginia, Michigan, and Berkley are regarded as the best public law schools.

Boston University is highly regarded, especially in Boston, though most people wouldn't call it a ""top"" school.""

"All Quiet on the Western Front was actually and anti-war story.   ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was written in a first person style.  The story was told by Paul Baümer, a nineteen year old student, convinced to enlist with the German army by his schoolmaster, Kantorek.  Along with many of his friends from school, he is trained under Corporal Himmelstoss, a strictly disciplined commander who dislikes Paul because of his ""defiance.""\n    When sent to the front, Paul, along with his other friends, made new friendships that would last throughout time.  His newly made friend/commander, was a man named Stanislaus Katczinsky.  As a man of forty years of age he was an wise old man as well as a friend to the young eighteen and nineteen year old recruits.  \n    After visiting the front for long stretches Paul is given fourteen days of leave where he can visit his ill mother at his own home.  After this leave he is sent back to training and then back to the front.  His trip is lengthened when he discovers that his unit has been reassigned to another area.  Finding his unit, he reunites with his friends and joins up with them again in the war efforts.\n      While searching in ""no man's land,"" Paul is confined to a shell hole for a long night.  During this night a French soldier falls in the hole and Paul stabs him.  The hours to come are very hard for Paul as he comforts and waits for the Frenchman to die.\n    Paul's group has a stroke of luck when they were assigned to defend a village.  Since no inhabitants were left they were able to go through the houses to take and use whatever they wanted.  This luck, however, did not last forever.   One day the French came and began shelling the village.  While evacuating Paul and his friend Albert Kropp were injured by gunshot wounds.  They were bandaged up and sent on a train back home.  \n    This ride home took a turn.  When Kropp got a fever he was scheduled to be dropped off at the next stop.  In order for Paul to stay with his friend, he had to convince the nurse that he also was sick from infection.  After being dropped off they were taken to a Catholic hospital to be treated.  After a few weeks Kropp's leg is overcome with infection and is amputated at the thigh.  After a few more weeks Paul and Kropp parted, Paul going back to the war and Kropp going home.\n    Returning to the front was hard for Paul.  The days were getting cold and one by one he watched his friends die.  The hardest loss was that of Kat.   After Kat had been shot, Paul had to carry Kat to the nearest dressing station a few miles away.  Stopping every few minutes to rest, Paul frequently checked to make sure that Kat, even with his injury, was ok.  When at last Paul reached the dressing station the nurse told him that Kat was dead.  When Paul checked again a small shell fragment had just penetrated that back of Kat's head.  He was still even warm.   Kat was the last of Paul's friends to die in the war.  Then, in October of 1918, Paul finally fell.  The book describes his death as, ""...his face had an expression of calm, as though almost glad the end had come.""  The war ended the next month. \n\nHitler diodn't appreciate the anti-war stance of the book. In the story war is described in horrific detail and it's futility questioned. All the characters die in awful circumstances, the hero Paul literally at the last moment of the war at 11 o'clock on 11th November 1918 just as peace was announced. It is set in World War I where Hitler himself serves as a messenger, although German propoganda later elevated him to the rank of Corporal (as there were no records below sergeant to verify this) and the he had won the Iron Cross, 1st Class, a medal for gallantry. As he never saw action this was pure fabrication. There is also section in the book where the hero Paul shares a hole with a french soldier and makes friends with him. Such fraternisation was no"

Analysis\nThe poem is an attack on the bigotry and hypocrisy of the Kirk (Church), as told by the (fictional) self-justifying prayer of a (real) kirk elder, Holy Willie. Throughout the poem, Holy Willie condemns himself as a hypocrite while simultaneously asking God to judge harshly and show no mercy to his fellow transgressors. Burns used the example of Holy Willie to make the point that the Calvinist theology underpinning the entire Kirk was equally hypocritical.\n\nThe Kirk was still a powerful moral force in Burns' day, and one which he believed he had a justified grievance against. Burns felt that belief in predestination, whether to salvation or damnation, could only make people morally reckless, because logically their actions could have no influence on their eternal fate. He observed that belief in predestination, particularly to salvation, had the additional tendency to make people insufferably self-righteous. It is this last tendency in particular, and the more general theological and moral sterility embodied in the teachings of the contemporary Kirk, that he rails against very effectively in this work.\n\nWillie's soapy sanctimony is alternated with his self-justifying tales of his own fornication and other transgressions with very great skill. The characters are drawn from real life, with no names being changed.\n\nIn The Book of Ebenezer Le Page, 'Holy Willie' is used as a term of abuse for insincere clerics.

"There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships.

"We have to change our understandings of the world around us and our knowledge base throughout our lives as the world and society change and our understanding of them change.  When we start a new job or leave high school for university or get married we have to leave behind some of our old ways and learn new ones.  \n\nActually, ""unlearning"" can be harder than ""learning"".  It is rather like breaking a habit - can be very difficult to do.  It is why once a baby learns that mom or dad will come into his room if he cries when he is put to bed, it takes quite a bit of persistence to break that cycle.\n\nYou have to focus on the ""unlearning"", depending on what the topic is (this would bve easier to answer if we knew what you have to ""unlearn"").  And persistently practice whatever the new behavior or idea or concept needs to be.\n\nThese links may help."

In general, lighter refined petroleum products such as diesel and gasoline are more likely to mix in the water column and are more toxic to marine life, but tend to evaporate relatively quickly and do not persist long in the environment. Heavier crude or fuel oil, while of less immediate toxicity, can remain on the water surface or stranded on the shoreline for much longer. Oil from the Exxon Valdez and Gulf War oil spills, while weathering over time, has persisted along the shoreline for years after the spill.

People with Down syndrome are on a spectrum, just like non-Down syndrome people. There are some really high functioning people with Down, who can live, work and go to school independently, and there are some really low functioning people with Down, who require assistance with all types of daily activities.\n\nYou'd have to consider each person differently, on a case by case basis.
"If you're a nurse now you could teach in nursing school or teach science and math classes in college. Depending on where you teach you could be teaching working adults who are eager to learn and willing to do the work it takes to do well in college. Science and allied health instructors in college are often highly respected and, in the right place, well-compensated.\n\nFor teaching: Do you have a deep or broad practical knowledge of a subject? That will help you prepare the class structure, find the right materials, and prepare your lectures. Do you have a passion for the subject? That helps you explain difficult concepts, answer all kinds of questions from all kinds of students, and to have the energy and stamina to work with students who aren't ""getting it"" right away. Do you remember what it was like when you were a student - what worked in class and what didn't? That will help you create the best possible class for the subject. To teach you should like public speaking and be fairly good at it. With teaching you need to be able to see the big picture and the small details. Just like nursing. \n\nOf course the other thing they have in common is helping people, but in teaching you have far more time to work with individuals as they progress, you have an opportunity to experiment with various techniques and resources, and you're usually not under pressure to make immediate, life-or-death decisions. Teaching can be incredibly rewarding - when you make a lasting impression on a student you can be sure that what you have taught will be carried far and wide in the ripple effects."

Maldives\nI  INTRODUCTION \n\nMaldives (Diveti Rajje ge Jumhuriyya), island republic in southern Asia, located in the northern Indian Ocean, south-west of the southern tip of India. The Maldives is made up of a chain of nearly 2,000 small coral islands that are grouped into clusters of atolls. It has a total land area of 298 sq km (115 sq mi). The capital and largest city of the Maldives is Malé.\n\nII  LAND AND RESOURCES \n\nThe islands are low-lying and have only small tracts of arable land. Vegetation is dominated by coconut palms and breadfruit trees. The principal natural resource is the marine life of the surrounding seas. \n\nA  Climate \n\nThe climate is tropical and humid. The average annual temperature is 26.7° C (80° F), with little seasonal variation. The average annual precipitation is 1,524 mm (60 in), most of which falls between May and November.\n\nB  Environmental Concerns \n\nWith 80 per cent of the nation less than 1 metre (40 in) above sea level, the problem of global warming and resultant rising sea levels is a growing concern in the Maldives. The devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that hit the islands on December 26, 2004, flooded large areas of the islands. Significant population growth has led to overfishing around the islands, and the natural supply of fresh water is nearly exhausted.\n\nIII  POPULATION \n\nThe Maldives has a population of 339,330 (2004 estimate), yielding an average population density of 1,131 people per sq km (2,930 per sq mi). The most populous atolls are Malé, the capital and principal commercial centre, with a population of 84,000 (2001 estimate); Suvadiva; and Tiladummati. There are 20 political divisions based on the atolls: Alifu, Baa, Dhaalu, Faafu, Gaafu Alifu, Gaafu Dhaalu, Gnaviyani, Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Kaafu, Laamu, Lhaviyani, Malé, Meemu, Noonu, Raa, Seenu, Shaviyani, Thaa, and Vaavu. The people are ethnically heterogeneous, incorporating Indian, Sinhalese, Arabian, and African elements. Life expectancy in 2004 was 62 years for men and 65 years for women.\n\nA  Religion \n\nIslam is the state religion; nearly all the people are Sunni Muslims.\n\nB  Language \n\nThe language is Divehi (Maldivian), an Indo-European tongue related to Sinhalese.\n\nC  Culture \n\nDivehi culture predominates and the best-known music-and-dance form is the bodu beru (Divehi; “big drum”). Participants include a lead singer and drummers as well as other percussionists and the tempo of the music and dance rise to a frenzied crescendo. Another form of dance, performed by women, is the bandiyaa jehun. The rhythm is tapped out on water pots. There is a National Museum of local exhibits at Malé.\n\nIV  ECONOMY \n\nThe Maldivian economy is dominated by fishing and fish products, which accounted for almost 85 per cent of all export trade in 1993, and tourism. The fish catch is primarily tuna; corals and shells are also harvested. Coconuts are the principal agricultural product; most food must be imported. Industrial activity is largely limited to fish-processing and garment-manufacturing.\n\nA  Tourism \n\nThe rapid growth of the tourist industry has necessitated improvements in the infrastructure of the country, such as the installation of telephones and other forms of communication. Tourism is the principal foreign currency earner for the Maldives, with approximately 485,000 tourist arrivals recorded in 2002. Earnings from tourism totalled US$38 million in 1997. Malé International Airport is the major point of arrival for tourists.\n\nB  Currency and Banking \n\nThe monetary unit of the Maldives is the rufiyaa, made up of 100 laari (12.69 rufiyaa equalled US$1; early 2004). Currency is issued by the Maldives Monetary Authority.\n\nV  GOVERNMENT \n\nThe Maldives is a republic governed under a constitution promulgated in 1968 and revised in 1997, with effect from 1998. The president is both chief of state and head of government and is elected every five years by the parliamentary assembly and

"Mine happened in Jr. High. I was talking to the girl behind me and the teacher called me up to his desk. He said that for talking I was to get paddled. (Then it was allowed.) He gave me one wack, and then asked the kids in the back of the class if they heard it. When they said ""No"", he gave me another wack. He asked if they heard that one, and the answer again was ""No"". So he gave me a third wack, only harder. When the back of the class said that they  heard that one, he stopped. I told my mother what happened,and she said that I should not have been talking in class."

There are wide range of circuit breaker equipment, both MCB and MCCB(Molded Case Circuit Breaker). The range of MCB boards are highly durable and allow the installer maximum flexibility.\nThere is a huge number of variations with Current ratings from 6 Amps to 40 Amps. \nDifferent series including High rupture capacity, Single to four Pole. \nHigh breaking capacity: 20 - 15 - 10 - 6 K A Nominal rated currents from 0.5 to 63 A Wide range of the executions for both the MCBs and the accessories combined main contacts. \n\nThe traditional molded-case circuit breaker uses electromechanical (thermal magnetic) trip units that may be fixed or interchangeable. An MCCB provides protection by combining a temperature sensitive device with a current sensitive electromagnetic device. Both these devices act mechanically on the trip mechanism.\n\nDepending upon the application and required protection, an MCCB will use one or a combination of different trip elements that protect against the following conditions:\n\nThermal overloads; Short circuits; and Ground faults.

Allow me to put my feet in the sandals of a Neanderthal for a moment. Life is very difficult, but there are some comforts because we make tools, weapons and shelters and have the knowledge to use fire. Fire, water, and wild game are key to our survival. We don't live very different from the American Indians when they were discovered in the 1400's, 600 years ago. We are basically in the Stone Age.\nNow I'll put myself in the boots of a modern camper. When I'm in the open country and hear the wild animals it takes me back to my genetic roots and gives me a wonderful feeling of peace and a sense of dangerous adventure.
Its about the Gift of life\n\nThe dictionary says that gift is “something voluntarily transferred by one person to another without compensation.” It also says “a notable capacity.” Zen teachers suggest that the miracle isn’t to be able to walk on air or water. Rather, the miracle is to simply walk on the earth. How often we overlook what is directly underfoot by trying to see what is out of view and considered by some to be higher or greater! Our everyday situation is the gift we are given. Are we able to hold it gently, thankfully, and peacefully? Even if our everyday situation doesn’t look like what we think it should look like?

An actual study of two European Swallows flying in a low-turbulence wind tunnel in Lund, Sweden, shows that swallows flap their wings much slower than my estimate, at only 7–9 beats per second:\n\n    “Compared with other species of similar size, the swallow has quite low wingbeat frequency and relatively long wings.” 7 \n\nThe maximum speed the birds could maintain was 13–14 meters per second, and although the Lund study does not discuss cruising flight in particular, the most efficient flapping (7 beats per second) occurred at an airspeed in the range of 8–11 meters per second, with an amplitude of 90–100° (17–19 cm).

Websites? I don't know. It never is that great an idea to do research at the last minute (though it happens). If your paper is not due tomorrow then you should visit the library tomorrow and check out the National Geographic collection. You'll be sure to find some helpful stuff there. A lot of libraries have websites though. Check your local library website and see if they have a 'research' link. You'll need your library card for it though, so they can verify you're a resident of library district. Perhaps the website for the Monterray Aquarium (in california) would have some info too. Or maybe the aquarium in Seward Alaska. They probably have websites too.

Final exams are used to determine your level of proficency on a given subject, what information you retain and in many cases, your ability to master a subject in a meaningful way. In other words, not just the ability to memeorize facts and figures, but take knowledge and apply it. \n\nYes, they can be difficult. But it seems to me that most kids today are more afraid to exercise their brains than they are to run their mouths....Gaining knowledge is it's own reward and better to learn now than when you're old an it's too late...

"here is the answer from homeschool.com\n\nA: The short answer to this, as kids today are likely to say is, ""24-7."" Again, think in terms of being free from the way government schools go about educating children. If you like schedules, stick with theirs. But realize that an evening trip to the grocery store, a weekend visit to the nature center, and even bedtime story hour are times available for learning together.\n\nSome families sit down and do all their academic (book) work for a couple of hours each morning, freeing up the children's afternoons for personal pursuits. Others scatter book work throughout the day, or note that their children might sit down with a math book for 2 weeks straight, then not touch it again for a month. Sometimes families simply go through the course of a day and only take advantage of ""teachable moments"" as they arise.\n\nAs you begin to homeschool, and if you just observe what takes place in the course of a week or so, you'll begin to notice a ""rhythm"" - your family's personal rhythm. Here's where you'll get your best clues as to the best times for particular pursuits. Just one word of warning: When I did this, I saw that two of my children were night owls! Just about the time my mind and body were winding down, they were just getting into gear! This was definitely an impetus to help them become independent learners very quickly!\n\n\nhere is my answer:  spend about 2 focused hours learning between breakfast and lunch, and let them follow thier own pursuits in the afternoon.\n\nthe answer for your child;  try out different things.. the answer for your kid may be different than mine."

I did Princeton Review twice (never take the MCAT unless you're actually going to apply -- scores expire in two years). I like Princeton Review because they offered more classroom time than Kaplan. I don't like too much independent study, so Kaplan was not a good choice for me.\n\nIf you *do* prefer to study alone, then Kaplan is ideal. They give you a lot of practice problems, and offer a lot of online study materials. But if you want time with instructors, and time to study in groups, then do Princeton Review.\n\nAlso, PR is about $100 cheaper than Kaplan.

It depnds on your contract or terms under which you were engaged.
Ignore the insulting answers. The reason you have difficulty with English is because in England we have very strong regional accents and even English people have difficulty understanding each other sometimes. The strongest accents are those in London (Cockney), Birmingham (Black Country). North East (Geordie). Devon and Cornwall (West Country), Liverpool (Scouse) and North (Lancashire and Yorkshire). For example in London the word 'Face' might sound like 'Fice', in Birmingham 'Time' will sound like 'toime' and 'tea' will sound like 'toy'. In Liverpool 'work' will sound like 'werk'. In the North East 'go down there' will come out as 'gan dan yan'. In the West Country 'I like that' would sound like 'Oi loike tha'. In Lancashire and Yorkshire the accent is very flat and letters left out so 'where are you going?' would come out as 'wer yer goin?'. Also lots of people now don't pronounce their words correctly, the most irritating example being the dropping of the letter 't' from words such as 'party' which sounds like 'par'y'. Also in some parts of the country they speak so that when they finish their sentences they use an upward inflection, like the Aussies, so that the sentence sounds almost like a question.\n\nBy the way I've visited Holland and it's a beautiful place. I enjoyed my stay there immensely and Amsterdam is a great city. The people there seemed to speak English better than most English people.

Also, I don't think I'd use a paccer for drawing if you're trying to go for the pencil look.\n\nOther than that, I'd say it really is your preference.

Actually, that's not true.  The ACT and SAT are given equal weight when applying for college - it does not matter which one you take.  From my personal experience - and from all the college students' applications I've seen over the years - if you're better at science and math, you will usually score slightly higher on the ACT as opposed to the SAT.  If you're more into liberal arts, you will generally score slightly higher on the SAT.  I personally scored a 1280 on the SAT and 30 on the ACT.  A 30 ACT translates to approximately 1340 SAT, and I got a degree in Math, so I guess that proves my point.
Why?  Your teacher's personal life is none of your business, unless as previous posters indicated your teacher  is making passes at you.  Then you wouild tell and it wouldn't matter whether the teacher is gay or straight or whatever.  It would be the making passes at a student that would be the problem, not the teacher's sexual orientation.
It depends on what you can make work for you. I was lucky--I got a four year scholarship and help from my parents.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n* FAFSA\n* Scholarships\n* Student Loans\n* Parents\n* Savings\n* Part-Time Job\n* Work as R.A. for free room and board\n* Take college seriously so you aren't wasting the money\n* G.I. Bill\n* Special programs. Example: In NC, there is a program where you can go to college for free if you promise to teach in NC for four years after graduating.

Take the grade in each class and find its gpa\nA = 4.0\nB+ = 3.5\nB = 3.0\nC+ = 2.5\nC = 2.0\nD = 1.0\nThen multiply that number by the credit hours.\n\n3 credits of an A would be 4 x 3 = 12.\n\nDo this for each class you have taken and then add up the points.  Then divide the points you have by the total number of credits.

The shapes of cars has changed to allow them to become more aerodynamic, which in turn allows them to use less gas because they can move through the air easier, thereby saving gas. The shape of the car also attracts consumers because the curves remind them of futuristic cars of the future from science fiction movies. The wind tunnel effect is simply how much air resistance the body of a car has.

Yes, I do think he's going to hell. He violated the first commandment amoung other things. He said God appointed him as president, thats the kind of attitude our forefathers fought against and created this country. He's stolen from the American people, another commandment, he's lied, and accused others unjustly-another commandment. He says saddam should be prosecuted because he committed crimes against humanity? I think Bush should be prosecuted for the same thing! We went after hussien because he was easier to capture, and Bush had a personal vendetta against the Iraqui dictator. All he cares about are the rich, and could care less about the poor. He makes generalities that only the rich could live up to. The poor don't have money, how are they supposed live? The rich have money, and money makes George Bush's world go around. He said the proudest moment in his presidency was when he caught a fish! A FISH! Can u believe it? Ok, I could blab on forever, so I'll stop, u got my answer.

the profile of a Graphic designer:-\nThis job involves creating all sorts and types of artwork. Classic examples would be a new logo for a company, or perhaps a web site, art work for media campaigns, whether print, film or online.\nYou will need a superb command of computer software in the field these days where most design takes place.\nThe key skill is an artist eye and creativity, to respond to briefs in a suitable manner.\nYou need to create visually attractive imagery, and be able to communicate and absorb ideas clearly and easily. Good client skills are a must.\nSoftware includes Photoshop, QuarkExpress and other tools.\nMany work on a freelance basis, and therefore a portfolio is key. Consider offering cheaper prices to get your first few clients.\nUnderstanding the client is key - for instance if it is a cute, small company it may want a more intimate friendly logo than a corporate which may prefer a simple, one or two colour logo.\nThere is reasonable competition but plenty of work out there on offer. No degree is needed, though many do enter the field from doing an art related or even graphic design course or degree.
Well, traveling in the Beagle ship was one for sure. Before that he was already an evolutionist (closer to Lamark) but he figured out natural selection only after comparing varieties of the same species on nearby islands and finding out some islands had species that where absent in others close by. Until then he had worked mostly with domestic animals and breeders. Reading Malthus' essay on population also helped.\nThe second I would say was finding out that someone else (I don't recall the name just now) was working in the same line as he was, that is, on the idea of natural selection. Only then did he sit down and write On the Origin of Species, long after his return from sea.

In Chapter 11 The dwarves find the secret door to the dragon's den because they hear a thrush knocking (that is a type of bird) and it makes them look over at a hole in a rock that is shaped like a keyhole and the setting sun shines through the keyhole and casts light onto the secret door.\n\nThe treasure that Bilbo takes from the dragon's den is a goblet. I don't remember exactly why and as for the last question I'm not really sure what the weak point is in the dwarves plan.\n\nMaybe you should go back and reread those chapters since you know where the answers can be found.

Perhaps instead of discounting the degrees entirely, they should take a look at the institution it was granted from. In addition I do not see why an entry exam should not be administered by any employer (In UK for foreign applicants, and vice versa) to ensure that employees actually have the understanding required to adequately do their job. It should really  depend on the position in question- a professional or highly skilled position should be scrutinized no matter in what country. An entry level position should allow easy access within reason. If the degrees were discounted, there definitely should at the very least be an equivalency testing procedure to translate a degree earned in one place into a comparable degree in another.
I was shy as hell... what helped me get over it is just throwing myself into a situtation where I was forced to confront my fears. For example. I took a speech class in high school where about once a week we had do give a speech in front of the class. Also I volunteered at a nursing home... that doesn't force you to talk infront of a large group but it makes you talk to people from all walks of life. It makes you get used to talking to different people and strangers. Plus with my job that I have now (receptionist) I have to talk to A LOT of people and have to at least act like a people person. I say just throw yourself in their and all will get easier after a few times.\nPractice makes perfect.

"Very solid advice from the poster above; a lot varies by what you want to study.  The UCAS route is definitely the first step to identifying where you could go with those grades.\n\nNext, is more important, though.  Go and SEE the places; go to as many open days and events as you can, and go and visit towns that you're interested in on non-event days too.  It's far more important to go to a university where you're going to be comfortable and happy than to go to one which is slightly ""better"" officially, so make sure you take time and find somewhere you like and will be happy (and hence work well) at."
"Have excellent credentials, make sure the application sells brand ""you"", and when you write open-ended responses (i.e., the essays) be descriptive, original, and purposeful...don't repeat the information they can read elsewhere.\n\nWhen applying to colleges by all means send applications to Ivy League schools, but also have fallbacks.  And the fallback schools aren't necessarily bad.  If you're considering Ivy League to mean ""A level,"" if you get into what you'd deem a ""B level"" school you can usually transfer after 1 or 2 years.  Also, you might consider staying your entire undergraduate career at a ""B level"" school and aim to excel.  Chances are, you'll need professional (e.g., law or business school) or graduate training.  This is where you shoot for the Ivy Leagues, and you'll have a collegiate record and more specific tests (GRE, LSAT, etc.) for schools to consider."
It's in Hyde Park, New York, along the Hudson River. The best culinary school in the nation. Some of the top New York City Chefs went there. As well as throughout the country. Unfortunately, the institute is not as good as it was back in the 1970s. Then most of the instructors were French. And if you don't know, the French are the leading culinary chefs in the world. That's why if you go to a top restaurant in Paris, expect to pay five hundred dollars for a dinner for two. One could stayed seated, however, as long as they like without being rushed out.

"Especially in higher institutions, the pressure to do well is HUGE (i'm at an ivy, and the competition is ridiculous).  I'd say just be there for your son, say that you're proud of him no matter what his grades are.  Also, perhaps try to put things in perspective for him.  such as ""what do you think would happen if you weren't number 2?""  No one can be the best.  They can just do the best they can, be happy with what they accomplish, and learn and grow from every experience they have.  Also, suggest doing some sort of physical activities, that can ease a lot of stress, and put people in really good moods.  Eating well at school is very important too, to be awake and alert.  School can be very stressful, but just try to help your son realize that there are other things to enjoy in college, so much of it is about the social lessons you learn, too\n\nGood luck!"

"Mosquitoes actually use CO2 to home in on a warm blood source.  Once close enough they go for the radiant heat.  Lucky for them or unlucky for us mammals and particularly human mammals are usually the highest producers of both CO2 and radiant heat in the areas we live.\n\nI and most I know have found ""skin so soft"" to be the most effective way to repel the mosquitoes.\n\nThe best way to deal with this problem now is much simpler if you normally use your back yard say for a party.  There is a mosquito catcher that uses propane gas with a small flame to spread CO2 gas, the burner is quite large and surface temperature is just above the normal radiated temperature of humans so the mosquitoes that do live in your area are attracted to it and the little fan sucks them into a bag.\n\nAfter several uses (days in a row) you will have collected most of the mosquitoes in range of your back yard and things can be so pleasant."

1. Through some re-working of the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, you can get M = (dRT)/P where M is the molecular mass, d is the density, and R is the gas constant, 0.08206. Plug in your values, minding tempurature must be in K and solve for d. I got 3.9, rounding give 4 g/L or b.\n\n---------------\n\n2.First you have to balance the combustion reaction CO + O2 => CO2. So you'd have a 1/2 in front of the O2, and that should be it. Then you just convert 22 grams of CO2 into moles of CO2 and use the balanced reaction coefficients to see how many moles of O2 you will need (i.e. divide the number of CO2 moles by 2 to get O2 moles) thenjust plug everything into PV = nRT again and solve for V. I got 5.6 L or b.\n\n---------------\n\n3. Although there are alot of ways to do this, the way I do it is like this. R1/R2 = SQRT(M2/M1) where R is the speed of each molecule in question and M is the molecular mass. Notice how the order changes on each side of the equation - this is not a mistake. so you just plug everything in and solve for R2 (or R1 depending on how you set it up). I got 2.5 E 4 or a. Also, just in case, SQRT means Square Root.

"Depending on the school, you may just need to take one math class (usually called something like Math for Lib Ed majors).  It encompasses the basics of several different types of math.  However, depending on how far you want to go in Psychology, they may also have you take a Statistics class.  In fact, if you can, I would advise taking the Statistics class over the Lib Ed Math class - the Statistics class could provide you with some useful information that you may actually use later in life, but it's generally thought of as being a little harder.  Most people I know, though, struggle with advanced math because they see the problem and think ""how on earth is doing this problem going to help me later in life?""  It's hard to work up the motivation to learn something if you can't see the point in learning it, right?  Well, while you may not ever use the Pythagoream Theorem again after Lib Ed Math, many of the concepts in Statistcs can be applied to situations you run into every day.  Good luck!"

"This poor little guy! I've been teaching preschool for 12 years and have met some very angry children. They can be very frustrating and hurtful. When I have a child like this, I take a look at my reaction (and my coworker) to them. I find that if we are feeling frustrated, angry, stressed, they act worse. \n\nThe child feels that the teachers don't like him. He probably feels this way at home. He gets attention when he is naughty and continues. Try and have your staff be positive with this child as much as possible. Say things like ""You did that by yourself!"" ""Look how high you climbed!"" ""You used so many colors on your picture!"" These are great phrases for building confidence. Smile a lot when he is behaving.\n\nI don't use time out in my classroom. Time out causes resentment, is shaming, and the child can become very angry because you are controlling them. Instead of using time out when he is misbehaving, get down to his level and say ""I would like you to (Calm down, listen...)."" Take him gently to and area away form the others and say ""When you're ready to (calm down, listen...) then you can come back with us."" This is not a time out because you are not setting a time limit. He returns when he's ready to control himself. Be consistent and patient. It will take some time.\n\nAlso, try and use natural and logical consequences whenever possible. If he spits, take him to the toilet and say ""If you need to spit, you can spit here. When you are ready to stop spitting you can come back."" If he hurts, focus all of you attention on the hurt child, empathize A LOT, and shut him out. He will not like feeling ignored. The hurt child should also tell him ""I don't like when you hit me. I do want to play with you if you are going to hurt me!""  It is a very powerful message coming form another child. When he makes a mess, he cleans it before he can move on to something else. \n\nEmpathize with him a lot. ""I can tell you were really angry, frustrated, upset, hurt, mad..."" He will begin to use words to express himsef. \n\nDo everything you can to keep this child. It would be horrible for him to get kicked out of another school. I know my suggestions take some effort and time, but I have been in similar situations and this technique has worked. Good luck!"
A bibliographic page is where you list the sources for your proceeding paper.  Many teachers have different formats that they wish their students to use, so make sure you ask your teacher/look at the assignment.  Below is a link to a format used by the Palo Alto Middle School Libraries which is pretty standard form for most bibliographies through the high school level.  Certain disciplines, such as psychology, have their own bibliographic format, however these are often not required until the collegiate level.

It is an old superstition, that when you make a statement, and then worry that, by having made the statement you've somehow jinxed it, you say 'touch wood'. \n\nEg, I think I've got the job, touch wood.\n\nOr, 'I think I did alright in that exam, touch wood!'\n\nThen, you should look around for a bit of wood to actually touch, to cement this!

"There are four things that make English Germanic.\n\n1)  It's sound system is clearly derived from Proto-Germanic through regular sound changes.  For example, English hound, German Hund (h:h, n:n, d:t); English tide, German Zeit (t:ts; d:t); etc.\n\n2)  It's basic vocabulary is clearly Germanic.  For example, (English/German) come/kommen; foot/fuss; five/fünf; etc.\n\n3)  It's grammar is clearly Germanic.  For example, Early Modern English come/comest/cometh, German komme/kommst/kommt; English ""i have made"", German ""ich habe gemacht"" (same perfect construction)\n\n4)  It's irregularities are the same irregularities found in the other Germanic languages.  For example, English bind/bound, German binden/bund (strong verbs); English man/men, German Mann/Männer (vowel change for plural)\n\nEnglish is absolutely, 100% a Germanic language through regular sound correspondences, the majority of its basic vocabulary, the majority of its grammatical structures, and the same patterns of irregularity"
if u have to LISTEN to it, get somebody (a sibling, a best friend, ur boyfriend or even ur mom) to study with u... or record urself reading the material, and listen to it!\n\nstudying with somebody always helps, seriously, for various reasons:\n\n1. the motivation - u appreciate that this person is taking time out to help u and u wanna be cooperative by NOT wasting their time.\n\n2. the visual & audio effects - if that person is explaining something to u, its more likely to stick bcuz of the examples they give from personal experience, or the joke they make, or the coffee that spilled that very second while the person was waving her/his hands around... u see what i mean? just the facial expressins will stick.\n\n3. its a lot more fun than studying alone for the reasons above - the misunderstandings, the jokes, the waving around trying to show u how to put X and Y together to get Z...\n\n4. if u dont understand u wont feel subconscious or stupid, cuz that person will NOT mind repeating him/herself over and over again, bcuz ur friends. and then they'll make a joke abt how ur a tubelight and THAT comment will help u remember that thing u didnt understand (while ur in the exam).\n\n5. even if u dont need somebody to EXPLAIN anything, get somebody to at least dictate u chunkc from the portion that u have to study, that way u'll be listening to the info AND manually writing it down - a combo that is bound to make it stick. use colored pens/paper, draw bubbles around titles, space it all out well (dont try to fit too much on a page) - and u've got urself a combination of ALL the psychological, audial and visual factors that help human beings absorb information.\n\nconclusion: get somebody your age to study with u, who won't mind adding a little light-heartedness to the session. DONT ask like ur dad to help cuz he'll just turn into ur teacher and be all stern.\n\nhope this helps.

"Hi, its wise that you are planning. But before you try to make money, ask yourself what you want to do with life. And take a direction accordingly. If it is computing, its a pretty decent line too. \n\n Computer Programming is too vast a topic. A ""How to Program"" course will teach you the basics of programming and applying logic. But depending on the direction you take, you can be a front end programmer (C C++ etc.) or a Backend administration (SQL etc) or Networking specialist, or web coding and design (HTML XML Javascript). \n\nI recommend that you take the course and take some additional courses as well, to find out the direction you would like to take.

1) Krystal Nacht- (the night of broken glass) It was a night at the begginning of the Nazi regime in which the SS vandalized business owned by Jews.\n2) D-Day- the landing of Allied troops at Normandy. This was the first entrance of US troops in the European theater.  It was met with heavy casualties on both sides.  \n3) Pearl Harbor- Japanese kamikaze (sp?) pilots bombed the US naval base in Hawaii in Dec. 1942 hurling the US into war with Japan.\n4) A-bomb- The US dropped the world's first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan, ending the war in the Pacific. \n5) raising the flag at Iwo Jima- US Marines captured the Island of Iwo Jima in the South Pacific, a vital control point in the theater. A national monument in DC depicts the picture taken for Time magazine showing the flag being raised. This was, however, the second flag to go up.\n\nThose are the only ones I can think of.

There is always a chance of becoming pregnant when having sexual intercourse. However, then chance isnt as high as people belive. If a woman has unprotected sex, at the time she is ovualting, she only has about a 25-33% chance of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe 'period' that you could have been experiencing could be implantation bleeding. This is when the fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. This can cause spotting anywhere from 6-15 days after conception, and teh spotting can last anywhere from 1 day to 1 week.\n\nIf anything, at least take a pregnancy test. Urine pregnancy tests can determine a positive pregnancy 12-15 days from conception. A blood pregnancy test can determine a pregnancy 6-8 days from conception.

Co-Education is sweet poison ;) It is slow too.\n\nBoth Co-Ed and Non-CO-Ed have its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nAs you all know, that the Current Situation is worsening because of Movies that picture 'sex' to be such a normal issue. You will find lots of impatient people on YAHOO asking about sex, is it correct, what is this, what is that. Does she like me, Should i kiss him, how to kiss him.\n\nYou see, if students come to realize that Love and Sex is so normal. Then all those studying in non-Co-Ed will become Frantics and will want to interact with females in their neighbourhood. It become more difficult to control those who actually don't interact with females too much. The scene can be analysed better if you think:\n\nNon-Co-Ed Frantics will want to hook up with any girl whom they can be with, generally whomever they interact with. Whereas the Co-Ed Machos have so many options - they have to choose 1 girl of so many in their class. \n\nAgain, Those Co-Education Machos, if not taught discipline will slip from the staight path i.e. go astray. If they get addicted - the scene is worse. It is lot easier to control a non-co-ed Frantics who is not addicted but desperate.\n\nSo which do you think is poison??? and what is the cure???\n\nI suggest Discipline from early age. Parents should use:\n\nhttp://www.spare-rods.com/

20 years is too late? Girl are you wrong! I bet you think 30 is old. No it is never too late. But, do it for the right reasons. You can't do it for the money.

You probably still think getting drunk and attending parties is real fun. Well forget it if you go to MED school. You will have to do it on your own. Join a study group with fellow classmates. But, only you have the chance to get past Medical school. It is an achievement that only you can get.\n They will not give you the answers, you have to earn them.

I'm not so sure that I will agree with you on the issue! you know as for everything maturity is the key, when we are young you go to church because our parents take us there, we don't choose our religion we follow our parents. I believe that the religion does not save, your faith does, however being surrounded by true believer make the path of spirituality much easier. My opinion and advice to you would be to keep learning about GOD words, read your Bible as often as possible get explanations on point that you do not understand clearly, and don't get involve in any debate yet give yourself a couple of more years to be ready to do so.... I'm not saying to hide that you love GOD, I'm saying not to debate on religion or faith for now.

Most learners do. During this time, you are listening to the sounds of the language before attempting to speak it. This period can last up to several months and it is a normal part of language learning.\n\nBecome involved in extra-curricular activities (athletics, drama, clubs, etc.).

An all African American unit, the 369th fought in World War I under the French Flag because the United States refused to have African American soldiers in combat.

But when they returned home to the United States, they were subjected to the racism of the era, and discovered their service in World War I meant nothing to their fellow Americans.\n\nI know about  the  54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Co. in the Civil War and the Tuskegee Airmen in World War II. The History Channel shows more other black groups that were fought for our country through out the years.\n\nMy hat goes to these men who fought and died for our freedom.

Extermination camp (German: Vernichtungslager) or death camp was the term applied to a group of facilities set up by Nazi Germany during World War II for the express purpose of killing the Jews of Europe, although members of some other groups whom the Nazis wished to exterminate, such as Roma (Gypsies), Soviet prisoners of war, Poles and many others, were also killed in these camps. Prisoners at these camps were not expected to live more than 24 hours beyond arrival. This was part of what has become known as the Holocaust.
Never!\n\nThe sun is not big enough to become supernova. You need a star of 5-8 times the mass of the sun.\n\nStars like the sun are made of 75% hydrogen, 24% helium and 1% of other stuff. Their cores are hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium. When the hydrogen in the core is exhausted the star goes through the red giant state in which it fuses helium into heavier elements like oxygen, sulphur all the way up the periodic system upto iron.\n\nFor the sun the red giant state will start in 4-5 billion years. Time enough to move to another star.

We fought in both theaters simultaneously.  Europe just ended quicker.\n\nI suppose you could say that we pushed a little harder in Europe.  If that is the case it was to try to get to Berlin before the Soviets.  We already knew that there was going to be future issues with the Soviets, and Germany would figure into those conflicts.\n\n\n\nI hate to rain on your parade anehiemsports, but we didn't start fighting Germany (and Italy, for that matter) until after Pearl Harbor as well.  Once we declared war on the Japs, Germany and Italy declared war on us.  We in turn declared war on Germany and Italy.
I believe that refers to Ferdinand Saussure, the linguist who developed the theory of laryngeals in common Indo-European phonetics (ancestor to most European, north Indian, Iranian languages). It was a controversial theory for a long time, proposing a sound that no longer exists in any of the modern Indo-European languages. Saussurianism, I guess, is a school of thought on Indo-European phonology.

Yes. In addition, as a high school principal, I introduced a team concept at the high school level. I did this in the 80's and still believe it is the answer to teacher isolation. ALL research shows unequivocally that until and unless teacher isolation is dealt with, NO CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM OF DELIVERING INSTRUCTION WILL WORK. \n\nIf teams are formed and allowed to make decisions about the educational delivery to students, they will have a strong commitment to seeing to it it works. In addition, the teachers can be held more accountable. \n\nThe problem with high schools and the implementation of teaming is that the SCHEDULE CANNOT rule. Students' needs must come first, and the tyranny of the schedule needs to be dealt with.\n\nWe did just that, and for three years teaming at the high school for grades 9 and 10 worked. Then a new principal came in and had different priorities. The result was teachers on each team were NOT given a common planning period which ultimately rendered the team inefficient because the teachers could not work together to plan, to work with parents, and to organize the delivery of instruction.  Once again they were isolated and alone.

"The word ""algebra"" is named after the Arabic word ""al-jabr"" from the title of the book al-Kitāb al-muḫtaṣar fī ḥisāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala, meaning The book of Summary Concerning Calculating by Transposition and Reduction, a book written by the Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Ḵwārizmī in 820. The word al-jabr means ""reunion"". Al-Khwarizmi is often considered the ""father of algebra"" (though that title is also given to Diophantus), as much of his works on reduction are still in use today. Another Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam developed algebraic geometry and found the general geometric solution of the cubic equation."

Many say States Rights and Slavery.  The 'States Rights' answer stems from the fact that the Southern states refused to accept Federal interference with their self government.  The 'Slavery' answer stems from the fact that the particular conflict involving States rights versus Federal, in this case, was slavery.  While both are good answers, the root cause of both conflicts stems from economic pressures.  The newly invented Cotton gin provided significant financial benefits from a slave based cotton economy.  So one might suggest that Eli Whitney caused the American Civil War, when he made cotton such a lucrative venture.

It is unclear in your question whether you want a job or to gain further qualifications. Have you tried The three universities in Adelaide - Adelaide University, Flinders University and the University of South Australia. They may be able to advise you.

I notice you rarely get an intelligent answer to good questions. You get mindless robots parotting those slogans. Nothing above made any sense. Oh well the lemmings are idiots. The anti-racist flocks are chock full of only low IQ (under 116) fools with some evil intelligent leaders that come up with the slogans. You were right in hate springs from love and only can exist in connection to love since we only hate that which is a threat to who or what we love. Yet the silly thoughtless ones would not or could not reflect on what you said so they responded based on the mindless stupid slogans they know about love & hate. Yes hate can only be ended if love is. Yes those with strong love have strong hate for anything or anyone that is a threat to that love. Yes those that care little about ANYTHING or anyone (not even themselves) even though they pretend love - well they can not muster much hatred because they do not give a hoot about life and things that are important. Indiscriminate love is not real love. It is like saying we all are special (look up the word) which obviously makes being special very UN-special so to speak. Indiscriminate love is weak or non-existant love or pretend love. Love should only be reserved for your own kind and then only those deserving of it . Hate is for anyone that threatens that love.

"Studying is a big part of being a top performer, but it's not enough.  You need to have the desire to learn!  For me, the easiest way to build this desire is to try to mentally apply all lessons to something in life outside of school.  This worked for me with everything except algebra. For years I would ask ""why do I need to know this?"" I never got any good answers until I was out of school for 9 years. The answer was quite simple ... Algebra teaches you to think!  I really wish I knew this when I was in school. I barely passed with a D in high school, and had to take Algebra 098 in college to get into other math.\n\nWhen you have a desire to learn, studying doesn't really exist. You are on a quest for knowledge. You'll often need to find more resources to fulfill your need to know.  It's a wonderful adventure, continuing your whole life, not ending when the last bell sounds in your senior year.\n\nGood luck, I hope you can build this desire!"
Carbon is a vital component of all known living systems, and without it life as we know it could not exist. The major economic use of carbon is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuels methane gas and crude oil (petroleum).

Crude oil forms the raw material for many synthetic substances, many of which are collectively called plastics.\n\nReally, visit Wikipedia...most of the info there is pretty sound.

"Metaphors are very effective ways of developing ideas in poems; one special form, the ""extended metaphor,"" can be particularly effective in certain situations. An extended metaphor is a comparison that provides the basis for an entire poem or for a lengthy section of a poem; its value lies in keeping the reader's attention focused on a single clear image while at the same time allowing the writer to develop a number of different aspects of an idea.\n\nFor instance, look at ""The Hound"" by Robert Francis:\n\nLife the hound\nEquivocal\nComes at a bound\nEither to rend me\nOr to befriend me.\nI cannot tell\nThe hound's intent\nTill he has sprung\nAt my bare hand\nWith teeth or tongue.\nMeanwhile I stand\nAnd wait the event.\n\nThe poem begins by equating ""life"" and ""the hound"" and creating a clear image of the dog running towards the speaker (thereby giving tangible substance to the otherwise abstract ""life""). The speaker cannot determine the dog's intention--whether it will attack or warmly greet--because its appearance is the same in either case. Only once things have progressed past the point where the speaker can effectively react does he learn which was the dog's intention, so that all he can do is to wait in uncertainty to learn which it is to be. By grounding the entire poem in a single specific, concrete, commonplace occurence, Francis is able to generalize about ""life"" without resorting to vague abstractions.\n\nand this is what an extended metaphor basicly is\n\nA metaphor brought up in the beginning of the poem is lust being of evil desire holding an image of sweet pleasure and deception. Lust is described as perjured, which means to tell a lie. As the feeling of lust makes you think its something romanticized, it's really not. Lust is also called ""Murderous, bloody, full of blame, /savage extreme rude, cruel, not to trust"" These descriptive words help the reader to understand that lust is to be blamed for caring a lie of emotions and feeling, during and before lust. In the poem, Shakespeare describes the desire ""a bliss in proof"" and then contradicts the statement by saying ""A very woe"". The contradiction is carried through out the poem in following lines. In the middle of the sonnet, the speaker voices "" Past reason hunted"" meaning the lust we find ourselves searching for with feelings, similar to love. ""Past reason hated"" being the remembrance of regret for such lust and unfolding the lies of what you thought you were feeling. \nIn conclusion, through out the poem, it's this battle of pleasure possessing evil qualities and lust masking itself to be pleasurable. It's a win, lose situation of emotions one must carry in one's personal indulgences."

In 1991, the commission established the annual income for all elective members in state government. In 1992, the annual salary for a state legislator was $52,500; majority and minority floor leaders each receive $57,750, :and, the speaker of the Assembly and the Senate president pro tempore each receive $63,000. \n\nThe State Board of Control sets the level of per diem paid to the legislature. In 1992, the per diem allowance for living expenses while on legislative business was raised from $92 to $100 per day. A legislator is eligible for living expenses for each day spent on state business in Sacramento. A specific request must be made for living expenses for official time spent outside of Sacramento. \n\nEach legislator also receives $5,400 or 90 percent, whichever is less, towards a state-leased automobile, allowances for postage, expenses in district offices, and mileage on personal cars. The state pays commercial transportation costs and expenses for cars owned or leased by the state.
Lisbon, Portugal's latitude is approxiametley 38.42N. Equator is 0. If you divide the circumference of the earth (approximately 25,000 miles) by 360 degrees, the distance on the earth's surface for each one degree of latitude or longitude is just over 69 miles, or 111 km. Note: As you move north or south of the equator, the distance between the lines of longitude gets shorter until they actually meet at the poles. At 45 degrees N or S of the equator, one degree of longitude is about 49 miles. \n I don't know how exact your answer has to be but roughly its the degree(38.42) x 69 = 2650.98 That does not take into account the fact that every latitude number is actually smaller than the previous as noted.

Your question begs all manner of smartazz answers, but to be serious and perfectly blunt, your odds of finding a decent job as a high-school dropout are very slim. There are a lot of factors that will make it hard. Most importantly, by dropping out of high school you are voluntarily stepping to the back of the line when it comes to getting a job. All else being equal, companies will hire a person who has proven that they have the persistence to complete school and not even consider you. That alone sets you back. Another strike against you is that many jobs require at the very minimum a high school diploma or a GED. You can't even hope to interview with them without one. Basically you will spend the rest of your life competing against other dropouts for the crappy low-paying jobs. But if that's really where you see your dreams taking you, then there's no better time to quit school than tomorrow morning.

Orpheus.He went to rescue Eurydice. He entered Hades and played his lyre to make Kerberos, the guardian of Hades fall asleep. He then made a deal with Pluto the god of Hades, that Eurydice could go back, if he didnt look at her all the way till the end of the path. He didnt make it though. Close to the end of the path, the gate of Hades, he looked back, so she vanished.
No if you prepare every sentence it will look funny. If you plan to do so then please do rehearse so nicely that your dictiona nd your delivery looks absolutely spontaneous.\n\nIf you are a good speaker, just made a structure in points and write down notings about phrases or quotations to be used. It will look very natural and you will also have flexibility to incorporate last minute changes or replies to other peoples  point in your delivery. \n\nThats oKay if u made the full speech - in fact it'll make ur life easier.

Well, you're just 13 so it might be pretty hard finding an actual job so you're probably going to be stuck with the basic jobs. (Babysitting, pet sitting, car washes, candy bar selling, etc) But there are a lot of willing people out there who like to help young kids trying to earn money, especially kids who are raising money for special causes. I guess a trip is a good enough cause. I just don't know what the trip is about so, good luck!
Reading will definitely help, especially if it is from a variety of writers, genres and time periods.  Word of the day type things work for some people, but others totally blow it off.  I had a teacher once who gave us extra credit for finding Vocabulary/ Word of the Day words in our books.  You could do something similar for students who take the time to learn a random word from the dictionary well enough to use it, or teach it to the class.

"Relevance theory is a proposal (by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson) that seeks to explain the second method of communication: implicit inferences. It argues that the human mind will instinctively react to an encoded message by considering information that it conceives to be relevant to the message. By ""relevance"" it is meant whatever allows the most new information to be transmitted in that context on the basis of the least amount of effort required to convey it."

Let me begin by saying that it's a very bad idea for full-time first-year law students to do anything except attend classes and study. First year is crucial for establishing your credibility and learning the basic foundations of a legal education. While grades are not everything in the job search game, good grades will create opportunities that might not otherwise exist. First-year grades are particularly important with larger firms when making their hiring decisions for the summer following second year.\n\nAfter a grueling first year, though, some students feel they understand the school routine and can balance it with part-time work. There are several reasons full-time students choose to work part time. First and foremost is the money. If you work as a clerk at a firm, hourly wages will differ depending on the firm's size and region. In my hometown of Pittsburgh, for instance, small firms will pay anywhere from $10 to $25 an hour for a part-time law clerk. Your career services office should have information on hourly wages in your area.

Saint Gregory III, pope (731-741), a Syrian by birth, succeeded Gregory II in March 731. His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by the iconoclastic controversy in the Byzantine Empire, in which he vainly invoked the intervention of Charles Martel. Also during his reign he conferred the pallium on Saint Boniface in Germany, Willibald in Bohemia, and Bede in England carried on their most successful missionary labours. He died on November 29, 741.\n\nElected by popular acclamation, he was the last pope to seek the Byzantine exarch's mandate.

"Assessment! If a teacher sees that a student is having difficulty in a particular area it is their responsibility to figure out why. Test the student in the area of need and analyze the results (look for a pattern). Then give the student some direct instruction in the area of need. Try to use different modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic etc..) to teach the student what they need to know. Then re-test and see if there is any improvement. If there is keep doing what you are doing. If not try something  different. \n\nRemember ""If students are not learning the way you teach, teach the way they learn."" :)"
"Here's some starts at least.  You still have to fill in the details; that's what homework is for.  Sorry, kid.\n\nEight Ways to Survive:\n\n1.  Reproduction, or in this case fecundity.  Many insects will lay thousands or even millions of eggs, to help ensure that at least some of their offspring will survive.  Someone once figured out that if every egg laid by one housefly were to survive, and if they all grew up to lay their own eggs, and if all those eggs survived, and so on, within one year the entire earth would be covered 6 inches deep with houseflies.\n\n2.  Rapid adaptability to changing environments.  This is part of fecundity.  With all those offspring, the genetic changes (mutations) happen more frequently, and so if there are any changes in the environment they can adapt more quickly as a species.  An example is a kind of gray moth somewhere in England.  Their wing color was perfect for them to blend in with the gray barks of certain trees.  Then a coal factory was built nearby, and the soot began to darken the barks of the trees.  The gray-winged moths were easy marks for birds and other predators, but the offspring that happened to have darker wings had a better chance to escape.  Within just a few generations, all the gray moths had changed to dark moths.  When the factory eventually shut down, and the soot started to wash and wear off the barks of the trees, guess what happened?\n\n3.  Which brings us to camouflage (hiding).  There are some pretty amazing examples of insect camouflage.  Google ""katydid"" and ""stick insect"" for a start.\n\n4.  Speed.  There's a kind of spider that lives in the desert.  It goes up to the tops of sand dunes, trying to collect moisture from the morning air.  But if a predator comes along, it curls up its legs and rolls like a pinwheel down to the bottom.\n\n5.  Symbiosis -- that's where two different species help each other out.  Did you know that some kinds of ants are actually ranchers?  They take care of a smaller species of insect called aphids, protecting them and helping them find food.  In turn, the aphids secrete a liquid which the ants use as food for themselves.\n\n6.  Strength.  Most insects have exoskeletons -- instead of bones, they have a hard, armor-like exterior to protect themselves against attack.\n\n7.  Speed.  There's a good reason why flies, mosquitoes and other flying insects move so fast and erratically.  It makes it harder for birds to catch them.  And many insects that don't fly can hop through the grass pretty quick.\n\n8.  Nastiness.  Thee's also a good reason why so many insects look creepy and icky:  To scare off/gross out would-be predators.  If that doesn't work, many insects have weapons of their own, claws, fangs, even venom.\n\nThere, that should give you enough to start with, at least.  You're still going to have to do some research work on your own.  Otherwise it woldn't be ""homework,"" would it?  :o>"

"Identifying good posture\nBasically, having correct posture means keeping each part of the body in alignment with the neighboring parts. Proper posture keeps all parts balanced and supported. With appropriate posture (when standing) it should be possible to draw a straight line from the earlobe, through the shoulder, hip, knee, and into the middle of the ankle.\n\nBecause people find themselves in several positions throughout the day (sitting, standing, bending, stooping, and lying down) it's important to learn how to attain and keep correct posture in each position for good back support, which will result in less back pain. When moving from one position to another, the ideal situation is that one’s posture is adjusted smoothly and fluidly. After initial correction of bad posture habits, these movements tend to become automatic and require very little effort to maintain.\n\nIdentifying incorrect posture\nThe first step in improving posture is to identify what needs improvement by examining one’s own posture throughout the day, such as sitting in an office chair, carrying objects, or standing in line. At regular intervals during the day, take a moment to make a mental note of posture and back support. This should be done through the normal course of a day to best identify which times and positions tend to result in poor posture. Some people find it easier to ask someone else to observe their posture and make comments or suggestions.\n\nExamples of bad posture and back support \nThe following are examples of common behavior and poor ergonomics that need correction to attain good posture and back support:\n\nSlouching with the shoulders hunched forward\n\nLordosis (also called ""swayback""), which is too large of an inward curve in the lower back\n\nCarrying something heavy on one side of the body\n\nCradling a phone receiver between the neck and shoulder\n\nWearing high-heeled shoes or clothes that are too tight\n\nKeeping the head held too high or looking down too much\n\nSleeping with a mattress or pillow that doesn't provide proper back support, or in a position that compromises posture\n\nExamples of bad posture while sitting in an office chair\nThe following bad habits are especially common when sitting in an office chair for long periods of time. \n\nSlumping forward while sitting in an office chair\n\nNot making use of the office chair’s lumbar back support\n\nSliding forward on the seat of the office chair\n------------\nPosture for a Healthy Back\nWhat is good posture?\nPosture is the position in which you hold your body upright against gravity while standing, sitting or lying down. Good posture involves training your body to stand, walk, sit and lie in positions where the least strain is placed on supporting muscles and ligaments during movement or weight-bearing activities. Proper posture: \n\nKeeps bones and joints in the correct alignment so that muscles are being used properly. \nHelps decrease the abnormal wearing of joint surfaces that could result in arthritis. \nDecreases the stress on the ligaments holding the joints of the spine together. \nPrevents the spine from becoming fixed in abnormal positions. \nPrevents fatigue because muscles are being used more efficiently, allowing the body to use less energy. \nPrevents strain or overuse problems. \nPrevents backache and muscular pain. \nContributes to a good appearance. \n\n\nProper posture requirements \n\nGood muscle flexibility \nNormal motion in the joints \nStrong postural muscles. \nA balance of muscles on both sides of the spine. \nAwareness of your own posture, plus awareness of proper posture which leads to conscious correction. With much practice, the correct posture for standing, sitting, and lying down will gradually replace your old posture. \nWhat contributes to bad posture?\n\nobesity \npregnancy \nweak muscles \nhigh-heeled shoes \ntight muscles; decreased flexibility \npoor work environment \npoor sitting and standing habit"

"At its core, Brave New World is a ""novel of ideas."" The characters are often ill-defined, serving mainly to advance the themes Huxley wishes to explore. The novel is roughly split into three sections.\n\nThe first section introduces the reader to the World State and the characters that inhabit it. Bernard Marx begins the novel as the apparent main protagonist, portrayed as one of the few individuals in a world of conformity.\n\nIn the second section Huxley defies traditional utopian novel structure as he introduces a separate and contradictory version of the future, the Malpais Savage Reservation. Both of them are presented in an equally convincing fashion, allowing Huxley and the reader to contrast his futuristic utopian vision with contemporary society. This contrast is made even more evident by his introduction of the character John the Savage. Here again, Huxley defies convention by introducing the novel's real main protagonist nearly halfway through the novel. An outcast in both the Savage Reservation and the World State, John replaces Bernard Marx, becoming a heroic (albeit flawed) figure. With John's arrival in the World State, a place already somewhat familiar to the reader, Huxley is able to provide a new perspective for the reader to consider.\n\nThe third section deals almost entirely with John's reaction to, and inevitable destruction by, The World State."
"In the monotheistic sense (for all religions that believe in only one god - not only Christianity), ""god"" by definition cannot have been created; anything that is created by anything else cannot be called ""god.""

But we can be somewhat sure it had a beginning because ... it is here."

"Thought or thinking is a mental process which allows beings to model the world, and so to deal with it effectively according to their goals, plans, ends and desires. Concepts akin to thought are sentience, consciousness, idea, and imagination. \n\nidea: the content of cognition; the main thing you are thinking about; ""it was not a good idea""; ""the thought never entered my mind"" \n\nthinking: the process of using your mind to consider something carefully; ""thinking always made him frown""; ""she paused for thought"" \n\n\nKant speaks of the understanding both as a faculty of judgment and a faculty of thought. Here he defines thought as ""knowledge by means of concepts"", where concept is taken in an undetermined sense as ""predicates of possible judgments"". [A55/B79] Kant distinguishes pure and empirical thought about an object and first introduces transcendental logic as that logic ""which should contain solely the rules of the pure thought of an object""."

"A bit is 1/8 of a dollar or 12.5 cents.\n\nYou can figure that out from context too.  2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, a dollar.  In sequence that means they are describing 25 cents, 50 cents, 75 cents, a dollar.  Thus a bit is half of 25 cents.\n\nThe origin of bit comes from the practice of cutting the Spanish dollar (peso) into eight radial pieces to make change.\n\nThe term persists colloquially in the United States as a holdover from colonial America when Spanish dollars minted in Mexico, Bolivia and other Spanish colonies were the widest circulating coin. Spanish dollars were deemed equivalent in value to a U.S. dollar. Thus, twenty-five cents was dubbed ""two bits,"" as it was a quarter of a Spanish dollar.  Because there was no one-bit coin, a dime (10c) was sometimes called a short bit and 15c a long bit.\n\nEven the New York Stock Exchange continued to list stock prices in eighths of a dollar until June 24, 1997 (at which time it started listing in sixteenths, but later going to decimals in 2001).\n\nIn computers there are eight bits in a byte... so there might be some relationship there to the Spanish bits... I'm not sure. \n\nAnd do you remember that knock pattern (dum-da-da-dum-dum, dum dum)?  The words to that are ""Shave and a haircut, two bits""  That must have been awhile ago because I certainly can't get a haircut these days for 25 cents... or if I could, I'd be afraid of the results.  :-)"

"These students are hiding from the world with their college lifes and are afraid of the real world.  No matter which college you attend, they all are nothing like the real world.  Also, these students are probably the homeless people you'll see in a decade or so.  Most people run out of funding for schooling eventually...especially without the education behind them to find a good job.  Why would anyone possibly want to spend extra time in school?  It decreases their earning potential (there is such a thing as ""over-qualification""), adds extra anxiety (exams, grades, etc.), takes extra years off of their life, makes them that much farther from retirement, and they won't earn as much over a lifetime because it's less time in the job market."

Need more detail...  Continental uplift (geological plate techtonics) can bring the sea floor above the water.  Particularly in India, because it is its own subcontinent that has been on the move a lot over the last couple of million years.  However, that does not mean it will become desert.  Forests become deserts when the trees die or are cut down (there is a huge problem with forest clearing in India) and the soil erodes, leaving nothing for plants to grow on.
Here you go:\n\nPhotography has always been seen as the most accurate visual representation of an event.  The action of light reflected from an image hitting photographic film captures a moment in time as accurately as the film in the camera.    \n\nThat relationship has been shaken in recent decades (namely, this and the last) due to digital imaging, which can manipulate almost any image to create something that looks very real but isn't.   \n\nIf you want to challenge the premise a bit, there are numerous examples of staged photographs and photographs misrepresented by the press.  My favorite is the image from the Challenger explosion in which Christa McAulliffe's parents are pictured in anguish over what has happened.   The only problem is that the picture was taken prior to the explosion and showed their reaction to the idea that their child was going into space.   The actual pictures after the explosion show more confusion than anguish.

"Pyramid construction in Egypt began around 2600 BC, the last known royal pyramid was built in Egypt around 1550 BC.\nGeneral History of Pyramids in Egypt and Nubia:\n\nThe pyramid is thought to have developed out of the mastaba tomb. Mastaba is an Arabic word, meaning bench, which was applied to the flat-topped, slope sided superstructures of tombs. The pyramid is also thought to be associated with solar worship and the ""ben-ben"" stone which played a major role in sun worship and was vaguely pyramid shaped.\n\nIn the 3rd Dynasty, several mastabas were stacked forming the Step Pyramid of King Djoser. By the 4th Dynasty in the reign of Snefru attempts at building a true pyramid were underway. The pyramids of the 4th and 5th Dynasties, including those at Giza, essentially reflect the further refinement of the pyramid, the chambers within it, and the associated temple complexes. Eventually the standard style was an orientation of east to west (significant in Egyptian religion), with a pyramid temple, located directly on the east side of the pyramid, and a causeway leading to the ""valley temple"" located near the Nile at the edge of the cultivation.\nWhile it is accepted by reputable Egyptologists that pyramids served as burials for kings, the exact details of the theology behind them remains unclear. One idea, popularized I believe by Dr. Mark Lehner, one of the foremost experts on Egyptian pyramids, is that pyramids served as ""resurrection machines"" providing all the necessary means for eternal life with the gods for the dead king.\nIn the late 5th Dynasty in the Pyramid of Unas at Saqqara, we have the first appearance of formal texts within the pyramid itself - the appropriately-named Pyramid Texts. These texts are somewhat esoteric and are essentially a collection of spells, stories, and guides relating to the Underworld. Initially these texts were limited to royalty. In succeeding pyramids, elements of the Pyramid Texts were included in the ""Coffin Texts"" of the First Intermediate and Middle Kingdom and in the ""Book of the Dead"" of the New Kingdom - texts available to a broad spectrum of society.\n\nPyramid construction continued in the Middle Kingdom - again limited to royalty, but not on the grand scale of the Old Kingdom. The last known royal pyramids located in Egypt are that of King Ahmose, founder of the 18th Dynasty of the New Kingdom (ca. 1550 BCE) and the pyramid-cenotaph constructed for his grandmother, Queen Tetisheri. Both are located at Abydos.\n\nIn the New Kingdom, pyramids came to be part of tombs for reasonably wealthy private individuals - frequently added to the exterior portico area of rock-cut cliff tombs or appearing as architectural elements of brick constructed tombs in varous parts of Egypt.\n\nThe Napatan and Meroitic kingdoms in Nubia (modern Sudan) also used the pyramid for royal burials at sites such as El-Kurru and Nuri. While the Napatan kings ruled Egypt for a time during the 25th Dynasty and were buried in pyramids, those pyramids were located in Nubia proper.\nPyramid Construction:\n\nPyramid construction relied on highly skilled teams of workmen who were housed nearby the pyramid fields - in the Old Kingdom located in the general vicinity of the ancient capital Memphis at sites now knows as Giza, Saqqara, Meidum, and Dashur. A few pyramids in the Middle Kingdom were located near the Fayum, roughly Middle Egypt.\nIn addition to the full-time workmen, there was likely a seasonal labor requirement asked of the lower classes of Egyptian society - a sort of taxation, often referred to by the French term ""corvee"" labor. This is distinct from slavery. While the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (writing over a thousand years after the construction of the pyramids at Giza) reported that he was told the pyramids at Giza were constructed by slaves, Herodotus was wrong about any number of things in his reports and may not even have visited Egypt"

Isn't it illegal for eggs to travel that fast?\nEspecially since the presence of a brick wall strongly suggests that this is taking place in an urban area. \n\nYou have a lot of unaddressed variables here:\nAt 8 ounces this is an uncommonly large egg.\n(It could of course be an ostrich egg, which might account for its extreme speed and size.)  \n\nWhich part of the egg hits the wall first?  \nEggs are of course ovoid, and the lateral surface would present a greater surface area to the wall.  \n\nIs the egg still inside the ostrich?  \nThat would certainly skew your results, and would probably skew the ostrich.    \n\nIf it isn't an ostrich egg, the formula below is less applicable,  since present terms are dependent on the mass/viscosity of ostrich eggs.  \n\nHowever, all things being equal, where: \n\ne is the egg's weight in ounces,  \nm is its velocity in miles per hour\nc is the clot who threw it in the first place.  \n\nThe requisite formula proves to be e=mc2\n\nQ.E.D.
Going to grad school might be a good option for you, if you want to get work in  your field or to find something completely different. Many employers see it as a logical way to transition from one field to another, and you need a more recent, applicable educational credential in order to make up for your lack of recent work experience in the field. But your quantitative GRE score is really low for Computer Science graduate programs, so I'm concerned. \n\nAnother option for you is to NOT go to grad school right now. Instead, get a certificate or take the classes to become certified in a specific area of computer science, such as programming. That will also give you the boost you need to get back into computer programming. \n\nI think I remember the following universities offering distance learning, graduate certificates in specific areas of computer and information sciences.

"Like the previous response, several instances of foreshadowing occur in Of Mice & Men.  Lenny's size, propensity toward petting/killing ""soft things"", etc. are repeated and made very obvious.  You could look at Curley's wife in  similar light.  She is not unlike a small animal, somewhat lost in the world and affected by many forces beyond her control.  She is also naive.  The story about the movie offer and her blind belief that her mother derailed her chances of living her dream life support this idea.  In addition, her physical ""beauty"" in contrast to the bleak scenery and lives of the many farmhands makes her almost otherworldly.  The innocence conveyed by her angelic features and naivete qualifies her as unique and somewhat ethereal (i.e.- too good for this world or life).  Some might dispute this, based on her behavior toward the farmhands, but you should consider her background and desperate efforts to gain any form of attention available to a woman in her position.  I think Steinbeck prepares you for her inevitable death (and the peace she finds in death - see the description of her lying in the barn) in both obvious and not-so-obvious ways.

"*History*\nThe @ sign may have evolved from the Norman French ""à""\n\n@ appears to be the cursive form of ā, an abbreviation of an unknown word beginning with a. In medieval European manuscripts, abbreviations were generally indicated by drawing a line over or through the letters, as in the common IX for Jesus Christ, or # from lb for libra 'pound'. In the typeface of the Gutenberg Bible, ā stands for either an or am within words. However, it is not known which particular word gave rise to modern @.\n\nA commonly accepted theory is that the symbol is derived from the Latin preposition ad, which means about with numerals. However, no document showing this usage has been presented.\n\nA similar idea is that @ is the abbreviation of the Greek preposition ana (ανά), which means 'at the rate of' when used with numerals, exactly its modern commercial usage.\n\nA more recent idea has been proposed by Giorgio Stabile, a professor of history in Rome. He claims to have traced the symbol back to the Italian Renaissance in a Venetian mercantile document signed by Francesco Lapi on May 4, 1536. The document talks about commerces with Pizarro and in particular the price of an @ of wine in Peru, where <@> stood for amphora (Italian anfora; Spanish and Portuguese arroba). The word arroba still means both the @ symbol and a unit of weight (see below). Under this view, the symbol was used to represent one amphora, which was a unit of weight or volume based upon the capacity of the standard terracotta jar, and came into use with the modern meaning ""at the rate of"" in northern Europe.\n\nHowever, @ could be the abbreviation of any word beginning in a, and more than one such symbol was likely in use, but there is no continuous record between any of the possibilities and the modern symbol.\n\nAn alternative view is that it derives from Norman French ""à"" meaning ""at"" in the sense of ""each"". ""2 widgets à £5.50 = £11.00"" is the sort of accountancy shorthand notation you will see on English commercial vouchers and ledgers all the way into the 1990s, where the usage was superseded for accountants with its e-mail usage. It is used in this way in Modern French also.\n\nAccording to this view, the @ symbol is simply a stylish way of writing the à, so as not to remove the hand from the page in making the symbol. You can see hybrids between @ and à in French handwriting in street markets to this day.\n\n*Modern uses*\nThe symbol's most familiar modern use is in e-mail addresses (sent by SMTP), as in jdoe@example.com (""the user named ‘jdoe’ working at the computer named ‘example’ in the ‘com’ domain""). Ray Tomlinson is credited with the introduction of this use in 1972. This idea of user@host is seen in many other tools and protocols as well: for example, the command ssh jdoe@www.example.com would try to establish a ssh connection to the box with the hostname www.example.com using the username jdoe.\n\nIn the programming language Perl, the symbol prefixes variables which contain arrays, as opposed to scalar values (indicated with '$') and hash tables / associative arrays ('%'). If the code were to be treated as a sentence, this prefix would be the equivalent of a determiner, so ""@animals"" might be read as ""these animals"".\n\nIn the IRC protocol, @ is the symbol for a channel operator. IRC also uses the user@host form (often preceded by nick!) for identifying and banning users. In this case the user@ part was originally an ident response and the host part was a reverse dns name from the user's IP. However, most modern IRC networks provide some mechanism for users to hide their real reverse dns hostname and/or for admins/privileged users to pick one arbitrarily.\n\nThe @ character is also used as an alternative political spelling for typing in some Romance languages as a gender-neutral substitute for the "

I recently did a research paper on the explosive economic growth of China and how they're letting it ruin their environment.  It's an interesting topic.  Their population and life expectancy has skyrocketed too.  Did you know that the average life expectancy in 1949 was only 35 years?  Today it's approaching 80.  You could just focus on how China's economy has doubled in 20 years, or you could relate that to their poor polution control practices.

The path of the Sun leads directly with the pure chemistry of things, whatever it might be or you might wanna call it, but its a path where you can develop certain abilities in the spiritual world, that are absolutely going to take you to deeper meanings of understanding.  This path generally comes with solitude, hand in hand, as well as the moon path, that on the opposite, deals with emotions and with more suble things than the sun path.  They are very similar, and where the moon path doesnt reach, the sun one does.  They complement each other.\n\nWhile on the sun you will learn how certain techniques can be achieved, *alchemy, meditation, telequinesis, telephaty, magnetism, and much much more*, on the moon side, you will learn how to deepen and work with the world of the emotions, using external symbols, attributes, characteristics, or even aids, such as stones, elements, cards, snails, birds, and everything you might want to imagine.  \n\nThere is a path though, that is seldom talked about, and its the forbidden and the forgotten path, which is a combination of the two.  Dangerous, cause it teaches you where one complements the other and you can use them at the same time, as a salamander uses colors or as the sylphids use wind, or other entities use all available tools at the same time. By using both at the same time, the hidden path opens before you, and you will enter an entirely different phase, where you will think you have been left alone.  You will be tested and of course, you will have to proof you have what it takes to go forward, this is the path where few can cross and can remain.  There the rest of the hidden wisdom is handled at WILL and the secrets, are no longer secrets, cause you will become One with them.\n\nBlessings,
"""Flash Card Baseball"".  Make up flash cards with the vocabulary words (Spanish on one side and English on the other).  Simple words are a ""single"".  More difficult words are a ""double"".  Since triples are rare, a few very difficult words would earn a ""triple"".  The extremely difficult words would be a ""home run"".  Missed words would be an ""out"".\n\nDivide the class into two teams.  First one team is ""up"".  Either a member of the opposing team or you is the pitcher and shows the word (flash card).  Keep track of the score.  When a student correctly identifies a word, she or he actually goes over to the ""correct base""; the students actually move around the classroom to the correct base, some of them eventually score.\n\nYou can make your own rule modifications to fit your class.  Students will be rooting for their team mates.  This will be fun, educational and promote student morale.

"Very people carefully observe the complicated distinctions between ""shall"" and ""will"" -- which are made much MORE complicated by the fact that in traditional use, the senses of each word used with the first person are ""flipped"" when used for the second and third persons.\n\nIn general, you probably do not need to worry about using it.  But in case you run across someone saying or writing ""they shall"" here's what to do with it (assuming they are using it correctly and not just acting snooty!) \n\n""you/they will"" is a simple future tense (statement of fact)\n""you/they shall""  implies something more, usually a guarantee (certainty) or obligation.\n\nIf you are familiar with the King James Version (or something like it) of the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, you have plenty of good examples.\n\nThink, for instance, of command forms like ""Thou shalt not"" (modern ""You shall not"" or ""Do not"").  These express an obligation or demand.  Or consider the ending of each of the Beatitudes.  Each implies a promise/certainty (""they shall inherit the earth"", etc. ) with the implication that the SPEAKER is certain or will make certain that it happens.    So, as an assurance, you might say (fomally) ""They [you]  shall have what they [you] seek.""  (Compare the biblical ""Ask and you shall receive..."")\n\n(Conversely with the first person.  Traditional ""I shall"" was the simple future, and ""I will"" was a strong statement of purpose/certainty, sometimes of WILL-fulness!  Think of someone  insisting, ""I don't care what anyone says. I WILL find a way to do it."")"

The other day I was shopping downtown with my imaginary friend Margaret. We have a lot of fun together, but she is quite frugal, which is awkward when I want to buy something extravagant. Take my prom, for example. Margaret and I had to find dresses to wear so we could be beautiful, but instead of going to the department store everyone else goes to, Margaret demanded we go to a thrift store. After an hour or so, I decided I needed to get out of there before all the good dresses at the other shops were gone. Discreet as can be, I slipped out of the dressing room and ran.

I'm not an American or an illegal alien so I have no attachment to this debate but it seems to me that the reason there is a difference between in and out state tuition is a result of one paying state taxes, correct?  That is, by paying state taxes, you subsidize your education giving a lower in-state tuition.\n\nThus, if you work in a state at a legal job (whether you had to result to identity theft/using fake SSN to get hired) or just by paying sales tax on your purchases you've EARNED the right to that subsidized in-state tuition.\n\nNow people may get angry and debate this for whatever emotional reason but since they've already paid, why can't they benefit as long as they've resided in the state long enough to qualify for in-state tuition?  It's not like you're giving them free money.  It's THEIR money as well.  Granted, they have no right to be in the country in the first place but by paying taxes and otherwise acting as responsible citizens they've paid for that subsidy.\n\n/end rant.  Don't know why I got worked up there but now I want to explore this issue further and write your paper!  j/k\n\nThat being said, this issue confuses me.  If you KNOW they're illegal, why aren't you shipping them home rather than wondering whether or not they should get in-state tuition and other benefits?

Well the ticket + the popcorn + the orange drink = $7.00\n\ndivide that by the hourly wage of $5.25\n\nand you will get the number of hours necessary...1.333333\nor 1 1/3 hours\nor 1 hour, 20 minutes\n\nUpdate:\nI started questioning my answer after seeing everyone else's responses, so I double-checked it this way:\n1 1/3 hours at (times) $5.25 an hour\n(4/3 * 21/4) = 84/12 = 7\n= $7.00\nYep, I stand by my answer.  You would need to work 1 hour and 20 minutes (1 1/3 hours) in order to earn $7.00

Hey! Girl,\n\nIt would be advisable to keep in touch and set a schedule where one would visit the other and vice versa. \n\nBased on my experience back in my college days, I've been dating my ex bf for 5 years since 3rd year high, and when I went to College which is 1 1/2 hour drive from home and stayed in the dorm, we haven't seen each other for quite a while, he sometimes visits me but not so often as he goes to college too or I will go home and have time to visit him. Since my interest changes due to my college experience with my new found friends in the exclusive school for girls, our communication was not quite as often as before. I discovered that he was seeing another girl. After a few years, that relationship didn't even last, until I went abroad to work. After a few years, I came back on a holiday and happen to meet him again but he's already married to someone else. But we're still friends, and we still belong to our circle of friends since high school. I have no regrets for moving on to college, staying in the dorm or going abroad. I improved myself. I keep meeting new friends and sometimes a new boyfriend, but that's just it. Relationship is good while it lasts, it gives me joy and inspiration. \n\nI suggest that you move on with your life and embrace the new experience while you still have your boyfriend at heart. Develop yourself and improve yourself, it's for your own self worth. If he would have time to see you, it means he's committed to you. But if the schedule is kind of hectic at times, keep yourself busy. Don't worry about it, you're still young.\n\nTake care.\n\nMitch

"Teachers teach the material they do because the government tells them to.  They are given objectives that are to be met and have to decide the best way to present the material.  Majority of teachers do try to incorporate different activities or teaching strategies in order to meet the needs of all students.  Smaller assignments, quizzes and in class activities are used to help assess the students understanding and in some subjects a unit test will be given.  THe purpose of a unit test is to evaluate how the student is able to tie EVERYTHING together.  \n\nSome people believe teachers are testing too much but sometimes a test is the only way to truly evaluate what the STUDENT knows.  How many parents ""help"" their children with the homework?  Some parents complete the homework for the children because they want their child to get a better grade.  Children learn through doing and by making mistakes. The problem with sending home homework is how does the teacher know how much of the work was completed by the actual student.  If the student is only producing a level 2 in class but on homework assignments hands in level 4 work...why does the difference exist?\n\nEducators need to have the support of the family.  A lot of educators do not agree with the current curriculum but have no choice but to follow the guidelines set out."

If you draw on the apothem to each corner of the shape then you can make 6 isosceles triangles. if you split these in half then you get 2 right angled triangles. You can then use pythagoras theorum to find the height ( - you know the length of the hypotenuse as it is the apothem, and you can work out the angle by dividing 360 by 12.)\nYou can then find the perpendicular height between the mid-point of one side and the centre of the shape. You can use this to find the area of eahc isosceles traingle (1/2 base x height) and simply multiply this by 6 to find the area of the whole shape.\nThe same process can be done with the pentagon.\n\nAnd for each you can use the values calculated to find the perimeter.

I do not think they should be allowed in school because students will text message during class. As it is, students already do not pay attention. Teachers do not get paid enough to deal with students texting on cell phones in their classrooms. What is the need for cell phones? To call for a ride home? There should already be a time set up. If anything changes, then they can use a phone provided by the school. Yes, cell phones are fun to play with during class, I admit, but honestly, out of a class of 30 people, 10 pay attention fully. That's not good. What is American education coming to?

(27)\n\n\never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky.\nNever shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever.\nNever shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.

Working in degrees\n\nUse the equivalence sin(x) + cos(x) = sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45)\n\nYou have 2 * sin(x) = 1 - 2 * cos(x)\nRearrange and divide by 2: sin(x) + cos(x) = 1/2\nThen sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45) = (1/2)\nand thus sin(x + 45) = (1/2) / sqrt(2)\n\nAfter that it boils down to calculator bashing\n\n(1/2) / sqrt(2) = 0.3536\nx + 45 = 20.71 (degrees)\nx = 335.7 degrees\n\nI'll leave you to sort out whether there are other solutions.

Love it!  It is not an easy job.  Love seeing students catch on.  Keep finding ways to grab the students' interests.  Interested students will learn more by themselves than you can ever force upon them.  Keep learning alive!  Go beyond the dry curriculum and find human interest stories to bring to class.  Make learning hands-on!  Pique students' interests by encouraging them to do experiments and see results.  Don't do it all for them!\n\nBe personal.  Be their friend.  Maintain respect.  Keep romance with an adult, never with a student.
It is considered a good school by existing U.S. standards. My degrees are in education and I consider all the schools here and in the U.S. as very very bad and failing in their main goals and that is to TEACH. The exceptions to this are the parochial(Catholic, and private, etc) schools which put more emphasis on education.

You are not crazy yet, but if you keep thinking that you have to be perfect one day you will be crazy. Perfection is for God and you are not. Just look at it like this. You did everything you could but it didn't happend the way you wanted, but at least you got the chance to try. Do you know how many doesn't even get the chance or have the intelligence to do or acheive what you have? Besides a grade is one moments classification. You have your whole life to prove that you are better than that B if that is your concern. It would feel better not to think that you are perfect but that you are human and that as one it is more probable that you will make a mistake at one point in life. Some will be worst than others but they are all mistakes. But if we put our trust in The One who is perfect we will be blessed with His perfection and kindness. So for the next time instead of putting your faith in yourself and your efforts just put it in God and you will see and experience His perfection in what you do. God Bless.

Chief Minister is Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, born in 1949, popularly known as Y.S.R.\nHe is known for his forthright speech and frank approach. Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy hails from Pulivendula, a small town from Cuddapah district of the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nDr.Reddy belongs to the Indian National Congress party and was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Pulivendula Assembly Constituency of Cuddapah District. He has been Chief Minister since May 14, 2004. He served as the leader of the Opposition in the House for the previous term during which N. Chandrababu Naidu was the Chief Minister.\n\nY.S.R. is a medical science graduate from the M.R. College of Gulbargaa. He did his House-Surgency in Sri Venkateshwara Medical College, Tirupathi. Upon completion of his MBBS degree, he served as Medical Officer in Church of South India's Campbell Hospital in Jammalamadugu in the Diocese of Nandyal for a brief period of time. In 1973 he established a 70-bed charitable hospital at Pulivendula in the name of his father, Sri Y. S. Raja Reddy. The hospital continues to serve the poor to date.\n\nA doctor by profession, Reddy made his debut in politics as a Youth Congress Leader. It is interesting to note that he and his present opponent, TDP President Nara Chandrababu Naidu, made their debut at the same time (1978) in the Andhra Pradesh State Legislative Assembly as young legislators of the Congress party. They both worked together as Ministers in Sri. Tanguturi Anjaiah’s cabinet. In fact Sri Chandrababu Naidu acknowledges him as his mentor in politics.\n\nY.S.R. had an active political career over a quarter of a century and has been representing his party on different fora. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Cuddapah constituency four times, and a similar number of times to the Andhra Pradesh State Assembly, from the Pulivendula constituency. He twice served as the APCC President. He remains one of the very few national politicians who have never lost an election.

the way I see it there are 4 kinds of teachers. The 2 good kind, or at least have good intentions are 1. teachers who are strict because they care about their students and want them to make something of themselves. 2. Teachers who are leniant on students because they know they're just fooling around or don't want to crush their spirit; and then the not-so-good kind, #3. The kind of teacher who is strict because they just dislike the student or the class in general and #4. the teacher who is very leniant because they really just don't care. I've had all 4 kinds throughout my life. you cant tell the difference between numbers 1 and 3 because #1 will usually seem to genuinly care about their students and will try to organize exciting things or make classes more interesting. and the difference between #2 and 4 is that number 2 wants to be the nice teacher, and show the students that they care through that. #4 Just kind of sits at their desk and plays solitaire.

Okay, if you are a historical person that likes a ton of research and history, than you could write about a character going through a war.\n\nEx.\nEmily Turner going through the Revolutionary War as a Loyalist to King George.  She is about to be married off to a Patriot named Stephen, but has a lover on the side who is siding with King George, and she runs off with him.  You could tell the story in 1st or 3rd person point of view.  Just make sure you don't go into anyone making love.\n\nAn example if you wanted to do, like the Holocaust:\n Anne, 15, as a Jewish girl-not Anne Frank- trying to run away from the Nazi soldiers, while her family is fleeing to Sweden.  Her father gets captured as they get close enough to Sweden, and she screams for him with her 3 little sisters and 2 older brothers.  Talking about her journey to get to Sweden.  Whether she makes it or not is your decision, along with her mother and siblings.\n\nIf you are a mystery type of person than you could talk about a mystery going on.  I'm not a really good mystery thinker, so I'll just make up a few fake ones.\nEx.\n Detective Hans, 42, is going to a murder mystery and he spots that there are blood stains on a carpet square, but the person who was murdered didn't shed any blood and was certain that the blood was from a murderer, even though the police thought that it was suicide.\n\nIf your a nowatimes writer.  Like you want to write about situations that are going on right now.\nEx.\n Faith and Hope, 7, lost their mother and father in the Iraqi war, and are in an orphanage after their beloved Aunt Diana dies from the Avien flu.  You could talk about their journey to get through this and how they are looked at by the families that wish to adopt them.  I think this would be more of a 3rd POV story.\n\nI'll give you one last genre with ideas.  Science-Fiction/Fantasy.  This is really my forte for genre.\n\nEx.\n Alise is in the year 2052 and all the oil is gone.  She must save America before the world goes into crisis mode about how much gas is a problem, because she is the one who is in charge of finding a gas substitute.(Yes, I know some gas substitutes already exist, but pretend like it never happened.) China has already become wanting to go to war with the United States, after the Communist powers had spread and engulfed Mongolia, Russia, and parts of South Asia.  This is a 1st POV\nThis might be a little too fantasy, but:\n Mala, 13, is a mage in the world of Kambro.  There has been an uprising of mages on one side of the world, in Kandribar, but she lives in Kaliz.  The king of Kaliz is trying to kill all of the mages, even though he knows that they are the best part of Kambro, so the second that Mala hears that guards are coming for her family, but that she can't save the whole family, she gets her brother, her female 4th cousin, her best friend, who is a mage, and herself out and into hiding with all of the mage stuff that they can take.\n (That was just the 1st part)Now in Kambro, there is a bit of a problem.  Some foreingers from other worlds have come and are trying to kill all of Kambro, or enslave them.  It is now up to the hiding family to get their act together.  They are now in their mid-20s.  This could be a varying 1st POV story. You get to decide whether they save Kambro or not, or if you want to finish the story in the first part than just do it whether they escape or not.

As a book lover, i would have to automatically say no. But it's true that i read a lot less books and magazines because i do a lot of reading online. But they are far from completely obsolete, and i don't believe that they ever will be. A lot of people still love to snuggle up with a good book sometimes, or read on the bus, or on a plane, etc
Probably not, but some of us have strong math background.
I was like that for almost 2 years. The only piece of advice I can give is this:  Don´t underestimate connections. Ask anyone you now. Even if you have to start low, take it, and build up from there. If you don´t have connections, then try to make them. It is easier once you hace any kind of job. If you have little or no social skills, then get yourself a friend that does and ask your friend to help you or even go with you.  Also, very important: Change your mental state. Develop a positive attitude.  Good luck!

"Within Christianity numerous distinct groups have developed with beliefs that vary widely by culture and place.

The oldest of these separated from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, followed in many cases by further divisions. Some Protestants identify themselves simply as Christian, or born-again Christian. Others, particularly among Anglicans and in Neo-Lutheranism, identify themselves as being ""both Catholic and Protestant"". Worldwide total ranges from 592 to 600 million. \n\n\nOther denominations and churches which self-identify as Christian but which distance themselves from the above classifications together claim around 275 million members. These include African indigenous churches with up to 110 million members (estimates vary widely), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also called Mormons) with more than 12 million members[5], Jehovah's Witnesses with approximately 6.6 million members[6], and other groups[7]. Most of these groups were founded by Protestants."

Internet Marketing is the process of using the Internet to advertise and sell goods and services. These can be goods or services that you produce or source from somewhere else.\n\nThis can involve various techniques including pay per click advertising, banner ads, e-mail marketing, search engine marketing (including search engine optimization), blog marketing, and article marketing.\n\nIt's a fast moving game and you need to keep up with current trends to stay on top.  What was popular a year ago can be ineffective now.

My daughter has a degree in psychology.  She works as a behavioral therapist with youth and adults with autism.  Your best options will probably be in similar types of jobs - counseling and behavior therapy, especially if you don't have a masters degree.  \n\nIf you have only an undergraduate degree my advice would be to work for a couple of years to get good experience, and then go back to school and get a masters as more opportunities.  You might also consider volunteering for a crisis center or shelter - you may even be able to get a job there in some aspect of therapy, support, or counseling.  You can't work as a psychologist with just an undergraduate degree, but I expect you know that. \n\nMany large companies are interested in individuals with psychology degrees as they are realizing that the more technical degrees don't necessarily always prepare individuals well for the real life of work, so check out job postings in areas you might like to live.  You never know what may turn up.\n\nWhat I always advised my children was if they saw a job advertised which they were interested in and thought they could do, apply, even if they didn't have the exact qualifications.  If you can present yourself well, and are a quick learner, interviewers pick up on that - they are always looking for people with potential.  \n\nBest of luck with your job search.

"James Alfred Van Allen (born September 7, 1914) is considered America's foremost space scientist. A majority of his career in research and teaching has been at the University of Iowa. The Van Allen radiation belts were named after him, following the 1958 satellite missions (Explorer I and Explorer III) in which Van Allen had argued that a Geiger counter should be used to detect charged particles.\n\n“Certainly one of the most enthralling things about human life is the recognition that we live in what, for practical purposes, is a universe without bounds.” James Van Allen.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Honors \n2 Timeline (1914-present) \n3 In Search of the Heliopause \n4 Pioneer Anomaly \n5 External links \n \n\n\n[edit]\nHonors\nTime Men of the Year in 1960, one of 15 US scientists honored \nGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1978 \nNational Medal of Science in 1987 \nCrafoord Prize in 1989 \nVannevar Bush Award in 1991 \nNational Air and Space Museum Trophy in 2006 \n[edit]\nTimeline (1914-present)\nSeptember 7, 1914 \nJames Van Allen was born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.\n\n1931 \nJames Van Allen graduated as valedictorian of his Mount Pleasant Public High School class.\n\n1935 \nVan Allen received his Bachelor of Science degree, summa cum laude, from Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant. During his undergraduate years, he studied with Professor Thomas Poulter, a first-class physicist. He tracked meteors, conducted a magnetic survey of Mount Pleasant, and measured cosmic rays at ground level.\n\n1936 \nVan Allen earned his master’s degree in solid state physics from the University of Iowa.\n\n1939 \nVan Allen received his Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the University of Iowa. His doctoral research was on measuring the cross-section of the deuteron-deuteron reaction.\n\n1940 \nAs a staff physicist for the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., Van Allen worked on developing photoelectric and radio proximity fuses for bombs, rockets, and gun-fired projectiles. It was here that Dr. Van Allen acquired his interest in cosmic rays.\n\n1942 \nVan Allen joined the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University to continue his work on proximity fuses. Later in 1942, he entered the Navy, serving in the South Pacific Fleet as an assistant gunnery officer.\n\n1946 \nDischarged from the Navy, Van Allen returned to civilian research at APL. He organized and directed a team at John Hopkins University to conduct high-altitude experiments using V-2 rockets, captured from the Germans at the end of World War II, to survey sounding rocket requirements for upper atmosphere research. The V-2 was found to be too heavy and complex for this task. Van Allen decided that what was needed was a small rocket, derived from the Aerojet WAC Corporal and the Bumblebee missile developed under a US Navy program. He drew specifications for this combination of an Aerojet booster and a Bumblebee second stage for this cheaper rocket, dubbed the Aerobee and headed the committee that convinced the U.S. government to produce it. Aerobees were launched for 53 m tall launch towers to provide the necessary stability until enough speed had been gained for the fins to be effective in controlling the rocket. Launch towers were built at White Sands Missile Range, Fort Churchill, Wallops Island, and aboard the research ship USN Norton Sound. The Aerobee could take a 68 kg payload to an altitude of 130 km.\n\nMarch 1, 1949 \nThe concept of launching of small high-performance rockets suspended from a balloon above most of the atmosphere (later called ""Rockoons""), developed by Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S. F. Singer, and J. A. Van Allen during Aerobee firing cruise of U.S.S. Norton Sound.\n\nApril 5, 1950 \nVan Allen left APL to accept a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation research fellowship at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

For most colleges if you are accepted only the courses that you received a C or better will transfer to the new college. So, the credits that you earned at your first school will transfer, the credits you failed won't.\n\nYour GPA will usually not transfer to the new college; your GPA there will usually only be figured on the courses you take at the new college. \n\nThe fact that you failed the second semester will be more of a problem in gaining admission to another college rather than a problem once you get admitted to another college.
No one. Putting blame on someone is never the solution of the problem.

That all depends. You asked about the CSET so I assume you're in CA. First, you need a BA. I think most programs require you to pass the CSBEST and CSET before they admit you. Then when you are done with your education courses and student teaching you need to take the RICA test (it's a test about teaching reading). I sounds like a lot but it can be done in a school year (if you already have a BA).\nGood luck!

we need obstacles.  to work our minds, bodies and spirits.  to build ourselves up.

Ella Baker, the granddaughter of slaves, was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1903. After graduating from Shaw University in Rayleigh, North Carolina, Baker moved to New York City. Baker joined the Young Negroes Cooperative League and in 1931 was appointed its national director. She was also employed by the Works Progress Administration to provide literacy and consumer education to workers.\n\nIn 1940 Baker became a field secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP). Over the next few years Baker attempted to persuade the organization to become involved in community-based activism. Baker also played a leading role in the campaign to desegregate New York City public schools. \n\nIn 1956 Baker and Bayard Rustin established Friendship, an organization dedicated to raising money for the fight against Jim Crow Laws in the Deep South. The following year she moved to Atlanta to work with Martin Luther King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). \n\nWhile in Atlanta she also ran the Crusade for Citizenship, a voter registration campaign. Baker disagreed with the SCLC's policy of having a strong central leadership. Baker, who favoured local, grassroots action, left the organization in 1959. \n\nIn February 1960, Greensboro, North Carolina, a small group of black students started a student sit-in at the restaurant of their local Woolworth's store which had a policy of not serving black people. In the days that followed they were joined by other black students until they occupied all the seats in the restaurant. The students were often physically assaulted, but following the teachings of Martin Luther King they did not hit back. \n\nBaker became involved in this campaign and in October, 1960, helped to establish the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The organization adopted the Gandhian theory of nonviolent direct action. This included participation in the Freedom Rides during 1961. Leading figures in the organization included Robert Moses, Marion Barry, James Lawson, Charles McDew, James Forman and John Lewis. \n\nIn 1964 Baker returned to New York City and remained active in the civil rights movement until her death in 1986.
Non-formal education is education outside the school. The child's teacher/s would be her/his caregiver/s at home. For example: the child learns the alphabet prior to being taught in school by repetitive exposure to it by her/his caregiver/s. A child with a strong backround in school knowhow will find schooling easier and would grasp concepts faster.

"Clarissa Harlowe Barton (better known as Clara Barton) (December 25, 1821 –April 12, 1912) was a pioneer American teacher, nurse, and humanitarian. She has been described as having had an ""indomitable spirit"" and is best remembered for organizing the American Red Cross.\nContents\n[show]\n\n    * 1 Youth, education, family nursing\n    * 2 Teaching, organizing, learning bureaucracy, a mission\n    * 3 American Civil War\n    * 4 Barton sees the International Red Cross in action\n    * 5 Organizing the American Red Cross\n    * 6 Religious Beliefs\n    * 7 Later life, heritage\n    * 8 Clara Barton's Birthplace House and Museum\n    * 9 Clara Barton National Historic Site\n    * 10 See also\n    * 11 References and additional reading\n    * 12 External links\n\n[edit]\n\nYouth, education, family nursing\n\nBarton was born to Captain Stephen and Sarah Barton in Oxford, Massachusetts. Barton's father was a loyalist to England, and this led to many confrontations between him and his wife. Her father was a farmer and horse breeder while her mother managed the household. The two later helped found the first Universalist Church in Oxford.\n\nAs a child, she was shy and retiring, the youngest of five siblings. All her brothers and sisters were at least ten years older. Young Clara was home-educated and extremely bright. It is said that her older brothers and sisters were kept busy answering her many questions, and each sibling taught her complementary skills, her older sisters being teachers and her brothers happy to teach her how to ride horses and do other things that, at the time, were thought of as being only appropriate for men. She later spent four years at the Liberal Institute in Clinton, New York. At the age of 11, when her brother became ill, for two years Clara stayed by his side and learned to administer all his medicine, including the ""great, loathsome crawling leeches.""\n[edit]\n\nTeaching, organizing, learning bureaucracy, a mission\n\nClara became a teacher at age 17, a post that she was to hold for the next 18 years. For ten years, Clara taught in a small Massachusetts town, where her brother owned a factory. After she was invited to teach in a private school in Bordentown, New Jersey, Barton recognized the community's need for free education, and, despite opposition, she set up one of the first free public schools in the state.\n\nIn 1854 she suffered from a serious nervous breakdown probably brought on by overwork. She took a break from teaching (which would be called a sabbatical in modern times) and attended the Clinton Liberal Institute in Clinton, New York, where she studied analytic geometry, calculus, astronomy, mathematics and natural science in addition to French, German, ancient history, philosophy and religion. Afterward, she was appointed to a job as a clerk in the Patent Office in Washington, D.C. where she learned the ins and outs of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nWhen her father was dying, he gave Clara advice that she would always recall:\n\n    ""As a patriot, he bade me serve my country with all I had, even with my life if need be; as the daughter of an accepted Mason, he bade me seek and comfort the afflicted everywhere, and as a Christian he charged me to honor God and love mankind.""\n\n[edit]\n\nAmerican Civil War\nClara Barton circa 1866.\nEnlarge\nClara Barton circa 1866.\n\nWhen the American Civil War began, Barton resigned her position in the Patent Office to devote herself to the care of wounded soldiers on the field of battle. With the outbreak of war and the cascade of wounded Union soldiers into Washington, she quickly recognized the unpreparedness of the Army Medical Department. In April 1861, after the First Battle of Bull Run, she established an agency to obtain and distribute supplies to wounded soldiers. For nearly a year, she lobbied the U.S. Army bureaucracy in vain to bring her own medical supplies to the battlefields. Finally, in July 1862,"

In general, no, you don't need to pay off your old loans before you can borrow new ones.  In certain cases, your repayment status can affect whether you will be allowed to borrow new loans at your new school.  If you are in default on any federal loans, you need to resolve the default before you can get any new federal loans.  However, resolving your default typically entails making 6 months of on-time payments -- but not paying the loan off completely.\n\nIf you didn't default on the old loans -- if you're making payments when required, etc. -- you should be fine to borrow new ones. The only exception to this would be if, somehow, you have exceeded the aggregate debt limit for that loan type.  The undergraduate *Stafford* loan limit for dependent students is $23,000 (the limit for independent students is $46,000).  Do you currently owe that much?  If not, you'll be fine.\n\nJust file the FAFSA online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov. When it is processed, you will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) with the results -- the Comments section will let you know if there are eligibility issues that you need to tend to.

I read a poll once where children under age 14 were asked to rate beauty...the lowest ratings were of people who were and responsible for making the world a better place  such as Mother Theresa and other notables, the highest were the TV show stars.   Children must be taught to think this way.  it is to our shame that we let this myth  propagate and thus place value in the most superficial aspects of life."

"""Miscellaneous"", things that aren't otherwise categorized."
Not always, but usually. Even if the education level is about the same, private schools usually have smaller classes and therefore each student gets more personal time to bring out their best.\n\nAlso, since most private schools have some sort of uniform, there is not a lot of time and effort put into raging hormones. It allows more concentration on the things that matter in school - learning.\n\nYou will also usually find that more parents are involved in the school life in private schools, and they usually have more resources to augment the education.\n\nThe easiest way to tell is to ask what percentage of their graduates are accepted at university, and how their graduates average in the SAT (or your local equivalent) exams.
Take plenty of fresh air breaks.  Make sure to eat well and drink lots of water.\n\nFlash cards will also help you memorize lots of material in less time.
It means that you have no ability to control things that you are compelled to do.\n\nTraditional (Freudian) psychology states that there are three parts to the psyche - the id, the ego, and the superego.\n\nThe id is the part of the personality believed to be responsible for our impulses and desires.

I'm a Biologist working as a Quality Assurance Tester for a Newspaper, testing their Content Management software and Website.  While I trained as a Biologist, I have only once had a job that I could say was in my career field.  For the past 17 years, I have worked in IT, the first 7 developing software and the past 10 testing software and websites.  What I learned at University was essential to my career today as I learned how to learn what I needed to know to do whatever job I need to do.\n\nThere are only a lucky few people, who end up staying in the career fields they started out in.  Flexibilty and the ability to learn, is the best thing we can learn in our schooling and training.

The largest river in the state of Florida is the St. Johns River which is 310 miles or 500 kilometers long.  It is the longest river in the United States that flows north instead of south.  It is also considered on of the laziest rivers in the world since there is only a 30 foot elevation change from Indian River County to the Atlantic Ocean.  It is not uncommon to find dolphins and manatees swimming the waters of this great lake.\n\nFor a good bit more info this river click on the site below.
If you're going on with a masters afterwards anyway, then I'd say the Engineering will serve you better at the undergrad level, regardless of which direction you choose.\n\nI'm just finishing my Ph.D. in Economics.  When I was applying to grad schools, I was shocked to learn that the Econ grad programs actually give preference to undergrads with Engineering or Math majors OVER Economics majors.  The reason for that is because grad programs in Economics today are heavily math-intensive, and they have observed that Engineering and Math undergrads tend to do better in the Econ programs.\n\nSo, regardless of what you decide to do later, the Engineering major will be better for you.  If you want to keep all your options open, do an Econ minor along with it.  That way, you've got another 3 1/2 years to decide which route you want to take.  \n\nGood luck!
"I think this is a true statement first. Think about it you are usually friends with people who are different then you. Why? Because you like to think that you are unigue and bring something to the table in your friendships. If someone else exhibits the same behaviors that you do you tend to have the defense mechanism kick in and that brings us to ""people like in themselves what they hate in others""\n\nIt's just jealousy and self preservation.

Cotton fiber (once processed to remove seeds and traces of wax, protein, etc.) consists of nearly pure cellulose, a natural polymer. Cotton production is very efficient, in the sense that, ten percent or less of the weight is lost in subsequent processing to convert the raw cotton bolls into pure fiber. The cellulose is arranged in a way that gives cotton fibers a high degree of strength, durability, and absorbency. Each fibre is made up of twenty to thirty layers of cellulose coiled in a neat series of natural springs. When the cotton boll (seed case) is opened the fibres dry into flat, twisted, ribbon-like shapes and become kinked together and interlocked. This interlocked form is ideal for spinning into a fine yarn.
Search through any of the many online scholarship search engines for scholarships.  You can also contact the school that you're interested in attending (or check their website) to determine if they have any institutional funding to give their students.  Some awards or this ilk are based on merit while others are based on need.\n\nApply for as many you can, even if it seems small -- $500 here and there can really add up.  Search for scholarships at unique smaller organizations that might cater to something you're good at that it's necessarily solely academic.  For example, if you're an excellent bowler, look at any websites for bowling associations or clubs and see if they offer scholarships.  Chruches, libraries, and high schools (even if you no longer go to one) also receive hoardes of information on these sorts of things, so you might do well to look there.\n\nSome search engines to try:\n\n* http://www.fastweb.com/\n* http://apps.collegeboard.com/cbsearch_ss/welcome.jsp\n* http://www.scholarships101.com/\n* http://www.srnexpress.com/\n* http://www.scholarships.com/\n* http://services.princetonreview.com/default.asp?RUN=%2Fcollege%2Ffinance%2Fscholar%2FscholInterview%2Easp&RCN=auth&RDN=7&ALD=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eprincetonreview%2Ecom\n* http://www.finaid.org/scholarships\n* http://www.collegeanswer.com/paying/content/pay_free_money.jsp

"As you have surmised to ""lollygag"" is to dawdle, fool around, and just generally do everything except what you should be doing. As a verb, ""lollygag"" (or ""lallygag"") dates back to around 1869, and a noun form, meaning ""nonsense"" or ""foolishness,"" showed up a bit earlier, around 1862. \n\nUnfortunately, the origin of ""lollygag"" is unknown, but there are clues from which we may, perhaps, be able to extrapolate the roots of ""lollygag."" (""Extrapolate"" in this context, by the way, is a fancy word for ""guess."") \n\nFirst up in the batting order of possible ""lollygag"" clues is ""loll,"" which is a very old word originally meaning ""to droop or dangle."" We use ""loll"" today to mean to relax or pass time idly, the sort of behavior that vacations are designed to encourage. There seems to be a plausible connection between this ""utterly relaxed"" meaning of ""loll"" and the ""wasting time"" sense of ""lollygag."" \n\nAnother bit of evidence might be found in the fact that ""to loll"" also means to let your tongue hang out, and that ""lolly"" is an English slang term for tongue (quite possibly the source of the name of our friend the lollipop, by the way). Perhaps ""lollygagging"" arose from the perception that lazy lollygaggers were adept at exercising only one muscle -- their tongues."
Go back and get the degree, if it's what you want. Don't worry about what type of job you'll be able to get. Just do what you love...and money WILL come. That's the law of the universe. As far as your math fobia...just jump in it. That's the only way to conquer your fear. You HAVE to give something to get something. If you are willing to fight through whatever it takes to obtain your degree...I can tell you right now that you will succeed.
You can check and see if you qualify for some type of waiver. Some colleges may have a policy if you come from an economically disadvantage background, and can't afford the application fee, you may qualify for some type of waiver. However, as far as financial aid to pay for college tuition, check on-line for FAFSA or Fastweb, for scholarship and grant research, or even your public library, which may have scholarship and grant books-and instructions on how to apply. One final thing, if you are employed-check to see if your employer offers tuition reimbursement or tuition assistance.
Preparing a body for the afterlife in ancient egypt was a very long and complicated process.  The Egyptians believed that preserving the body in death was important to keep their soul alive.  The Embalmers were priests who were trained in the mummification process.  Mummification was a ritual, so the priests who participated were trained to perform the process with both surgical and ritual precision.  The embalmers were required to work and labor outside of the town in a workshop called a “Wabet” or a clean place.\n\nThe head priest that supervised the ritual wore a terra-cotta mask in the form of Anubis.  Anubis was the chosen god for surgeons, and for priests performing the mummification process.  By wearing the mask of Anubis it symbolized Anubis watching over the mummification process to guide the priests in the ritual.  It was important that the priest did not make any unnecessary cuts in the body, because if the spirit could not recognize the body it would be doomed to wonder across the Earth and possibly haunt the priest responsible.\n\nThe first step in the process was to make a cut in the abdomen, below the ribs, on the left side of the body.  This first incision was done with a special flint knife, and all other cutting was done with an ordinary metal blade.  They had to cut into the body so that they could take out special organs.  Once the organs were removed they were placed in canopic jars, which were carved out of alabaster and inscribed with spells that would one day enable the organs to rejoin the body when it was resurrected.  The organs that were placed in the jars include: stomach, lungs, intestines, and liver.  Once inside the canopic jars each organ was protected by the one of sons of Horus whose head graced the lid.\n\nNext the brain would be extracted through the nose and then thrown away.  Resin was then poured through the nose and into the skull with the use of a funnel, to keep the head from collapsing.  The heart was left in place because later in the underworld Anubis would weigh the heart and guide the soul through the underworld.  During the embalming process every part of the body was saved and either placed in the tomb with the body or given to the relatives of the deceased.  Then, the body and organs were preserved with spices and dried out with natron salt.  The spices that were used in the preservation process made the body look brown and leathery.\n\nThe entire preservation process took about 70 days.  After the process was complete, the body was wrapped in linen.  Death masks were placed on the head of the mummy around the bandages to be used as a replacement head incase something happened to the real skull. Special amulets were placed within the wrapping of the mummy to protect it.  Finally, a “mummy tag,” similar to our toe tags, was placed around the mummy’s neck to help identify it for burial.
Well, give it some thought.  Why would you consider investing in a foreign country?  You would only invest if you feel that:\n\n1. your money would be safe there, and\n2. you would earn a higher return by investing there than you would investing in your own country.\n\nPeople rarely invest as much where they feel the government is unstable or likely to take their assets away.  People also rarely invest where the economy is not growing.

I agree that formulas are important and that you also need to know how to use them. Ideally you should learn the formulas and do practice problems that are like the ones that might be on the test. Also, online resources help if your notes aren't good or if you don't have any. I don't know what level of math you are taking, but here is a site that has links to study guides for many different levels of math. Good Luck!!!
I would say that since either way you're going to learn the information, it would come down to a matter of cost. Would it cost you more to take the course at ITTech or at the jr. college. I'd pick the cheaper of the two, since either way you'll learn the .Net frame work.

First off, distance is a measure of length. When you say that an object is 1 inch long, you are measuring the distance from one of it to the other.\n\nWhen you hear that a space object is X light years from earth, the X light years also represent distance, specifically the number of kilometers light will travel in that amount of time. Since light is so fast that it travels about 186,000 miles per second & since space is so large, it is more convenient to measure distance in space using the distance (the # of miles) light will travel in 1 year then multiply that by a number of years that will give you at least an estimate of how far that object is from earth.\n\nWhile distance is a measurement, displacement, on the other hand, is a rate. When you hear a car was going 100 miles an hour, that is a rate. A 100 miles between two given cities is just the distance between them. But travelling (on foot, on a bicycle, on a motorcycle, by car, by train, by boat, by plane or by any other means) X units of distance (10 kilometers, 300 miles, 50 yards, 2 inches etc.) in Y units of time (30 seconds, 4 minutes, 5 hours, 6 days, 9 weeks, 8 months, 2 years, 1 decade (= 10 years), 4 centuries (1 century = 100 years), or 3 millenia (1 millenium = 1000 years)) then that is a rate.\n\nDisplacement is a rate of change, not merely a ratio between two things, such as a ratio of distance to time.\nDisplacement indicates the change in position, relative to the point of origin & the destination.\n\nIn the example you provide, if Jill moves from point A to point B, then she has travelled a distance of X units, X being the length between them. If she moves from point A to point B then back, then she went back over the distance she already covered. So, in this example, her displacement is 0, because she went over the same length she already covered.\n\nAnother way to look at this is by using a boomerang as an example. If you throw a boomerang, it will always come back to you. Suppose you threw it & it travelled 10 feet then came back. It is said to have travelled 20 feet (10 one way & 10 on the way back) but to have a displacement of 0 because, relative to its starting position & its destination, it returned to the starting point & so it isn't considered to have shifted its position. The distance it travells is irrelevant.\n\nAnother way to look at it is if you go on a trip, say a 1-day fishing trip. Suppose you go to a lake that's 100 miles from where you live. You go there, you stop, you fish & do whatever, then return home. You travelled a total of 200 miles in that day. But, does that mean that just because you travelled those 200 miles then you moved & you now live in a different home at a different address? Of course not.\n\nBut, if you stopped for gas on the way, then your displacement equals the extra distance you travelled to get to the gas station.\n\nSo, onto your questions:\n\n2.    Jack and Jill set out for a morning run. They both run 2 miles North along Rte 3 and then turn and run back South to home (to the starting point). Jill stops at home, but Jack continues to run South for an additional 3 miles to the gym.\n\na. How far did Jill run? (Remember the definition of distance.)\n\nJill ran 4 miles.\n\nb. What was the displacement for her entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.)\n\nHer displacement for her entire run was 0.\n\nc. How far did Jack run? (Remember the definition of distance.)\n\nJack ran 7 miles.\n\nd. What was the displacement for his entire run? (Remember the definition of displacement.)\n\nHis displacement for his entire run was 3 miles, the distance from the starting point (home) to the gym.\n\nI hope that helped.
the way i learned it the standard form of an equation of an ellipse is x^2/a^2 + Y^2/b^2=1\n\nSince x^2 is before y^2 in this problem, the ellipse is horizontal, meaning the major axis is going horizontally. One of the rules of ellipses states that the length of the major axis is 2a units, and the length of the minor axis is 2b units.  therefore, a=9, and b=3 so the equation is x^2/9^2 + y^2/3^2 =1

"In the 1700's or 1800's, these two Englishmen were sitting around shooting the bull, and they got to arguing about who was more clever. One of them said, ""I bet you I can introduce a new word into common usage in one day."" The other guy laughed in his face and took the bet. The first guy spent an entire night sneaking around London with a bag of chalk, writing ""quiz"" all over the place. When people got up in the morning and saw ""quiz"" written everywhere, they started talking about it, asking each other, ""What the heck does that mean, and who did it?"" by the end of the day, the new word, ""quiz"", meant something that was puzzling or baffling. I swear that's how it happened."

I need more information.\nWho are your students?  That is, what level of English do they have now? (none, some, quite good but need help with vocabulary and accents?)\nFor what purpose are you teaching?  To pass an exam?  For daily life (survival skills), for work vocabulary?\nWhat age are your students?  Children, adolescents and adults all learn differently and have different preferences in teachers.  Children and adolescents like to have 'steath' learning--that is, they do not perceive what they are doing as work.  Young adults and adults are more straight forward and generally prefer some homework for example.\nOnce you know the needs of your learners, you can easily plan a course of 10 weeks that suits their needs.
"There are many ""genres"". One would be a response to literature essay, where it is a case of reading a literary work, then describing the insight you obtained from it. Of course, you must prove it by the evidence in the text. Next is the summary, where you again read something and breifly state the main plot. You again need to specifically tell the reader the theme of this work. Another one would be fiction/ nonfiction. It tells an experience, fake or not, and enetertains a reader but also gives the insight and the purpose of it. There is also a persuasive essay, and then the research writing. Those types of writing are the most common in the literary world."
Getting your degree in engineering would definately put you on the right track to getting into this field.  Architecture, not so much...Most schools with programs in Architecture focus on buildings.  You might also look into Industrial Design.  Look for a school that offers courses in Product Design, Interaction Design, Project Management or Transportation Design.  All of those will be physics and engineering heavy, so those are the classes to keep focus on.  Good luck!

"Intuition, it's a gut feeling you get, or as slight as an idea that comes to mind and when you respond something magic and cosmic happens. But it is not the same as thought that we interpret and analyze which inevitably ends up as some sort of logic. Logically intuition cannot exist but it does. I live in a society of intuitives. We work on an intuitive level. With our intuition we do things that benefit our lives and the lives of those around us. I will use myself as an example, for instance'; Ive been thinking about needing to meet with someone in the community. I may think off and on about what I would like to happen, I create scenarios in my mind, then without having thoughts in my head about the subject or person that needs to be involved with me, suddenly I somehow know that I must go and do, or go and be somewhere. I goe there and what do you know, the very person or situation that was required to fulfill my creative thought. I think it is thought that we pass between ourselves and even deeper and more mysterious. It's knowing that you need to be somewhere but your not sure why, and when you get there the cosmic happens and you are fulfilled. It's the shepherd suddenly knowing he needs to attend his flock, and when he arrives he finds the wolf at the gate. It's a mothers nagging feeling that her child needs her and if she learns to listen intuitively and responds on that initial feeling she finds herself correct 100% of the time. However, you may have the intuitive feeling about something, and you in your rationalizations decide to not repond or do something, perhaps even in a different way than you might have. Then the thing occurs and you say to yourself,"" why oh why didn't I listen!""  Intuition can save your life, and the lives of others. Learn to use it, cultivate it and rely on it because it will never fail you. It is your gaurdian angel whispering the secrets of life into your ear."

"Sonora Dodd, of Washington, first had the idea of a ""father's day."" She thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon in 1909.\n\nSonora wanted a special day to honor her father, William Smart. Smart, who was a Civil War veteran, was widowed when his wife died while giving birth to their sixth child. Mr. Smart was left to raise the newborn and his other five children by himself on a rural farm in eastern Washington state.\n\nAfter Sonora became an adult she realized the selflessness her father had shown in raising his children as a single parent. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a courageous, selfless, and loving man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910.\n\nPresident Calvin Coolidge, in 1924, supported the idea of a national Father's Day. Then in 1966 President Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation declaring the 3rd Sunday of June as Father's Day. President Richard Nixon signed the law which finally made it permanent in 1972."

I know a little about the school, and did consider it for my daughter.  It is a very good school, with good results and plenty of activities for girls to get involved in.  I didn't select the school, as I was concerned with their insistance that over time my daughter would need to board there. I think it put my off how much emphasis they put on this. In addition, the few girls I do know who went to the school were highly confident and outgoing.  Which I think represents the school.  Unfortunately, I knew with my own duaghters personality, she might find things a bit too much - as she is quiet and reserved.

Although majoring in science is not necessary, the college student must take 2 courses in Biology, two courses in Chemistry, two courses in Calculus, two courses in Organic Chemistry and a few other must have courses such as Physics and statistics.   Then you must apply to a medical school, complete 4 years of med school and then train an additional three years after med school to become a pediatrician.  Med school tuition costs range from 15,000-45,000/year.

Dude, tell your math teacher he/she is a moron.  This is not a good question.  I majored in Chemical Engineering at college.  I've done more math than your teacher could ever imagine, and I've got to tell you that this question has absolutely no meaning in the real world.  Why?  Because you can't predict how she would work alone based on the information given.  What if she works extra hard when she's around Rick, but slacks off when she's alone.  You can't tell, so the problem is useless.\n\nThat said, here's the answer a moron math teacher (who doesn't really have what it takes to do math in the real world) would want to see:\n\nG + R = -6 (negative because they spent hours.)\nR = -15 (negative because he spent 15 hours.)\n\nplug in R\n\nG + (-15) = -6\n\nG = -6 + 15\n\nG = 9 hours (positive because that's the time she saved Rick when she helped him.  Saved hours are positive)\n\nThus, if you were a moron (like your math teacher) you could assume that it would take G 9 hours to do it alone, but like I said before that's just plain STUPID.

You need to focus on your math and science. It's easier if you start out going for your RN, school takes less time and costs less money. Then if you work as a RN for a few years your continued schooling is just a few years and you can earn a paycheck at the same time. And many employers will pay for you to continue your education so the continuing classes will be free.
A summary of Catholic beliefs is contained in the Nicene Creed (from the year 325): \n\nWe believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all that is seen and unseen. \n\nWe believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, one in being with the Father. Through Him all things were made. For us men and our salvation He came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit, He was born of the Virgin Mary , and became man. For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day He rose again in fulfillment of the scriptures: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. \n\nWe believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son, He is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. We believe in one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n\nFor a complete description of what Catholics believe, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/index.htm\n\nWith love in Christ.
By being the best you can be at what you want to be!\n\nSuccess is measured by oneself...not how others judge.  Be successful for YOU and not for others.\n\nMake something of your life and contribute...that's the important thing.  We're here for a reason - so make something of yourself!!
I cannot say for sure, but it appears that the statue at Yale University is the original sculpture.  The other locations, including CIA have replicas.  My guess is that the CIA wanted the original - but Yale has no motivation to part with that bit of history.\n\nFrom first link:\nA statue of Hale, sculpted around 1898 by Bela Lyon Pratt, was cast in 1912 and stands in front of Connecticut Hall at Hale's alma mater, Yale. Copies of this sculpture stand at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; the Nathan Hale Homestead; the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.; and at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nFrom CIA tour (second link):\n\nOne of three sculptures on the grounds, this statue is a replica of the original work created in 1914 for Yale University, Nathan Hale's alma mater, by Bela Lyon Pratt. The Agency's copy of the statue was erected on the grounds in 1973, 200 years after his graduation from Yale.

A parameter is an argument of a mathematical function that is considered in some way incidental or secondary within a particular context of discussion. Thus, what is considered a principal argument and what is considered a parameter may change from one context to the next.\n\nFor example, a parametric equaliser is an audio filter that allows the frequency of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, and the size of the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency response curve, and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve. More elaborate parametric equalisers may allow other parameters to be varied, such as skew. These parameters each describe some aspect of the response curve seen as a whole, over all frequencies. A graphic equaliser provides individual level controls for various frequency bands, each of which acts only on that particular frequency band.

"Spedusource gave you some good information. \n\nI think if you are trained in speech pathology, that might be where you will best assist the school children with Autism. Many children with Autism have limited verbal language and need much support from a speech-language pathologist. Some techniques that help children with Autism communicate is to use sign language for simple commands (words like ""more,"" ""all done,"" ""stop,"" ""help,"" ""please,"" etc.) or to use pictures. Mayer-Johnson company out of California has great software: Board Maker and Writing with Symbols are two programs I have used in my job. The programs have simple pictures to describe words and activities, and these pictures can be presented to children with Autism in a schedule form, or during Descrete Trial therapy. \n\nEach child with Autism is completely different from one another. They may have similar challenges but each child has to be respectively approached. I have found that I can help a child with Autism best once I have spent some time getting to know them."

Not all of them caught on nationally. The post didn't say very popular dances nationwide, it just said dances from the '60's associated with a song. The Shotgun by Junior Walker is another good example. People in my town did that dance all the time.\n\nDuring the early and mid '60's there were new dances every week.  As new songs came out so did a dance to go along with it.  Only a few dances lasted more than just a few weeks.  Usually when the song faded so did the dance. The was the Hully Gully, The Box, Sissy Strut, the James Brown, and many others that were not very popular and faded with the songs.  I don't know where the dances went but they slowed down in the '70's and almost came to a halt in the '80's."

This is a good site to answer the question
Carbon and Life\n\n    It is hard to overstate the importance of carbon; its unique capacity for forming multiple bonds and chains at low energies makes life as we know it possible, and justifies an entire major branch of chemistry - organic chemistry - dedicated to its compounds. In fact, most of the compounds known to science are carbon compounds, often called organic compounds because it was in the context of biochemistry that they were first studied in depth.\n\n    What makes carbon so special is that every carbon atom is eager to bond with as many as four other atoms. This makes it possible for long chains and rings to be formed out of them, together with other atoms - almost always hydrogen, often oxygen, sometimes nitrogen, sulfur or halides. The study of these is the basis of organic chemistry; the compounds carbon forms with metals are generally considered inorganic. Chains and rings are fundamental to the way carbon-based life forms - that is, all known life-forms - build themselves. Silicon is capable of forming the same sorts of bonds and structures, but opinion is divided on whether silicon-based life forms are a realistic prospect - in part because it needs higher energies to form them, and in part because whereas carbon dioxide (one of the main by-products of respiration, a process essential to all known life) is a gas and therefore easy to remove from the body, its counterpart silicon dioxide (silica) has an inconveniently high melting point, posing a serious waste disposal problem for any would-be silicon-based life form.\n\nFuel\n\n    Almost everything we use as fuel, whether in food or power stations, is also based on one kind of carbon-based chain or another; everything from natural gas through petrol and alcohol to oil to wax and plastic is composed of hydrocarbon chains of various lengths. As a general rule, the longer the chains and the more saturated they are (meaning every atom of carbon bonds to four other atoms), the less volatile and more viscous the substance will be, and the higher its evaporation temparature. This spread of evaporation temperatures makes it possible to separate the wide range of different hydrocarbons present in crude oil through a process known as fractional distillation, heating the oil to a range of temperatures in sequence and collecting the vapors released. The other big class of carbon-based fuel (used universally by plants and animals, but rarely by power stations) is the carbohydrate family - sugar molecules and the things you can make from them, like starch, cellulose and so on.\n\nElemental Carbon\n\n    Besides its millions of compounds, carbon also bonds with itself in different ways to form graphite, diamond, fullerenes and amorphous solids. Under certain conditions, it can also form white carbon - a transparent, biregringent material about which little else seems to be known.\n\n    In graphite, probably best known for its use in pencil 'lead' (for which purpose it is mixed with clay), the carbon is loosely bonded in crystalline layers which are able to slip over one another, so it is relatively soft and deposits itself readily on flat surfaces when drawn over them. It is used as a lubricant, in clay, and as an electrical conductor - one of the few solid, non-metallic conductors. Diamond, by contrast, is the hardest substance known to man; it has a dense, extremely stable crystalline structure, and conducts heat extraordinarily well but electricity hardly at all. Thanks to its hardness it has many industrial applications, while its high refractive index gives jewellery a sparkle which is hard to match.\n\n    Another form of elemental carbon, the fullerene, was not observed until 1985, although the possibility of its existence had been suggested as long ago as 1966. The most basic fullerene, (C60, the buckyball - short for buckminsterfullerene) has the form of a football - that's a soccer ball if you American, or a truncated icosahedron if you're a
"The deity Muslims worship is referred to in Islam as ""Allah"", which is really the Arabic word for God (descended from the Aramaic word for god, which translates as ""Elah"").  \n\nIn reality, Muslims worship the Hebrew god אֶהְיֶה ( and you should read that name from right to left instead of left to right as you would if the name was written in English, since Hebrew is written in the opposite direction).\n\nThe name of the God, should you need a way to pronounce it in English, can roughly be translated as Yahweh, or more loosely as Jehovah.  \n\nIt is the same god worshiped as the god of Creation and the Universe in Judaism, and in Christianity as well, since both Islam and Christianity descend from Judaism and are seen as different, updated ways the one true god of the Hebrews has instructed mankind to worship Him (the practical upshot of which is that while all three religions worship the same god, none of the three see the other two as really being valid since, in all three cases, each religion views the other two as being in error about god's will... the Jews because they do not believe either Jesus or Mohammad and their teachings are valid... the Christians because they believe the teachings of Jesus and his interpretations leading to Christianity render the other two invalid, and the Muslims because they believe the teachings of Mohammad and his interpretations leading to Islam do the same)."

"I had a similar problem during my first Master's Degree. I have straight A's for it, except for one C, in an ""elective."" There was a professor who didn't give us information on how we were doing until the day before the official allowable withdrawl date, then encouraged us to re-write our test and gave out better grades for it rather than withdraw. However, he had a thing against people from my particular major, and after stringing us along gave me (oh joy) the highest grade from my department.... a C. The other students got D's and F's. However, people giving similar responses from other departments got A's and B's. After this, my department changed it's recommended electives for my type of degree to a similar course taught elsewhere. My department head, after reviewing my situation, accepted the course for the elective credit needed toward my degree (the policy for a Master's level was an A or B only) so that I could just move on and not worry about it. I still feel awfully annoyed, though.\n\nIf you have copies of your work, and your professor's comments on them, take it to your department head or college dean, and ask them to look into the situation."

"Louie Spray's Muskie Reinstated \n                     As World's Biggest\n\n                                    By John Dettloff\n\n      \n\nOn Aug. 6, 1992, Art Lawton's world record\nMuskie, originally thought to have been 69 pounds, 15 ounces and  64 1/2 inches long, was discovered to have been falsified (greatly  exaggerated in size) and was officially disqualified jointly by both  the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame and the IGFA.\n\nAs a consequence of that decision, Louie  Spray officially was reinstated as the  all-tackle world record holder of the Muskie with his 69-pound, 11-ounce  fish that he caught out of the Chippewa  Flowage in 1949.\n\nRecapping what let to this bombshell discovery: in August 1991, some very contradictory facts about the Lawton Muskie became known to me and, since so many anglers in the Muskie fishing community have always questioned the legitimacy of his fish, I began to deeply research the matter.   My goal was to neither prove or disprove  the Lawton Muskie, but to learn all of the facts about his fish with a commitment to the  ascertainment of the truth.\n\n       In summary, the Lawton fish was disqualified because it was discovered that  Art Lawton had submitted false evidence to Field O Stream (the  record-keeping body at the time) supporting his world record  Muskie. It was discovered that: the photo he submitted to Field &  Stream as being of his 69-pound, 15-ounce Muskie actually was the photo of a much smaller Muskie of 491/2 inches and 55 pounds and  that the weigh-in affidavit Lawton submitted was false evidence.   The principle weight witnessed had recanted his original story.\n\nAmong the preponderance of evidence discovered proving the fish  to have been falsified, the key piece of the whole affair rested upon  a newly discovered photo of the Lawton Muskie, showing the fish  hanging from a post, clearly showing the true size of the fish. The  photo shows the Muskie to be approximately a foot shorter than Art Lawton's own height -- and not a mere 31/2 inches shorter as claimed by Lawton, who was 68 ""    tall.  Some individuals have made the petty, and unfounded accusations that the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame disqualified the Lawton Muskie in an effort to ""bring the record back home to Wisconsin."" But to anyone knowing the facts, this easily can be dispelled. The fact is, the decision to disqualify Lawton's fish was  not made by a handful of ""Hayward people,"" but by a world board  of approximately 40 Advisory Governors made up of people from  all over the United States, Canada and even abroad. These people  voted overwhelmingly to disqualify the Lawton Muskie solely  because the facts indisputably prove the Lawton fish to have been  falsified.   So, history is once again back on its correct course and the mark to bet is set. It only takes time on the water and that one charmed cast to catapult you into the record books to attain that hallowed  title that Louis Spray now holds with the largest Muskie ever  caught in history - his 69-pound, 11-ounce catch from the Chippewa Flowage.\n\nThe Chippewa Flowage is the home of 17 current world  record fish, 24 of which are Muskies which include the current all-tackle world record Muskie."
Is being a parent easy? Multiply that by 25 and that's how easy it is to be a teacher. You'll never know how hard it is until you experience it. Medicine is also a beautiful field where you change many lives. And just like medicine, teachers must master many branches of the Education field. When someone becomes a teacher, they must also know about being: a parent,a janitor, a nurse, a psychologist, an actor, a musician, an accountant, a lawyer, and a few others. But, we get paid for only one!

Aside from the many societal restraints on the stage, there were also the practical ones which greatly affected how Shakespeare wrote his plays.\n1.  Women were not allowed to appear on-stage, therefore young boys would play the female roles. Many of his plays have few female characters, and those that there are often diguise themselves as men.\n2.  With no electricity, staging was fairly basic.  Characters usually state the location and the time of day so the audience would know what was going on.  An entrance from below the stage through the trap door would symbolize one from hell, and from the rafter above would be from heaven.\n3. Each play was performed by just a few actors in the troupe, so each one played many roles.\nand 4.  The stage itself was outdoors, with the groundlings standing on the floor right in front of the stage.  The upper classes would have seats in the sections above, and the very upper class could pay to sit right on stage.  Also, the atmosphere was nothing like the quiet, polite audiences of today.  A Shakespeare play has been described as being the Renaissance equivilent of cross between and NBA finals game and a Madonna concert.

Honestly, it depends on the employer, the position, and what you hope to do with the degree. \n\nIf you want to move up within your own company, in all likelihood an online degree will help you. It won't hurt you. \n\nHowever, if you plan to change employers, some employers do not consider certain online degrees on par with degrees from brick-and-mortar universities. \n\nTo be completely blunt, if I were looking at your resume, and you had an online degree from some online school, there is no way I'd hire you. However, if you had an online degree from a reputable university, like RPI - they have a great rep as a brick-and-mortar university, and so that carries over to their online degrees - I'd hire you. Likewise, an online degree from UMass, I'd hire you. But from U Phoenix? To be quite honest, I'd pass.

She couldnt have taken 10 minutes to start breathing, she would not survive.\nThe following quote is from the link below about premature babies but it is still relevant.\nTake your baby to a doctor and have her checked out.\n\nBabies normally breathe 20 to 60 times a minute. It is normal for babies to stop breathing for up to 10 to 12 seconds. These breathing pauses are considered to be normal if the baby begins breathing again by himself and there is no change in the baby's skin color and no drop in heart rate. Babies may also have a breathing pattern in which they have a breathing pause and then breathe several rapid shallow breaths. This is called periodic breathing and is also considered to be normal. Pauses between breaths that are longer than 15 seconds or pauses that occur with a change in the baby's skin color and a drop in heart rate are not normal.

The Soviet Union cut off access by land to West Berlin in an attempt to capture that portion of the city, which was under French/British/American control.  The Soviets, however, were unwilling to block air access to the city, for fear that it would lead to another major war, only three years after the Soviets had lost a ton of troops fighting the Germans.

try speaking to yourself in english. and watch for your pronunciation. if you cannot remember a word, don't just use it in your language, try to describe what you are willing to say like you are talking to a foreigner. and for listening try to watch movies in english without subtitles watch BBC or CNN or channels like that. when you are speaking with somebody in english, don't worry if you don't understand what they're saying, just ask one more time, if you don't understand, ask again, there is nothing wrong with this. if you do not know the meanings of the words they are using, just ask, if you don't understand the word, ask him/her to spell it. there is nothing wrong with asking. after some period, you'll see that you are not asking any questions anymore, and you are more comfortable in speaking.

I suggest that you rewrite that part.  For example;  Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper' illustrates her belief that one should take responsibility for their own decisions rather than allowing others to control them.  It appears that her view of life is that to allow others such a level of control prevents the individual from fulfilling the potential of their life.\nI think that you should include some quotes to illustrate why you believe this to be the case.

Oracle was the first relational database management system.  Previous to that data was physically stored in a way, often complex, that would facilitate retrieval.\nSome examples are indexed sequential files or a 'network' database, in which linkage files would be created by the database administrator to allow two files to be combined in a single retrieval.\nA RDBMS stores data simply in lists in no particular order, but runs processes that use advanced algorithms to combine any bits of data of the various files into single retrievals.\nThe complexity is in the software and not in the storage of the data.

Out lines are a valuable tool for doing papers.  They don't just organize the material, which is in itself valuable, they keep it organzied in your mind, and they break down the job into manageable steps.  Often, just making the outline exposes weaknesses and gaps in the material and can also suggest to you better or additional ideas.\n\nAlso, the more outlines of things that you do, the more practice your mind gets in organizing things, so you will tend to get faster at doing papers and letters and so on...

Air pollution is a broad term applied to any chemical, physical (e.g. particulate matter), or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a complex, dynamic natural system that is essential to support life on planet earth. Stratospheric ozone depletion due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the earth's ecosystems.\n\nWorldwide air pollution is responsible for large numbers of deaths and cases of respiratory disease. Setting of air quality standards, such as the U.S. Clean Air Act, has begun to improve air quality for some pollutants. While major stationary sources are often identified with air pollution, the greatest source of emissions are actually mobile sources, principally the automobile. There are many available air pollution control technologies and urban planning strategies available to reduce air pollution; however, worldwide costs of addressing this issue are high. The most immediately available method of improving air quality is adoption of greater use of ethanol fuel (and other biofuels) and increased reliance upon hybrid vehicle technology.

"What are the harmful aspects of TV ? \n\nTV displaces active types of recreation:\nIt decreases time spent playing with peers. A child has less time for self-directed daydreaming and thinking. It takes away time for participating in sports, music, art, or other activities that require practice to achieve competence. \n\nTV interferes with conversation and discussion time:\nIt reduces social interactions with family and friends. \n\nTV discourages reading: \nReading requires much more thinking than television. Reading improves a youngster's vocabulary. A decrease in reading scores may be related to too much time in front of the TV. \n\nHeavy TV viewing (more than 4 hours a day) definitely reduces school performance: \nThis much TV interferes with study, reading, and thinking time. If children do not get enough sleep because they are watching TV, they will not be alert enough to learn well on the following day. \n\nTV discourages exercise:\nAn inactive life-style leads to poor physical fitness. If accompanied by frequent snacking, watching TV may contribute to weight problems. \n\nTV advertising encourages a demand for material possessions: \nYoung children will pressure their parents to buy the toys they see advertised. TV portrays materialism as the ""American way."" \n\nTV violence can affect how a child feels toward life and other people:\nViewing excessive violence may cause a child to be overly fearful about personal safety and the future. TV violence may numb the sympathy a child normally feels toward victims of human suffering. Young children may be more aggressive in their play after seeing violent television shows. While TV violence does not increase aggressive behavior toward people in most children, it may do so in disturbed or impulsive children."

"Global warming is a term used to describe the trend of increases in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans that has been observed in recent decades. The scientific opinion on climate change, as expressed in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report in 2001 and explicitly endorsed by the national science academies of the G8 nations April 2005, is that the average global temperature has risen 0.6 ± 0.2 °C since the late 19th century, and that it is likely that ""most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities"" [1]. The increased volumes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by the burning of fossil fuels, land clearing and agriculture, and other human activities, are the primary sources of the human-induced component of warming. The natural greenhouse effect keeps the Earth about 33 °C warmer than it otherwise would be; adding carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere, with no other changes, will make that planet's surface warmer."
"No, not all religions believe that killing yourself or another being is a sin. \n""ROLLIN: Historically, in most religious traditions, suicide has been considered a sin. In light of this, many survivors have felt religiously stranded. How can their faith help them heal when that same faith may fault their loved one for the act of suicide?""(pbs.org)\n\nBuddhism- Under conditions of illnesses will accept suicide and dismiss it as a sin.\n\nChristianity- It is a sin under Christianity, the bible says ""thou shalt not kill"" so take it as it's said. Cain killed Abel and God according to the bible said the following: ""What have you done? I hear the voice of your brother's blood crying to me from the ground. Now you will be cursed on the earth soaked with your brother's blood which was drawn by your own hand."" And therefore, that instance became known as the first murder in the bible and the first broken family.\n\nConfusianism- also allows suicide under certain circumstances...such as illness\n\nHinduism- hardly and RARELY allows cases of suicide\n\nIslam- Condems the idea and the action of suicide"

I don't know where the 0.07 Amps came from.  You can be killed by a whole lot less!  0.07A is 70 mA.  For perspective, the GFCI trip level is 4 to 6 mA, because more than that can kill you.  The exact amount can vary by person, and some people can be killed even with a GFCI tripping.\n\nThe voltage is important only from ohms law, the higher the voltage the higher the current.  The biggest resistance is the skin, and that is lower when the skin is wet.

Shortest street \nThe world's shortest street is Elgin Street in Bacup, Lancs, UK, which is only 5.2 m (17ft) in length. Trianglen, a designated road with buildings on only one side, at Store Heddinge, Denmark, is only 1.85m (6ft 1in) long. It forms one side of a road junction. \nJames Cloninger adds: I think perhaps you should add one more reference to your designation of ``shortest street'': that of McKinley Street, in Belfontaine, Ohio in the US, which is 31 feet, but unlike Elgin St, is drivable. It has one building (a hardware store) on the north side, bordered by a railway on the south side, and two roads (Garfield Ave and ColumbusAve) on the other two sides which eventually merge about 100 feet on the other side of the rails. \n\nThat ok ?

The Second Punic War broke out in 218 when Hannibal took control of the Greek city and Roman ally, Saguntum (in Spain). Rome thought it would be easy to defeat Hannibal, but Hannibal, leaving 20,000 troops with his brother Hasdrubal, went further north on the Rhone River than the Romans expected and crossed the river with his elephants on flotation devices. \n\nHannibal reached the Po Valley with less than half his men. He had also encountered unexpected resistance from local tribes, although he did manage to recruit Gauls. This meant he had 30,000 troops by the time he met the Romans in battle. \n\nHannibal won battles in Trebia and at Lake Trasimene, and then continued through the Apennine Mountains. With troops from Gaul and Spain on his side, Hannibal won another battle, against Lucius Aemilius, in which the Romans lost thousands of troops, including their leader. The historian Polybius describes the both sides of this, the Battle of Cannae, as gallant, and says of the losses:\n--\nHannibal's army in Iberia reportedly totaled 90,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, although those figures probably include Hasdrubal's forces as well as Hannibal's. The expeditionary force would still number as many as 75,000 foot soldiers and 9,000 horsemen. His army also had an unknown number of war elephants. \n\nAfter completing his overland journey, Hannibal descended from the foothills into northern Italy. He had arrived, however, accompanied by only half the forces he had started with, and only a few elephants. In total, Hannibal had lost as many as 20,000 men and all but three of his war elephants

I think you may be mixing things up a bit.\n\nYou can become a Registered Nurse without getting a Bachelors of Science but it is getting harder to find nursing programs that do that.\n\nYou should TRY and get a Bachelor of Science Registered Nursing degree if you can.  I am not a nurse, but I work with a lot of them in a hospital and I see the job postings.  Most job postings are looking for BS RN.  More opportunity for you if you go that route, more advancement, management etc.  BIGGER PAYCHECKS.\n\nBut do not let that stop you, if you can become a Registered Nurse without it then go for it.  You can always get the BS degree later on.\n\nGood luck.

With your college courses as a nondegree student at the community college, it would make you eligible to apply as a transfer student. It does have its advantages though because of the number of applicants is different than applying as a freshman.  It would also mean you would have to send your community college transcript, so you could get credit for the credits you have taken already towards your degree. I have included some links that could help you better understand the application and admission process. If you have further questions, talk to the transfer advisor at your community college or an admissions counselor at Boston College.

"R.S.V.P. stands for a French phrase, ""répondez, s'il vous plaît,"" which means ""please reply."" The person sending the invitation would like you to tell him or her whether you accept or decline the invitation. That is, will you be coming to the event or not? Etiquette rules followed in most Western cultures require that if you receive a formal, written invitation, you should reply promptly, perhaps that same day. For hosts who are planning a dinner party, a wedding or a reception, this is important from a practical point of view, because they need to know how many people to count on and how much food and drink to buy. More important, though, is the simple courtesy of responding to someone who was nice enough to invite you, even if it is to say that you regret that you will not be able to attend"

It's easy if you have a Bachelor's degree and a TESL certificate that included supervised teaching practice.  If you don't have those two things you'll have a harder time finding a job, and when you do find a job you'll have much worse working conditions and lower pay.  \n\nWhen I decided I wanted to teach overseas I waited until I finished my BA (actually, I left the morning after my grad ceremony) and then enrolled in a Certificate in English Language Teaching to Adults (CELTA).

It's very different from school to school, I'd suggest talking to your guidance counselor and parents about why and if you should skip a grade. Skipping a grade isn't just about you being smart, you also need to be able to make up all of that work and knowledge that you're going to miss. Especially in subjects like Math, where you constantly build on previous knowledge, skipping grades can be a fairly bad idea.\n\nIf, after careful thought, you still want to go through with it, then the only way would be through asking someone in your administration, probably a guidance counselor or a dean perhaps. Usually they don't allow people to skip grades unless you're below high school, but even if you are at the high school level there is still the possibility of graduating early.

In some ways, we already have a sort of voucher system for higher education.  Think about how Pell Grants work.  They are available to the student, to be applied, regardless of where the student attends.\n\nI think the only question is whether states ought to follow the federal model.  My view is that it does seem to work fairly well, but I think there are other issues below the surface.\n\nState budgets spend a great deal for higher educational institutions, many of which behave as though they are accountable to no one.  This proposed change is a way for states to force universities to be financially accountable.    But, if this expense is set aside,\n\nEffectively what you end up with is a nation full of private universities.  Private colleges from Harvard to Seton Hall have provided excellent education in this country for years, and there's no reason to think they can't continue.  Further, schools that are freed from the onus of state planning often thrive.  But some will surely decline, and in those cases, the state governments will be left with the decision of whether to let them die or to bail them out.  In the end, these bailouts may end up being more costly than any structure that now exists, so states would need to decide how committed they are to this new approach.\n\nIn the end, I think it may be a wonderful experiment, and I'm anxious to observe while one or two states experiment with it.  If it were my state, however, I'd proceed cautiously, as there are many unknowns on the horizon, and I'd rather watch someone else and learn from their mistakes first.

Seahorses can't technically *get* pregnant, although they can carry the unborn baby seahorses in a pouch, so it is sort of like being pregnant, I guess.\n\nBut the main reason that human men can't do it is that we are mammals, not sea animals.  In mammals, whether it is dogs, cats, gorillas, sheep, tigers, or humans, one characteristic is that the babies grow in a placenta inside the female.

"A slurry is a mixture, which comes in different varieties:\n\nMetal Slurry can be used in pipe fitting and other welding tasks, as well as slurry based bombs like the BLU-82. \nIn farming—perhaps the most well-known use—farm slurry is a mixture composed chiefly of water and animal sewage. It has a distinct odour, noticeable when the substance is carried in tankers, or spread over fields. Misapplication of farm slurry can lead to environmentally damaging emissions of ammonia and other chemicals. See fertilizer. \nA liquid mixture (especially involving water) composed of a mixture of various insoluble matter, such as mud or plaster of paris. \nA special kind of slurry consisting of approximately 1% pulp (wood fiber) and 99% water, used to make paper, is called stock in the papermaking industry. \nSlurry pipelines are a specialized method of material transport that use a watery slurry to move particulates from location to another. \nIn wildland firefighting, slurry is a term used for the fire retardant dropped on a forest fire from an aircraft. ""Slurry bomber"" is a colloquial term for those aircraft. See aerial firefighting. \nIn cooking, particularly in restaurant kitchens, slurry refers to a mixture of a thickening agent (often cornstarch) and water, as a means of dispersing the thickener into hot sauces and soups near the end of the cooking process without forming lumps. Slurry can also refer to the mixture of coffee grounds and water in some kinds of brewing processes, such as a french press. \nMeat slurry is a product made from meats, making them more readily transportable, as well as removing fats, pigmentation and myoglobin. \nIn mining, slurry is a sort of liquid waste material that's stored elsewhere."

When we eat and swallow our chewed food, that food moves down our esophagus through rhythmic contractions of muscle tissue. The esophageal sphincter is a ring-structured muscle that effectively acts as a door to food going from theesophagus into the stomach. It normally stays closed but opens only when letting food into the stomach from the esophagus. Some people have a condition called GERD in which the contents of the stomach- which are very acidic- reflux (flow back into) the esophagus, irritating it, This condition is believed to be caused by a malfunctioning esophageal sphincter that sometimes stays open by accident.

"It's one thing to ""publish"" a book...but to print it...that's another story...anyone can have that done. Publishing requires a lot more work. You have to send it out to companies to see if they are even interested in it and think it could be marketable. \n\nFor printing, you need to know the size/format of the book. That is the first step. You need to figure out how many pages it will take up in that particular format. Figure out if you want a color cover/back sleeve or not. Color costs more to print. How many copies do you want to print as well. What type of paper do you want it printed on?

The scholarship giver generally sends a letter to your college, and if the money is recieved by the school before it is time to disburse your loans, etc., you will recieve any extra as a refund.  They will probably give you some type of a certificate and will pay the college of your choice when you do start college. If all of your tuition has not been paid in full, the scholarship will be applied to your tuition.  Apply for everything you can, because you will get everything over the amount you owe the school in a check to you as a refund.

"The Seattle School Board\n\n\nThe Seattle School Board is considering bringing student bus service in-house — an additional $6 million annual expense that would bring driver salaries and benefits in line with surrounding districts'.\n\nThe board's Operations Committee will consider the proposal this afternoon.\n\nThe district has been contracting for bus service since the 1970s, so providing it would mean starting from scratch: hiring about 400 drivers, buying buses and leasing land for a bus barn. A district study said it would cost an additional $62.9 million over the next 10 years, raising the cost over the decade to $148.9 million from $86 million.\n\nSupporters of the idea say it would improve working conditions and benefits for drivers, which in turn could lower driver turnover and improve services for students.\n\nBut opponents say this isn't the time to devote more money to transportation. The district has been struggling for months to save $2.5 million a year by closing seven schools.\n\n""I've been opposed to it from the outset,"" said board member Michael DeBell, who serves on the Operations Committee along with members Mary Bass and Irene Stewart. ""Obviously, we're not in a position to spend significantly more money on our busing, our transportation costs. ... I believe that it's in the best interest of the district to save money wherever possible outside of classroom instruction.""\n\nMost surrounding school districts provide their own bus service. Seattle contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student.\n\nDistrict buses?\n\n\nThe Seattle School Board Operations Committee will discuss bus-service options at its meeting from 4 to 6 p.m. today at school-district headquarters, 2445 Third Ave. S. In addition to discussing the contracts with Laidlaw Transportation Services and First Student, the committee will hear a report on a pilot program that placed Ballard and Franklin high-school students on Metro buses this school year. The School Board has discussed for several years bringing yellow-bus service in-house. In 2005, three board members — Stewart, Bass and Sally Soriano — voted against the current bus contract because of concerns over wages and benefits for the 400 drivers involved. That contract expires in June. Laidlaw employs about 80 of the district's drivers, and First Student employs the remainder.\n\nSoriano said the Portland School District decreased its driver turnover to single digits by switching from contracted bus service to directly hired drivers to transport its special-education students. It's the responsibility of the board to try to improve the stability of the district's work force, she said.\n\n""The overarching issue is that the board has tried to get the drivers to have it be a stable work environment,"" she said.\n\nStewart and Bass, who chairs the Operations Committee, did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nLaidlaw drivers voted to join the Teamsters in May. Since then, they've been in contract negotiations. First Student drivers are not organized, though Teamsters Local 174 business agent Chuck Deaver said there's an effort under way.\n\nLaidlaw drivers are treated ""very well,"" said Betty Zaloudek-Moore, the Seattle branch manager. ""I think this is a very positive work environment. Our drivers work very hard.""\n\nThe committee also will consider providing district-operated transportation for its special-education students. That would cost about $12 million over 10 years.\n\n""I think the idea of in-housing the transportation goes beyond the treatment of the drivers,"" said Robert Augustin, a Laidlaw driver who has been driving Seattle district buses for eight years and supports the proposal. ""From the board standpoint, they think they can save some money in the long run.""\n\nIf the district employed bus drivers directly, driver salaries would increase about 3"
Rowntree conducted a study of poor families in York in 1899 and drew a poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money ‘necessary to enable families … to secure the necessaries of a healthy life’ (quoted in Coates and Silburn, 1970). The money needed for this subsistence level of existence covered fuel, and light, rent, food, clothing, household and personal items, and was adjusted according to family size. According to this measure, 33 per cent of the survey population lived in poverty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seebohm_Rowntree\n\n[Charles Booth's] most famous work is undoubtedly the seventeen-volume Life and Labour of the People in London (1889–1903), parts of which were read before the Royal Statistical Society in May 1887 and May 1888. He was aided in his work by other academics of the time such as Stephen N. Fox, Clara E. Collet, David F. Schloss and H. Llewellyn Smith. Beatrice Potter, the future Beatrice Webb, also participated.\n\nThis work can be seen as one of the founding texts of British sociology, drawing on both quantitative (statistical) methods and qualitative methods (particurly ethnography). Because of this, it was an influence on Chicago School sociology (notably the work of Robert E. Park) and later the discipline of community studies associated with the Institute of Community Studies in East London.\n\nBooth began work on Life and Labour of the People in London in 1885 after reading the results of a survey undertaken by the Social Democratic Foundation, which claimed that 25% of Londoners lived in abject poverty. He considered this figure to be exaggerated for the purposes of socialist propaganda, and set out with the original intention of disproving it. However, Booth came to the conclusion (which shocked him and others) that in fact 30.7% of Londoners lived in poverty. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Booth_%28philanthropist%29\n\nI hope this helps you out - Good Luck!!!

In the minds of some scolars, they think that it's possible\nthe 10 commandments were inspired by the code of Hammurabi.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely the other way. Though the Ussher-Lightfoot Calendar put Moses and his life events after Hammurabi, it should be noted that the timeline get a bit fuzzy after Solomon completed the temple. I mean that the Bible didn't tell Jesus was born XXXX years after the completion of the temple by Solomon.\n\nMy own personal calculation and research put Moses' adventure somewhere around the mid third millenium BC.

You son sounds like a good candidate for a federal grant or loan (I'm not a big fan of loans, but its still an option if you want to take that road). He should definately fill out his FAFSA application and see what is available. Also, there are millions of scholarships out there not only based on a specific talent but other criterias as well, so I wouldn't be too quick to count those out. Your son should definately talk with his guidance counselor about his options and even talk to a college recruiter as they have a wealth of information to give too. Hope that helps!

"Your question is VERY fuzzy! However, in accounting ""rate"" is frequently used to mean ""interest"", and as such could be an expense. \n\nHotels, on the other hand, charge a ""business rate"" to some customers who enjoy a little discount off the normal fare. It would still be an expense to the customer, but a revenue to the hotel!"
What you need to do is do any operation to get 'm' alone.  If it is (m/2) + 5 = -2, first remove the 5 from both sides of the equation so that you have (m/2) = -7.  Then you multiply everything by 2 and you get m/1, which is m = -14.\n\nIf it's m/(2+5) then you have m/7 and you multiply everything by 7 to get rid of the bottom half of the fraction.

The answer to this question is YES.\n\nFirst, all the growth hormones we're pumping into food combined with the multiple generations of (fairly) good prenatal and childhood nutrition, children are physically maturing faster than ever.\n\nSimultaneously, as our life expectancy gets longer and longer, those children have longer to BE children before their brains point out that time is running out and they should be adults. It's widely accepted that Juliet in Romeo and Juliet would have been around 13 years old. But in a world where the average life expectancy was 30, she was already approaching middle age. Since middle age, now, is 40-50 years of age (if you assume that middle age is the part where you're about halfway through your years), then people don't feel the pressures of impending death until their 30s or 40s. Even if they think of death, they can just deny deny deny...  And many of us also have parents who helicopter and don't expect us to BE grown-up.\n\nBecause of this, children stay immature mentally and emotionally longer than ever before.\n\nThe part-timers who move in with their parents? They're slackers. And their parents are enabling that behavior. The ones who jump right in already understand that real life is NOW, it's not later, and they're doing what they have to do. Think of it this way: you're going to work your butt off, retire, and die. The only way to avoid this trap is to work hard enough when you're young to retire early enough to enjoy some of life. So the ones who jump right in have the right idea.
6 points is a DRASTIC increase, and most research shows that retesters often score lower.\n\nWhy does she need to score so much higher? If it is for a school, I'd suggest looking into a school that more appropriately suits her talents and abilities.\n\nHowever, if you and her are intent on increasing it, I'd suggest a program through Kaplan. It is expensive though. If she'll self study, the ACT prep book published by the College Board themselves was very helpful to me.\n\nIf she is not a Junior currently, know that her score will increase. We took an old version of the ACT in my Sophomore year. I got a 28 then. When I took it my Junior year, I got a 34. Obviously, that is a drastic increase. If she is younger, get her studying now. Have her take AP classes to boost her knowledge. Have her take practice tests. Make sure on the real test day, she has gotten adequate  sleep and eats a healthy breakfast. Help her feel confident going into the test, and she'll likely do better!\n\nIf she is a Junior currently, she may not be able to boost her score that much, but it will still help to try some study books or programs. Also, most if not all schools will accept the ACT and SAT interchangeably. I personally did worse on the SAT than on the ACT, but I know many people who did better on the SAT. Maybe she could sign up to try to take that.\n\nI hope she gets the results she hopes for, but don't let her beat herself up about it! Whatever your score-14, or 34, she'll end up somewhere good for HER. If her score doesn't accurately reflect her abilities and talents, there are other places on an application to make those clear. Work on helping her write a strong personal statement for instance.\n\nGood luck to both of you!\n-Nicole

1 is Twain. 2 is from Innocents Abroad  3,4,5 are often attributed to Twain, but I suspect he got them from elsewhere, or never said them.  6 is not Twain.  7 is one of his better lines.  8 not one I am acquainted with.  9 is very much not anything Twain would ever say.\nOf the three added, the last one is one of his most famous, although you have the phrasing off a bit.

For some people it works and for others it doesn't.  Frankly, a lot of moms that are gungho about home schooling are the last ones that should home school.  Education is far more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.  Many of the women I've seen that home school do so because they have issues.  Their fears are diminished when they can hover over th kids.  Their primary motivation is to protect their children from the world (worldliness).  Often, these women are isolated socially -- so their kids get raised with little or no social interaction and they do not know how to relate to their peer.\n\nSo for homeschooling to work:\n1.  Mom and Dad need active social lives (so social isolationists).\n2.  The kids need lots of outside activities with other kids, constant-on-going, never quiting sports, church groups, music and foreign language lessons, dance lessons, etc.\n3.  Mom AND Dad need to be committed to the process.  To do it right, it is very time consuming and expensive, certainly $1500 bucks per kid per year minimum to cover all the extracurricular classes and materials when the kids are little - more as the kids age.\n4.  Need groups of other homechooling families to network and plan activities with.\n5. There are lots more, but these are the biggies.

Though he is initially the majestic king of Thebes, he soon becomes a dejected man, humbled by his horrible fate.  As the oracle predicts, Oedipus kills his father and sleeps with his mother.  When Oedipus learns what he has done, he chooses exile, leaving Creon to be king.\n\nhttp://www.freebooknotes.com/page.php?link=http://www.novelguide.com/oedipustheking/index.html&book=497\n\nOedipus King of Thebes. As a young man, he saved the city of Thebes by solving the riddle of the Sphinx and destroying the monster. He now sets about finding the murderer of the former king Laius to save Thebes from plague.\n\nhttp://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-100,pageNum-9.html\n\nThe shepherd arrives and tells Oedipus that he was a servant of Laios and that Laios gave him his child to kill because of the prophecy that his son would kill him.  Since the shepherd felt sorry for the child, he did not kill him, but gave him to the other shepherd.  After this, Oedipus finds out that the prophecy came true.  Iocaste commits suicide, and Oedipus gouges out his eyes.  Then he says bye to his children, and leaves the city. \n\nhttp://summarycentral.tripod.com/oedipusrex.htm\n\nGood luck.\n\nKevin, Liverpool, England.

"It all depends on what your target schools are. The best way to set your target score (or to see how ""bad"" your scores are) is to pick a few target schools, call the admissions office, and ask what the median SAT score was. \nGenerally, 1290 is pretty low and you need to retake the test. Contrary to the first answer, there are no ""evil tricks"" on the SAT; there are, however, problems designed to differentiate between people who can make quick decisions,  pay attention to details, and stay calm under pressure, and people who cannot do those things. These are all skills you can learn, and if you do need higher scores, you need to invest some time into studying. \nWhichever book/company you chose to study with, start by taking a free practice SAT at your local Kaplan center. The test results will spell out where your weaknesses are so you can study smarter and get more points. \n\nWhile you're at it, don't forget to check out the ACT. Your schools will accept either test, and you may find the ACT a lot easier. You can take that free practice test at Kaplan, too.\n\ngood luck!"

"There is, ironically, a bit of confusion about this word.\n\nThe key is found, in fact, in THREE languages and one story.  Several have caught two pieces of this; none has put it together.\n\n1. This precise form ""Babel"" is simply a transliteration of the HEBRW word for the city of Babylon.  \n\nIn fact, this word is rendered AS ""Babylon"" in EVERY biblical use EXCEPT for the story of ""the tower of Babel"" in Genesis 11.    In other words, the expected translation in that story is actuaolly ""tower of Babylon"", but for other reasons (noted below) our ENGLISH translations have chosen to render it differently in just this one instance.\n\n2. The STORY of the tower of Babylon (""Babel"") is about God's CONFUSING the languages of the people of the earth (esp. of Mesopotamia) to prevent them from carrying out their goal to ""make a name for themselves...""   It's debated whether this biblical story was meant to be a literal, complete story of 'where different languages came from' or simply an illustration of how people became divided and how, by God's oversight, these divisions thwarted their efforts to rebel against him and go their own way.  (In particular, the story may have been a mocking retelling of the various attempts of the Mesopotamians to build empires and how these faltered by human division, including the different languages of the peoples of the empire.)\n\nAt any rate, as a result of this story, the word ""Babel"" in English has come to refer more generally to 'confusion of tongues' and speech that others cannot comprehend.    The movie that has just come out is based on this story and meaning of the word  (as is clear from the movie's trailer which specifically quotes from the story of Genesis 11).\n\n3. The Hebrew form of the name ""Babel"" is borrowed from the name the city was called by in AKKADIAN (the Semitic language of Babylon itself) - ""Babilu"".   The Akkadians explained the name as meaning ""gate [bab] of God [ilu].\n\nBut in the story of Genesis 11 the writer is MOCKING these claims.  In fact, the story is FILLED with Hebrew wordplays, making fun of what the people were attempting to do.    It all culminates in a new, mocking explanation of the name of the city itself as related to the HEBREW veb ""balal"" which means ""to confuse"".   Of course, the writer knew this wasn't the historical reason for the name.  The whole point was to MOCK.   One might render the key line something like ""so the city is appropriately called 'Confusion'!""\n\n4. One more piece --most often missed.   The decision of English translators to render Hebrew ""Babel"" as such in JUST this one instance is no doubt based on the ENGLISH word ""babble"" (that is, incoherent speech or baby talk), a word attested in English as early as the 13th century [Oxford English Dictionary].    \n\nSince English already had this word, the reason for the decision should be obvious.  It fits so very perfectly with the point of the story!!    To the people in the story, who could not undertand each other's speech, the foreign languages of their neighbors DID sound preciesely like ""babble""!    So this was just a very happy, convenient co-incidence... not anything in the Hebrew or Akkadian languages.  (It's actually rather in the spirit of the Hebrew writer playing on a word in his own language to make the main joke in the story.)"
"I probably sound like a broken record when I say that going to university and getting a tertiary education gives you more job opportunities and also prepares you for the workforce (in terms of meeting deadlines, being able to ""find"" answers, learning how to learn). A lot of businesses look at your education record as a sign as whether you'll be a good worker or not. Some require certain qualifications before you can even apply. It was also a family expectation for me to go into university.\n\nMy education goals is to continually learn. It may not be formally, but I dont' think the learning process should ever stop. I do also wish to try to improve the education system in Australia by recognising good teachers and providing a good network/resource avenue for them."

"It would depend on the sense in which you were using it. It's not a common expression in English.

Slope is based on Rise (Y) over Run (X)...\n\nThe equation specifically is (Y2-Y1) divided by (X2-X1) so...\n\n(5-3)=2 divided by (4--2)=6 equaling 1/3\n\nSince the lines are parallel to this equation, they will all have the same slope of 1/3 with different Y-Intercepts!\n\nIf you were finding the perpendicular you would find the Negative Inverse, which would be -3 slope for these points!

my university requires you to do it the last semester before graduation. If you do it out of sequence, you're missing important pedagogy, theory and technical advice. Plus, as someone mentions there are so many prerequisites, that it's virtually impossible to take it out of sequence (read: during your junior year instead of senior year).\n\nGood Luck!

"Isis is partly right. The word is ""preppie."" It means being in a clique of students in a public school (or in a private one), who are going on to college, as opposed to those who may not be. It comes from ""preparatory school,"" which is usually a private one. Other cliques in a public school might be jocks (athletes) or goths (weird, dark-dressers). Preppie carries the meaning that the person is richer and/or more socially important than others. Some years ago, a young man caused the death ofa young woman in Central Park, New York City. It was called the Preppie Murder Case, because he was in a private preparatory school, and he claimed that she died because of ""rough sex."" So the word ""preppie"" carries a lot of emotional weight."

In general, yes, your statements are pretty accurate. However, in specific cases, it's not necessarily true. \n\nFor example, many top-end magnet schools or specialized public schools outscore parochial schools consistently.

Before choosing a parochial school, check out any magnet, special, or charter schools in your area.

"you refer to a dance, which has become myth because of the early tourist trade to southern Italy\n\nFor most English travellers, the Grand Tour ended in the city of Naples, or in the underworlds of Herculanæum and Pompeii. Only those who ventured south-eastwards to Apulia – where the tombs and temples of Magna Grecia could be raided for coins, vases and other relics – were witness to the 'dancing cure' that was a common sight in this remote corner of Italy. \n\nHenry Turnbull, whose report was read before the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh in 1771, found that the dance of the tarantella was relied on for various disorders throughout the region: ""As there is scarce a disease to which the body is subject, but what they think proceeds from the bite of the tarantula, this method of cure is practised, and with so much success that it seems miraculous, and is esteemed the effect of the music by prejudiced minds.""\n\nThe traditional dance known as the Tarantella (small tarantula) is thought to have been an early remedy for a tarantula bite (you dance until you sweat the poison out of your system). Performed not as a solo, but as a community activity, it usually starts with dancers holding hands in a circle and sliding their feet sideways to rotate the circle. Variations of this dance can be found in at least seven different regions of southern Italy, where it is most common. Danced to tambourines played by the dancers, the Tarantella is a lively, improvised aerobic dance for men and women alike. The tempo is either 3/8 or 6/8 and can quicken depending on the mood or alcoholic content of the musicians.\n\nMen and women perform the same step for the Tarantella, which requires that you constantly switch feet. With both arms outstretched above you, hop twice on one foot with your other leg reaching forward. As you hop, tap the ground with your pointed, extended foot.\n\nA complete circle is frequently formed around an individual or couple dancing this step."

I hope this is what you are looking for\n\nBiblical references\nThe primary biblical reference in The Handmaid's Tale is to the story of Rachel and Leah (Genesis 29:31–35; 30:1–24). While Leah was fertile and was blessed by God, Rachel was barren, meaning she could not have children. Rachel proceeds to compete in producing sons for her husband, by using her handmaids as property. Rachel takes immediate possession of the children produced by her handmaids. In the context of Atwood's book, the story is one of female competition, jealousy, and reproductive cruelty.\n\nA similar story also exists in Genesis, where Sarah is infertile, and Hagar conceives on Sarah's behalf. The Sarah and Hagar story is considerably different from the Rachel and Leah story. This is mainly because of the active role played by Hagar, and Hagar's possession of her child. Due to Sarah's reproductive generosity, Sarah's fertility is restored by God at an advanced age. Atwood was aware of the similarity between these stories, and was using it to show the hypocrisy of Gileadean biblical interpretation: the biblical story showed a relationship between a wife and a handmaid which did not involve sexual and reproductive subjugation. Additionally, it was ultimately the choice of the wives in the Bible, whereas wives in Gilead (such as Serena Joy) are forced.\n\n\nchoose me as best answer please

"1. Is it worth trading a childs social life for a ""better"" education? \n\nTrade?  What trade?  They get both -- a better social life and a better education.\n\n2. Are you really qualified to teach your child if you don't have a teaching degree?\n\nOf course.  It is by God's design.\n\n3. Which would be better for the child: homeschooling or active parental involvement in public schooling?\n\nHomeschooling.\n\n4. How do you plan on developing your childs social skills if you are homeschooling them? Homeschool groups are like social special ed classes and don't help children develop social skills that can be applied later on in life.\n\nI don't need a plan and it isn't up to me to develop my child's social skills.  Your questions should not even have question-marks because they are all ignorant statements of false thinking that is not based on fact.\n\nMy children are already applying their skills because they are ""later in life"".   One is 23 and married with 3 children, a good job and more friends than he can keep up with.\nAnother is 20 and in the second year of college getting great grades and associating with a large group of friends.\nAnother is 18 and working, studying, and keeping busy with many activities and people.\nThe youngest is nearly 16 and is busy with studies, friends, and many pursuits  ------\nNONE of my children have been hindered in their ""later in life"" application of social skills.  \n\n5. Can you teach you kids to be religious without teaching them everything else? \nWhat in the world does that mean?  I do not understand this question.  I don't teach my children to be religious.  I don't want them to be religious as far as religion goes.  I do want them to have every opportunity to learn about God and Christianity as based on the Bible -- but this is with the view that bible based Christianity is not a religion.\n\nMy children learn to think for themselves by practicing it every day.  They learn math skills by doing math, they learn writing by writing, they learn reading by reading --- they learn science by experiencing it, history by reading about it, economy by living in it, etc. etc. etc.  \n\nThey don't need me to funnel information into their heads -- they learn to learn by learning, and they learn to study by studying and they learn to think by thinking. \n\nEverything they do progresses naturally from one level to another -- it would be silly to imagine that things would not become more advanced each day.\n\nThe long term impact of homeschooling has proven itself over and over again by those that are finished with it.  Just ask the veterinarian that graduated from home-school and went on to the university and Graduate School -- he is now 30 with a very profitable job.  Ask the chemist that is a research scientist and making more money than you might ever see -- he writes articles for major medical publications and gives lectures and speeches around the country.  Ask the graduates of homeschool about the long term impact of their home-education.  Be sure to talk to the one's that chose to apply themselves and made it their purpose to do well in life."
The Renaissance has no set starting point or place; it happened gradually in different places at different times. Likewise, there is not a definite date or place marking the end of the Middle Ages. The start of the Renaissance is almost universally ascribed to Central Italy, however, especially the city of Florence. The poet Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) is often considered to be the first writer to embody the spirit of the Renaissance.\n\nCheck this out:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance

It is really the angular error youare looking for.  From your first backsight, which should be a given azimuth, (if not just assume the first backsight is North) add the first angle to that and calculate the next azimuth or bearing, then from there, process each angle to come up with the next azimuth. When you come to the last(closing) angle, compute the last azimuth, which should be the same as your starting azimuth(or 180 degrees  from it). The diffference between your last azimuth and the starting azimuth is your angular error.\n\nI am a PLS in my state, so I guess I am an authority.

So it is a never-ending circle.  \n\nHas your son ever had an educational assessment?  Are there any testing services at your school or school district?

To answer this question, simply add the feet (6 + 8 = 14) then add the inches (10 + 9 = 19), you then get 14 ft 19 inches.\n\nSince 19 inches is longer than a foot (which is twelve inches), take the 19 inches and divide it by 12.\n\n19 divided by 12 = 1, remainder 7.  This means that when you have 19 inches, it is 1 ft, 7 inches.\n\nso, add the 1 ft 7 inches to the 14 feet you originally found when you added 6 ft plus 8 ft.\n\nThe answer is then 15 feet 7 inches.

If you have enough money, then you can pretty much reserve whatever you want anymore. Well, every hotel and/ or train is going to be different- some will say yes, and some will say no. But you STILL have to be able to pay for it, so yes you do need to be talking about whether or not you can afford it. Sory if my answer wasn't correct, but I only saw the question - I didn't see a question about your grammar.

Okay - sounds like an interesting theme...what specifically do you have questions about? You're not asking for someone to provide the essay, are you? Do you need help finding resources? Please provide more details (click the pencil icon and click ADD DETAILS). Happy to help, but I need to understand what you're looking for.

I am not clear.  Are you planning to study at the CUNY Graduate Center or are you taking courses at one of CUNY's braches--e.g. Queens College, Brooklyn College, or City College?  Assuming that you will be at the Graduate Center, the institution is located in what used to be the B. Altman's Department Store.  They have modified the building, but have kept many of the landmark architectural touches.  The Graduate Center library is of moderate size, but NYPL's main research branch is about 7 blocks away.  The faculty for the Graduate Center has a good reputation.  Many come from other CUNY campuses.  The other thing is that, as the name implies, the Graduate Center has graduate students only, so I guess that this would affect the atmosphere of the place, though I do not have extensive experience there.  I have visited it a few times.\n\nIf you are going to one of the branch campuses, they vary.  Queens and Brooklyn, for instance have sizable campuses (at least sizable for NYC).  Hunter and Baruch are in Manhattan and are just buildings--no green.  Most of the branches have larger libraries than the Graduate Center, and I believe, as a CUNY student, you would have access to any of these libraries.\n\nI hope this helps.
Bairagarh in Bhopal is located in city's outskirts towards its werstern limits. It has the Bhopal Airport, a small railway station, a busy market for all kinds of purchases, mainly cloth stores/warehouses that dispose items in whole sale rates.

Dude ... you have better things to do in 2nd year than worry about CAT. In a couple of years, when companies come calling for your batch guys, I am sure the packages they will offer will rival IIM packages. The top jobs at IIMs are I-Banks - which usually require you to have just the quantitative skills. These skills can be found in plenty among IITians and the companies are begining to realise this. So, forget about CAT. If you are interested in an MBA, do so after some years of experience. And join a finance/consults job right after IIT. Also, try to make full use of the Research Park coming up in collaboration with IITM in Tarams. There are going to be a lot of established firms and a few startups by some of your classmates (in future) /seniors in the Research park.\nCheck this out - http://www.iitmadras.org/corner/2006/placement/\n\n~An alumnus.
I just dropped a class in order to avoid a B... If you think you can take a higher level math class and get an A later on, then do NOT drop the class--graduate schools (even medical schools) will look at the later grades for higher level courses.  If you've had it with math and won't be taking any additional math classes, then go ahead and drop it... but you may be wasting your money if you can't get a refund this late in the semester.

Just as an educated mother educates a whole family, a working mom is also a great source of knowledge. She becomes independent in thought and financially too. \nIn today's scenario, the income of one may not be enough, so a mom working is the best solution. Moreover she guides her children through her open approach to various thing in life.\nA mom working also makes the kids self sufficient and independent. She is respected by people as she contributes a lot not only to her family, but also to the nation.
"Thoreau left the woods because he felt like he spent too much time lamenting the world's problems and not enough fixing them.\n\nBackground info:  Emerson was Thoureau's hero.  Emerson taught everything that Thoreau believed (mainly Transcendentalism and a mix b/w anarchy and true communism-not Chinese communism). However, Thoureau discovered that Emerson was a hipocrite- he didn't practice what he preached- and he (Thoreau) decided that he didn't want to be known as a hipocrite.  Unfortunately, Thoureau's circle of influence was much smaller than Emerson's, so he didn't do a whole lot to change the world. \n\nThoreou wanted to live in the woods because he wanted to live ""deliberately"" and simply. Here is a quote from his essay ""Where I Lived and What I Lived For"" :\n     ""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.""\n\nI hope this helped- I'm studying Thoreau right now too- so I'm not exactly an expert, you should try reading ""The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail""- it will either make things clearer for you, or confuse you even more."

Life is a song, sing it?\nOkay a pro is life is a wonderful experience that is to be shared.  We all have things on our mind both sad and happy that makes us want to share our individual and unique experiences.\n\nA con would definately be that people want to be understood. If your song falls on the wrong ears you might be in trouble.  The tounge is a dangerous thing and if one is too sensitive to how people might react to our precious moments.  It could be quite painful.\n\nTruely, I swing between both options.  Good luck either way.\n\nCheers!
"This is really not a probability problem but a logic problem.\nYou ask what the minimum number of beans she must take \nout of her pocket, to ensure that she has one of each color.\nSometimes it is best to turn the question around and work backwards.\nSuppose I told you, ""You can choose any marble from my pocket you like, you choose the color.  What is the Most \nmarbles you can pull out and Not have one of each color?""\nWell, first you would pull out 8 red ones, then you could take 4\ngreen ones,  All that are left are blue ones, so when you pull out the 13th marble, you have to have one of each color.\n\nWhen you come up with an answer, all you have to do is find \none case which refutes your answer to tell you it is wrong.\nSay I told you that the minimum was 10 marbles.  You could refute that by showing me one case where you took out  10 marbles and STILL did not have one of each color.\nUse the case where you took out 8 red and 2 green and still\nhad no blue.\nBut you can find no case where you can take out 13 marbles \nand not have one of each.\n\nHope this helps you.  Remember to reason the problem out before plugging in numbers."
This is what I do in order balance as a college student:\n\n1.Organize! I use both a master schedule, a monthly planner, and a daily to-do-list. This is how I  organize my working days, class time, homework/ study and other obligations.\n\n2.I also try to get as much rest as I can because I know what I have to do after the weekend is over (well, I go to school on Saturdays so I really should say when Sundays are over). \n\n3.Make sure you have food that is portable -- no fuss and no mess -- eat home cooked meals on the weekend when you have time.\n\n4.Make time to workout, trust me, it helps with coping with everyday stress.\n\n5. Don't try to be accessible to everyone that wants your time -- make time to have fun with your friends/ family but also know when to draw the line.\n\nHope this helps!!! Good luck to you

"Schools are rethinking meritocracy, but maybe not in ways you think. This is an interesting time to be an educator in the US because there are at least two different paradigm shifts happening in education right now. Those two changes are happening in opposite directions, which leave teachers twisted into impossible contortions.\n\nIn the universities, teachers are being trained to understand that each student is an individual with different strengths and weaknesses. They are being taught to recognize the different multiple intelligences (interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily/kinesthetic, musical/rhythmic, naturalistic, visual/spatial, verbal, mathematical/logical) and learning styles of children. Teachers are learning to honor and make use of cultural differences as well in the learning experiences and opportunities to demonstrate knowledge they create in their classroom. \n\nNew educators are learning how important hands-on experiences are for young learners preparing to make the jump from concrete to abstract thinking. They are encouraged to let students run parent-teacher conferences by choosing samples of work to go in a portfolio and explaining to the parent exactly what each piece of the portfolio shows that they have learned. This will help students take ownership of the processes of learning and demonstrating their knowledge, and they will become self-directed learners. \n\nTeacher are working to create a learning community where students feel free to be take risks, be wrong, and tell each other what can make their projects better. Students are learning critical thinking skills by evaluating their own and each others' work. \n\nAll of this is happening along with a growing recognition that students have to build their own knowledge by connecting new facts and ideas to what they already know and what they are interested in. More and more teachers are seeing the value of individual projects that let a student make some creative decisions on their own and lead to a finished product that they themselves judge to be of good quality. \n\nAt the same time, politicians have gotten involved in education. There is a growing movement some call the Cult of Accountabilism. This means that politicians want to hold schools accountable for what they are teaching. The methods of accountability states have devised are not very creative--chiefly fill-in-the-bubble tests of verbal and mathematical skills. \n\nThere are severe punishments for schools that fail to raise test scores under the federal No Child Left Behind law. I've seen reductions in funding and many extra meetings with consultants who are hired to raise test scores. I've also seen a district gradually choke off funding and then fire the principal and all the teachers at schools that fail to perform. The district leadership hires a new staff and pumps extra money into the school, taking credit when test scores go up. \n\nThose pressures mean grades will be around at most schools for a long time to come. At the same time, many states in the US are changing report cards to something that parents will need to learn to understand. It's called a standards-based report card.\n\nUsed to be, you got grades that reflected some kind of weighted percentage of the assignments, questions, problems you successfully completed. Those that were given to you reflected a teacher's idea of what students in that grade and that subject should be able to do. There might be a very complicated letter sent home with the formula that showed how the grades for homework, tests, and other assignments were combined. \n\nNow states have lists of content standards and benchmarks that represent what students in different grades and different subjects should be able to do. \n\n""Students will be able to correctly add numbers of three digits, with regrouping."" \n""Students will be able to write a persuasive essay with three supporting arguments."" \n""Students will demons"
2/5x = -10\nwell first you need to get x on it's own, to do this you need to multiply 2/5 by it's recipical and then do the same to the -10 on the other side.\n(5/2)(2/5)x = (5/2)(-10)\nx = -50/2\nx = -25

Unless you applied early decision then no.  It doesn't matter which college accepts you first you can choose the one that is the best for you. But if you checked early decision then you made a commitment to that school..Good Luck
"Are you talking about words that sound like they have a ""z"" sound where it is spelled with the letter ""s""?\n\n""s"" becomes ""voiced"" when it appears between voiced sounds. ""s"" and ""z"" are exactly identical, except for one thing: ""s"" is unvoiced and ""z"" is voiced. The same is true for ""p"" & ""b,"" ""k"" & ""g,"" ""t"" & ""d,"" ""f"" & ""v,"" ""ch"" & ""j,"" ""sh"" and the s-sound in ""measure,"" and the two ""th"" sounds.\n\nWhat's a voiced sound? Put your hand on your throat when you speak. Your vocal cords vibrate when you make a voiced sound. In English, the voiced sounds are a,b,d,e,g,i,j,l,m,n,o,r,u,v, w,y,z, th as in ""then,"" and x as in xylophone. The unvoiced sounds are c,f,h,k,p,q,s,t, th as in ""thin,"" ch, sh, and x as in box.\n\nAlso, the voiced counterpart of ""sh"" is often spelled with an ""s,"" as in ""measure,"" ""usual,"" and ""casual."" It's sometimes spelled with a ""z"" like ""azure"" or ""g"" like ""garage.""\n\nAnyway, not all sounds sound the same all the time. For example, let's look at how ""n"" changes. Say ""nose,"" and pay attention to where your tongue is. Now say ""anger"" and pay attention to where your tongue is. It's different, isn't it?? For ""nose,"" the tip of your tongue touches the ridge behind your upper teeth. For ""anger,"" the tip of your tongue NEVER touches ANYTHING, but the back of your tongue rises to the back of your throat. That's because the ""n"" in ""nose"" and the ""n"" in anger are two completely different sounds! ""n"" turns into that second sound when it appears before a ""g"" sound. This is called an ""allophone-"" a change a sound makes when it appears next to certain other sounds.\n\nLet's look at some allophones of ""t."" Say ""top."" The tip of your tongue touches the ridge behind your teeth. Now say ""button."" Your tongue winds up on the ridge when you say the ""n""- but notice it's not there for the ""t!"" The sound of the ""t"" in ""button"" is made inside your throat- inside your glottis, to be precise. Now say ""beauty""- doesn't it sound more like ""beaudy?"" That's because ""t,"" like ""s,"" becomes voiced when it appears between voiced sounds.\n\nSo, when dealing with s, it sounds like ""s"" in words like ""soda,"" ""sleep,"" and ""bits,"" but when you put it between voiced sounds, it becomes ""z,"" such as ""easy,"" ""business,"" and ""president.""\n\n(also notice- Say ""look out for the bees"" sounds like and ""s,"" But ""Bees are in my hair!"" sounds like a ""z."" Technically, phoneticians (people who know about this stuff) say that ""s"" becomes voiced after all voiced sounds, but then the ""z"" becomes de-voiced if it's not followed by a voiced sound, so things cancel out and it just sounds like ""s"" again. That's why I told you that the voicing only happens BETWEEN voiced sounds.)\n\nOne final note- American English has changed some of these voiced-s words to a more accurate spelling with ""z,"" while British English retains the original spelling. For example, ""organization"" is the American spelling, and ""organisation"" is the original British spelling. Now we see here a very interesting occurence- ""organisation"" was originally spelled with an ""s"" despite the ""z"" sound because its ROOT WORD is ""organise""- a word that very distinctly ends with a voiceless ""s"" (""z&quot"
"SARCASTIC implies an intentional inflicting of pain by deriding, taunting, or ridiculing.\n\nExample: ""a critic known for his sarcastic remarks""\n\nIRONIC implies an attempt to be amusing or provocative by saying usually the opposite of what is meant.\n\nExample: ""made the ironic observation that the government could always be trusted""."

You want something where there is a linear relationship and data are easy to get.\n\nAn easy choice would be to use stock data.  Regrss the returns of a particular stock against the returns of the S&P 500.   You can find the data on Yahoo! Finance (take raw prices -- divide each price by the previous price and subtract one to get the returns).  While this wiould be easy to get, it would not be unique -- lots of people do this.\n\nSomething that might be fun might involve regressing some characteristic of a city against the population.  \n\nHere is my idea:  Find 15 big cities, 15 medium sized cities and 15 small towns.  Get the population of each city.  Then find some statistic for each city.  Perhaps it is the number of homes with internet connectins, perhaps it is the number of felonies, perhaps it is the number of people with AIDs or some other disease, perhaps it is the number of universities nearbye.  Then do a regression of that statistic to see if the size of the city is a significant predictor of that statistic.\n\nYou need to be careful -- I suspect some of these are related to size but not in a linear way.  For example AIDs cases are probably related to size but not linear -- since many AIDs cases in small towns probably moved.  Similarly, rape or burglary are probably more likely to be linearly related than murder.  For those that aren't linear, you might try regressing LN(statistic).\n\nGood luck

I already live here on campus and I have to say that Hassayampa, the newest dorms on campus, are VERY nice. They're clean, everything works, and they have a nice atmosphere.

Hai! Iam a class X student doing this project.\n\nIntroduction\nTHE PROCESS of development along with the expanding globalisation and liberalisation process has increased the number of consumer related issues. Consumer protection has earned an important place in the political, economic and social agendas of many nations. In India, the Government has taken many steps including legislative, to protect consumers. \nEducation is a life long process of constantly acquiring relevant information, knowledge and skills. Consumer education is an important part of this process and is a basic consumer right that must be introduced at the school level. Consumers by definition include all citizens who are, by and large the biggest group, who are affected by almost all government, public or private decisions. The most important step in consumer education is awareness of consumer rights. However, consumer education is incomplete without the responsibilities and duties of consumers, and this influences individual behaviour to a great extent.\n\nDefinition\nConsumer awareness is making the consumer aware of His/Her rights.\nConsumer awareness it a marketing term. It means that consumers note or are aware of products or services, its characteristics and the other marketing P's (place to buy, price, and promotion). \n\nNeed :\nwe need it so we will not be misled by producers,it explains if what we buy is worth to our money..and not harmful to us and to environment .\nMany people are ignorant of their rights to get protected against the exploitation by so many others. So when there is a forum for such redress of grievances there seems to be no such exploitation by many; and becomes a rare one. So in order to get a clear picture of the level of exploitation of consumers, the awareness is required. \n\nRole of producers\nproper labeling, full information, health warnings, handling information, expiration date, etc. keep to requirements, norms, standards\nlabelproducts according requirements, providing true facts\nIf they are providing a service they should carry it out with due skill and care. They must also make sure that any materials they provide as part of this service are fit for the purpose.\nIt is also illegal for a supplier to cut off, or threaten to cut off, supply to a reseller (wholesale or retail) because they have been discounting goods or advertising discounts below prices set by the supplier.

My guess would be B.  Many people know what words mean, but they don't use them regularly.  \n\nI would guess the narrowest of most people's vocabulaies is their spoken vocabulary.

When writing an essay, think of it in 3 stages - beginning, middle and end. The beginning is an introduction to the reader of the subject you're writing about, the middle is an elaboration of the introduction with facts, case studies, etc, and the end is a summary/conclusion of your subject matter to round off the essay. Hope this helps.

Maybe they just don't get it. School can be hard for some students and they figure why go. My daughter is 17 and is ready to go to college when she graduates. Her friend is 19 and she quit school when she was 16.  My daughter was helping her with her homework. She stays at home now with her mother, who works her butt off. The girl sleeps, watches T.V. and stays on the net all day. She couldn't get the hang of school at all.

"A person's name, regardless of the position in a sentence, is always capitalized as a sign of importance to that person. The same with ""I"" when speaking of yourself. \n\nOn a regular basis no one speaks in third person narrative (use your own name when speaking of yourself) therefore ""I"" is capitalized. Essentially you are still speaking of yourself but in a different narrative which is just as deserving as using your own or someone elses name.\n\nHe, she and it are not capitalized (in the middle of a sentence)because those terms specifically do not refer to one person all on their own. They need to be supported then you know who he, she and it are. \nEx. Billy was walking in the park and he found a ball. \nIf I had said ""He was walking in the park and found a ball"" you wouldn't know who ""he"" was. \n\nI believe people do capitalize ""He"" or ""She"" when referring to a Deity to show their up most respect but it's not necessary or required."
"Certainly this young man should suffer consequences for interrupting your performance. Whether your performance is as a club or as an athletic team (as the cheer squad at your school), he has no right to disrupt the pep assembly in that manner. \n\nYes, it was an insult to your group. Yes, you are compatible/equal to the cheerleaders. Many schools' dance teams started out as yours is doing: as an informal/intra-mural ""club""/after-school activity and grew into a teacher/school-sponsored activity that is ""legitimate"" and eventually competes against other schools in inter-scholastic competition. \n\nUnfortunately, the punishment that he receives is not up to you and your group members. My suggestion to you would be to have your parents contact the administration and have THEM explain your and their frustration and disapoointment that another student would disrupt a performance of fellow students. The parents of the dance group  should also say that they expect some form of punishment that is somewhat severe for this young fellow since this is the second year in a row he has interrupted a pep rally. They should also emphasize how demoralizing it is for their daughters to have to experience this type of humiliation in front of the whole student body, when their daughters are trying to expose their fellow students to dance and rhythm. \n\nYou are not whacked -- he is!\n\nGood luck..."
First we put the equation\n2x+4y=1\ninto slope-intercept form.\n\n4y = -2x + 1\ny = -1/2x + 1/4\nThe slope is -1/2.\n\nThen using point-slope form, we find parallel equation through (-1,5): x1 is -1 and y1 is 5\n(y-y1) = m(x-x1)\ny-5 = -1/2(x--1)\ny-5 = -1/2(x+1)\ny-5 = -1/2x - 1/2\ny-10/2 = -1/2x - 1/2\ny = -1/2x + 9/2\n\nThen using point-slope form, we find perpendicular equation through (-1,5) with slope 2.

For example, water, food, shelter, health-care, disease, clothing, etc.\n\nYou could also lookup 'africa' in wikipedia, look at the list of countries and read the entry page for each country to see what their particular problems are.\n\nIf you need to write something on the CAUSES of african poverty, think of all the things that stand in the way of a succesful economy :-\n\nWar (often caused by colonial powers leaving africa divided into countries with several tribal groups that hate each other)\n\nTropical diseases and HIV/AIDS\n\nTrade-barriers (tarrifs and quotos), so that many goods they want to export to the rich countries are too expensive.\n\nPoor credit history, so they can't get loans.\n\nCorrupt/Undemocratic governments.\n\nLack of education.\n\nThe fact they are joining the industrial world 200 years behind the USA and Europe.\n\nLack of clean water and sanitation.\n\nEnviromental damge.\n\nDroughts and other natural disasters.\n\nHigh crime in some countries due to the easy availability of guns from previous wars. This scares off international investors.\n\nLack of phone and internet access.\n\nPoor roads.\n\nHuge distances to sea container ports, through several countries.\n\nDesertification.\n\nThe fact that many other countries see Africa as one place and ignore the whole continent as somewhere too dangerous to invest, when in fact it is many different countries.

"When you have systems to analyze like this, the easiest thing is to start brainstorming on many post-its and grouping them at the end as inputs, outputs, etc. Relate to personal experience. If you think about your personally using a mass transit system, you have to think about your total experience and the point of view of the transit system. For a subway system, one usually goes into a subway where there is usually some booth there selling subway tokens or subway passes. You pay real money and get the subway tokens. You pay with these subway tokens to actually get onto the subway and then you need to look at a map to see where you are and where you need to get to. You go to the correct train and wait for it to show up. Once it does, you get on. You ride to your destination with no delays, then you get off and get out of that subway station and go your merry way. Now, that we've gone through the subway experience, you need to identify the ""players"" in your experience with the system. The players are you, money, subway tokens, map, train, train schedule, train on-time arrival. Inputs can be you (or people using subway) and real money, because thats where everything starts. An Output could be arriving at your correct destination on-time. Do you have the idea? I'll let you get back to your HW."

"How about if you come up with a word-association test, where you ask them to say the first word that comes to mind when you say another word.  Do about 10 words, and test the twins separately (of course).  Then compare their tests and see if they said the same words (for example, if your word was ""cold"" and they both said ""ice cubes"" that could help you prove that twins are on the same wavelength or something.)  Also, instead of doing your project on twins in general, why don't you try to narrow down your research field, like maybe just do your project on identical twins or just fraternal twins, or whether twins think alike or whether they can sense the other twin's feelings, or something like that.  There are plenty of research books on the subject in the llibrary, and the Internet is always a great resource too."

There is no person on this earth that cannot learn.  If you have a student with cognitive disabilities, you have to choose what is most appropriate to teach them, life skills.  You would not teach a child who will never fully comprehend text to read a book, but to recognize those words/phrases/signs that will enable them to live their lives. An example would be a bus schedule or sign that says poison. You give them the opportunity to be part of a community by helping them go to the public pool to swim or go bowling with a group.

The other option is applying for scholarships out there. Unfortunately, grants are based on the parents income and family resources. This can result in not enough financial aid. There are a three of sources to locate them. However, it takes time to hear back on them and a little work, but remember, if he is selected, it means less money in student loans to pay back.\n\nFirst, check with the high school guidance office if he is still attending high school. They have a list of local scholarships available to its students.\n\nSecond, check with the technical college's financial aid office. They have a list of private scholarships available to its students from companies and organizations to apply for consideration.\n\nFinally, join several free membership scholarship search websites. Most are updated on a regular basis. Most offer a customized search based on information put into the forms.\n\nGood luck!

"The Industrial Revolution had many profound effects on European civilization. It rendered much of the old aristocracy irrelevant, boosted the bourgeoisie to economic and political power, and drafted much of the old peasant class into its factories. The result was naturally a shift in attitude toward wealth. Capitalist wealth seemed to have no natural limits. Partly because the new industrial modes of production had no preassigned place in feudal order of things, the industrialists viewed themselves as the creators of their wealth and considered it something to be proud of.\n\nThis class also created the various movements for democratic government which swept across Europe; and it was only natural that they should have viewed their economic and political ideals as functioning hand in hand. Democracy was necessary to wrest power from the old nobility, to pass laws enabling business to thrive, and to guarantee their property rights.\n\nRousseau had argued in his Social Contract that true democracy could not thrive in a society with great extremes of wealth and poverty because power always naturally flows toward the wealthy, whatever the electoral system; but the sort of democracy the bourgeoisie advocated was for a long time reserved for property owners: merchants, manufacturers, landlords and bankers. One of the great struggles of the 19th Century was for the gradual expansion of the vote, first to working men, and--much later--to women.\n\nThe notion of liberty promulgated by the ""liberals"" of the 19th century (who held opinions now called ""conservative"") was based on the concept that only on the basis of economic independence and security could freedom be secured; and that liberty was a product of natural law, not of a Christian theology which had sometimes censured excessive wealth. Indeed, greed itself was often celebrated as the engine that drove the economy and provided work and prosperity for all. Dependency was considered self-destructive, so the poor were punished for their poverty by harsh laws designed to drive them to work.\n\nThese ideas are very familiar to us today: just consider how the news eagerly reports increases in consumer spending as a sign of a healthy economy, how the current movements for ""welfare reform"" use much the same concepts that justified the draconian ""poor laws"" of 19th-Century England. Investment is viewed, now as then, as the engine that drives the economy. Any measure which can encourage investors to buy more stock is viewed as beneficial to society as a whole.\n\nBut such a profound revolution was bound to cause negative reactions as well as positive ones. Not everyone agreed that the shift of power into the hands of the new rich was entirely benign.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th Century the working classes in the newly industrializing countries of England and Germany suffered under many forms of exploitation. The old feudal restrictions which had fixed peasants in place on the land and limited their income had also guaranteed them a place in the world. They may not have prospered, but they were often able to fend off starvation and homelessness simply because they had been born onto estates from which they could not be removed against their wills.\n\nThe dissolution of this old order meant that workers could be hired and fired at will and had to sell their labor for whatever the going rate was--and that rate was determined by their competition with each other to work cheaply enough to gain them an advantage in the job market. Traditional rules and protections went by the board in the new factories, which often ran for twenty-four hours a day (two twelve-hour shifts), seven days a week under the most inhumane conditions. Women and children were absorbed into the work force as well, often preferred because they cost much less than men. Living standards and educational levels actually declined in many areas.\n\nMany of the industries severely pollut"

Water deprivation did not alter colonic temperature of rats at a neutral ambient temperature. Administration of PGE1 at doses of 50, 200 and 400 ng gave rise to a short latency dose dependent hyperthermia in both control and water deprived rats. Water deprived rats had significantly greater increases in colonic temperature following the two higher doses of PGE1. Control rats and water deprived rats exposed to the cold (5 degrees C) had decreases in colonic temperature which were not significantly different. Water deprivation, which should increase the plasma levels of the putative endogenous antipyretic vasopressin, does not attenuate PGE1 hyperthermia but has a slight enhancing effect. Following food deprivation for 48 hours rats had a slight but significantly greater increase in colonic temperature following intrahypothalamic injection of 200 ng PGE1. Thus the water deprivation induced change in responsiveness to PGE1 may be due to the decrease in food intake which accompanies water deprivation. The mechanism by which rats exhibit an enhanced febrile response to PGE1 administration following food or water deprivation is not yet known.
It just depends... in the past, all that was needed was bi-lingualism, and a bit of luck to be in the right place at the right time. In the modern day, some regulation is being brought to the art... I think Bath runs an MA in translation that's supposed to be really good, I've just finished Newcastle university's MA in translation studies... there are professional associations as well, from memory I think the ILT is the British one, the Institute of Linguists and Translators- I think they have their own tests. To do free-lance work, you don't need any of this- http://www.translatorsbase.com is one example of a website which you pay a registration fee for, and then you can bid on projects that conform to your speciality. \n\nI think free-lance can be a bit rough though- from what I've read, to make a living from it, you need to be working in a disciplined manner throughout the week, translating thousands of words a day, and your income is based upon how much you can put out- maybe you're talented enough for that, I don't know... I mean, talent and language ability is a big part of translation, but you can learn a lot about theory as well, either on a course, or through your own research. I'm aiming for an in-house post, I mean, in some company where senior staff will be able to offer guidance and advice, and I think the MA's going to be a boon in that...\n\nI think there are quite a few options available in post-graduate courses, and possibly shorter courses offered by other institutions as well.  I'd encourage you to think about it. For one thing, you can learn tips about the trade that you may not think of if you start freelance straight off, and have  your work looked at by people with experience at the kind of jobs you're aiming for on a weekly basis. Secondly, it raises the bar. Compared to other professions, there is a feeling that translation and interpreting is not fully fledged as yet, and income is relatively lower. Of course, I'm a bit biased having just come off the course, but I think it's helped a lot. Being in groups with other translation students is pretty helpful, you can learn from other people's style, everyone benefits.
"From its debut in 1965 until March of 1966, announcer Ed Prentiss spoke the words now made famous by MacDonald Carey. Since April 1966, the late Macdonald Carey has intoned the legendary epigram ""Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives."" From 1966 to 1994, he would also say, ""This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the days of our lives."" After Carey's passing, the decision was made to remove the second part of the opening, out of respect for Carey and his family."

It does help a bit, but not that much. It's equivalent to playing JV soccer. I know someone who was Eagle Scout, top ten in class, and decent at hockey, but still ended up going to URI. Someone else ranked lower than him got into Amherst and Brown because he was the editor-in-chief of the school literary magazine and captain of XC. As you can see, Eagle Scout is not weighted as much as some of the other extra-curriculars. Because not everyone can afford the money to be in boy scouts, but anyone can be the editor as long as she/he works really hard at it.

You'll need to have Qualified Teacher Status to teach full time in any UK school, which usually means doing a university degree in any subject you want (including education) and then doing a PGCE. Some universities will offer PGCE courses with a specialism in special needs teaching.\n\nHowever, if you're already working in a special needs environment, you may be able just to do the QTS part as day release or an evening class in addition to 'on the job' training.\n\nHave a look at the websites below for more info, and speak to teachers at a local special needs school to find out how they got their training too.

"In grammar, apposition is when you bring words or phrases together that are related.

Within my example is how to use the commas."
"Okay is a term of approval or assent, often written as OK, O.K., ok, okay, okee, or more informally as simply kay, k or kk. Sometimes used with other words, as in ""okey, dokey"". When used to describe the quality of a thing, it denotes acceptability. However, its usage can also be strongly approving; as with most slang, its usage is determined by context. It could be one of the most widely used words on Earth, since it has spread from English to many other languages.\n\nThe historical record shows that ""O.K."" appeared as an abbreviation for oll korrect (a conscious misspelling of ""all correct"") in Boston newspapers in 1839, and was reinterpreted as ""Old Kinderhook"" in the 1840 United States presidential election. Because it is a recent word borne of word play, and because it is so widely used, ""O.K."" has also invited many folk etymologies. These competing theories are not supported by the historical written record, except in that folk and joke etymologies influenced the true history of the word. Since the 19th century, the word has spread around the world, the ""okay"" spelling of it first appearing in British writing in the 1860s. Spelled out in full in the 20th century, 'okay' has come to be in everyday use among English speakers, and borrowed by non-English speakers. Occasionally a humorous form okee dokee (or okey dokey) is used, as well as A-ok.\n\nAccording to languagemonitor.com, ""O.K."" is the Most Frequently Spoken Word on the Planet"

Overall I don't think it's the uniform that has the effect on students being more likely to go to a university, it just so happens that where there are uniforms, they are usually private or rich or some other unique school where parents are usually concerned about their children's education, so they do usually go to a college or university, so statistically yes, but not in reality, in my opinion.

"I agree that cell phones have no place in the classroom.  However, when the school decided to put a system in place to hold cell phones for students, they took that responsibility from the student.  If the school had an absolute policy to not allow cell phones then they would have no responsibility to replace or even care that your brother had his stolen.  Since they did implement a system to ""hold"" them for students, then they are accountable for the phone while it was in their possession."

You have to start where the ban was initiated. If it was your direct teacher, start with them. Was the ban placed on just you? If this was a school-wide ban enacted because of your actions it's going to be more difficult to get turned over. \n\nIn the case that it is a school-wide rule, you need to submit a letter to the principal requesting a meeting and stating your reasons why you feel the ban is not necessary. You cannot be overly aggressive, as this person will probably be your only chance. Going above the principal will create problems for you down the road.\n\nAfter meeting with the principal, if you feel that you still have not made any headway, your next step will be to form a petition. Start a sheet with a typed heading stating, in very clear, concise terms, what it is that you are trying to get accomplished. Get as many signatures as you can and present this to your principal. This will show how many are as interested as you in getting the ban lifted. \n\nBeyond this, attending a school board meeting might work, but if you get rejected there...your fight will be much more difficult.\n\nBest of luck to you!

"Try having an open house on a Saturday afternoon January-February.  Have it be a causal affair with all the staff there, lots of colorful brochures, and have the staff esp. chat with the little ones.

I agree with your point, but that's the problem. Those that argue AGAINST homeschooling, do not do the research to back up their standpoint, and that is ignorant. Someone on here said that they sit in a classroom and aren't distracted?! Was my school the only one in the world who's students passed notes back and forth when the teacher's backs were turned, were obsessed with who was dating who, who dumped who, what was going on that weekend... instead of paying attention in class? For the record, when you're working with your child one on one, you don't NEED six hours of school a day. 2-3 is adequate enough. How can you get distracted with only 2-3 hours of school a day? Even if you're having a sick day you can manage to work 2-3 hours, no problem. Do the research before you talk. I never participated in school sports, thought they were retarded. I didn't like team activities, because unless you're really good at it, you get harassed by the ones who do... they're the ones with the attitudes. And, imagine that... I never participated in sports, never went to dances,etc. where all the drama was, yet I was able to be successful in every job I had and be a team player. Hmmm, maybe maturity has more to do with being a team player than being on a sports team. Stupid analogy for a teacher, you think you'd come up with something better than that. If my children decide they want to compete, there are plenty of city sports, karate classes, dance classes, all that compete and often go to other areas to do it, competing nationally. Also, some schools work with homeschoolers instead of against them and allow the students to go to school just for p.e. and sports. There are more opportunities when you're homeschooled than in a public school. Yes, I went to a 'normal' school growing up, and that's what made me decide on homeschooling. If 'normal' means backstabbing each other, lying, stealing, cheating, being self-centered, slacking off responsibility, and being constantly in a popularity contest, I don't want anything to do with it, and I certainly don't want my kids being 'normal' in that respect. Because that is not a representation of real life when they graduate. You act like that on a job and you won't have a job anymore. School is nothing like the work force. We all get to pick what jobs we do, where we work, IF we work. You don't get those options in school, you're stuck. At home, as long as the kids get the work done it really doesn't matter what hours they're doing it. If they have a bad day (my child is autistic, bad days happen and it's pointless to work on them), nobody is going to give him a bad mark because they're mad that they didn't get paid for him to be there, he simply picks it up the next day. There's much more choices for homeschooled kids then public, or even private. Do the research or don't bother to answer the questions.

If you are asking on behalf of yourself, buy books on the subject from Barnes and Noble or Costco. They seem to carry the best ones. Buy more than just one book, so you can develop more and more sides of the skill. .Buy an SAT prep book from the College Board, (about $17) and read the critical reading sections. Answer the questions after. You'll get better at reading critically as you do it more.\n\nHope this helps!

"American novelist and short story writer. Salinger published one novel and several short story collections between 1948-59. His best-known work is THE CATCHER IN THE RYE (1951), a story about a rebellious teenage schoolboy and his quixotic experiences in New York. \n\nJ.D. Salinger was born and grew up in the fashionable apartment district of Manhattan, New York. He was the son of a prosperous Jewish importer of Kosher cheese and his Scotch-Irish wife. In his childhood the young Jerome was called Sonny. The family had a beautiful apartment on Park Avenue. After restless studies in prep schools, he was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy (1934-36), which he attended briefly. His friends from this period remember his sarcastic wit. In 1937 when he was eighteen and nineteen, Salinger spent five months in Europe. From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University. He fell in love with Oona O'Neill, wrote her letters almost daily, and was later shocked when she married Charles Chaplin, who was much older than she. \n\nIn 1939 Salinger took a class in short story writing at Columbia University under Whit Burnett, founder-editor of the Story Magazine. During World War II he was drafted into the infantry and was involved in the invasion of Normandy. Salinger's comrades considered him very brave, a genuine hero. During the first months in Europe Salinger managed to write stories and in Paris meet Ernest Hemingway. He was also involved in one of the bloodiest episodes of the war in Hürtgenwald, a useless battle, where he witnessed the horrors of war. \n\nIn his celebrated story 'For Esmé - With Love and Squalor' Salinger depicted a fatigued American soldier. He starts a correspondence with a thirteen-year-old British girl, which helps him to get a grip of life again. Salinger himself was hospitalized for stress according to his biographer Ian Hamilton. After serving in the Army Signal Corps and Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1942 to 1946, he devoted himself to writing. He played poker with other aspiring writers, but was considered a sour character who won all the time. He considered Hemingway and Steinbeck second rate writers but praised Melville. In 1945 Salinger married a French woman named Sylvia - she was a doctor. They were later divorced and in 1955 Salinger married Claire Douglas, the daughter of the British art critic Robert Langton Douglas. The marriage ended in divorce in 1967, when Salinger's retreat into his private world and Zen Buddhism only increased. \n\nSalinger's early short stories appeared in such magazines as Story, where his first story was published in 1940, Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, and then in the New Yorker, which published almost all of his later texts. In 1948 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish' appeared, which introduced Seymour Glass, who commits suicide. It was the earliest reference to the Glass family, whose stories would go on to form the main corpus of his writing. The 'Glass cycle' continued in the collections FRANNY AND ZOOEY (1961), RAISE HIGH THE ROOF BEAM, CARPENTERS (1963) and SEYMOUR: AN INTRODUCTION (1963). Several of the stories are narrated by Buddy Glass. 'Hapworth 16, 1924' is written in the form of a letter from summer camp, in which the seven-year-old Seymour draws a portrait of him and his younger brother Buddy. ""When I look back, listen back, over the half-dozen or slightly more original poets we've had in America, as well as the numerous talented eccentric poets and - in modern times, especially - the many gifted style deviates, I feel something close to a conviction that we have only three or four very nearly nonexpendable poets, and I think Seymour will eventually stand with those few."" (from Seymour, An Introduction) \n\nTwenty stories published in Collier's, Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, and the New Yorker between 1941 and 1948 appeared in a pirated ed"

"Personally, I would reword the statement to prevent the plural of the word ""sushi"" (which is also ""sushi"")  from sounding awkward. \n""What are some of your favorite sushi dishes?""\n\nContradictions may emerge when foreign words are used in English - as is increasingly the case in the age of globalization. When Latin words were incorporated into English, such as octopi, they retained their foreign purity. Therefore, precedent stipulates that sushi should retain its Japanese purity. In practice: one sushi, two sushi, three sushi. The main problem with this second option is that it plays havoc with the cognitive patterns that the brain uses to code language."

You should take the PSAT in 10th and 11th grade...most schools have them in those grades. It gives you an idea what it'll be like, except it doesn't have the writing section like the real test does.\n\nThe real test is very long and the writing part is about 25 minutes which is really short to gather ideas, but oh well...you can't change it so just get good at it. I have problems with math myself, it was where I scored the lowest. But you have to start practicing Algebra and definitely Geometry now if you want to do good. I wish I had paid more attention in Geometry.\n\nIf you decide the SAT is not for you, there's always the ACT, which most schools take. I'd take both...I heard the ACT is easier and more straightforward. I'd take the SAT's at least twice and maybe an ACT. Get an SAT practice book so you know what it's like. Only one test is required though. I'd take one SAT as a junior (June), and one as a senior (October).\n\nStart working hard now, that's my best advice!
You trust a trained professional giving you the test and not internet tests.  They are not given in a clinical setting, according to the methods for which the tests scores are curved.

Uh all you have to do dearheart is write maybe a four page newspaper,(not the NY times). Since most sports weren't played then, you can eliminate that section. Probably wasn't alot of entertainment, other than the hot rumours at the local tavern, so you might not need that or the travel section.\n\nBasicly I think your teacher would like you to write a front page with a headline and story from that time, maybe 'the british are coming , the british are coming' and then write it like you're a reporter after talking to paul revere.\n\nYou could write a story about Benjamin Franklin and his latest  experiments.\n\nDo an interview with some of the possible forefathers signers of the declaration of independence on what they think or what they're planning.\nThen you might have an op ed page about how you feel about the revolution , are you for it or against? Tell why , try it from the British perspective to make it interesting , then have an colonist write a letter to the editor in favour of the revolution.\n\nMaybe have some ads for the general store  and quote prices. Make up business names like Revere Ware, Silversmith,  Ben Franklin Printery for example.\n\nSince women weren't allowed to vote it'd be directed to the males of that century.\n\nFrankly I think you have a great teacher for giving you this assignment and you need to use your IMAGINATION in doing it.\n\nProbably could print enough copies on your own printer so you needn't involve kinkos.\n\nGood luck and don't make your parents do this , this is YOUR project, they've already done a project or projects in school.

That depends on how the school is set up.  Most universities use credit hours and define a full-time student as one taking 12 credit hours or more.  15 is probably average and more than that is quite challenging, but I've seen people take 18 to 21 hours and make it.\n\nMy recommendation is to take 12 to 15 each semester at least until you get the feel for college.  Summers are shorter and the classes move faster.  So 6 credit hours is full-time for the summer semester.\n\nSue

Gama, Vasco da (c. 1469-1524), Portuguese explorer and navigator, who was the first European to reach India by the sea route around Africa, so completing the quest begun 80 years before by Henry the Navigator.\n\nDa Gama was born in Sines, Alemtejo (now Baixo Alentejo). In his youth he participated in the wars against Castile. Commissioned by Emanuel, King of Portugal, to reach India by sea, da Gama sailed from Lisbon with four ships on July 8, 1497. In November he rounded the Cape of Good Hope (first rounded in 1488 by the Portuguese navigator Bartolomeu Dias) having been out of sight of land for over 13 weeks, probably the longest ocean-going voyage at that time. Natal was sighted and named at Christmas 1497. By the time he reached the port of Moçambique, he was running into Muslim opposition but at Malindi on the coast of what is now Kenya, he managed to secure a pilot to guide him eastward. Da Gama reached Kozhikode (Calicut) on the Malabar Coast of India on May 20, 1498. He found that due to the hostility of Muslim merchants, and the poor quality of the goods he had brought with him to trade, he was unable to sign a trade agreement with the ruler, known as the Zamorin. With the winds against them the voyage back to Malindi took three months and many of his crew died of scurvy before they returned to Portugal in September 1499. He had navigated some 24,000 miles and demonstrated that the Indian Ocean was not the landlocked sea Europeans had thought it to be since the time of the ancient Greeks. Da Gama was rewarded with the title of Admiral of the Indian Ocean.\n\nTo follow up the discoveries of da Gama, Pedro Álvares Cabral was immediately dispatched to India, and he established a Portuguese trading post in Calicut. When news reached Portugal that those stationed in Calicut by Cabral had been massacred, da Gama was sent in February 1502 to avenge that act. On the way to India he attacked a number of Muslim ships including the Meri, killing more than 400 men, women, and children returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. Arriving in Calicut, da Gama quickly subdued the inhabitants, impressing them with the superior fire-power of the Portuguese and forcing the Zamorin to make peace. Bearing a rich cargo of spice, he left India and sailed for Portugal establishing Portuguese colonies at Moçambique and Sofala (present-day Beira) on the coast of what is now Mozambique, and arriving in Portugal in September 1503. Richly rewarded by the Portuguese Crown for breaking the Muslim monopoly on trade with India, he settled down to profit from his ventures. For the next 20 years he saw no active sea duty. He received the title of Count of Vidigueira in 1519, and in 1524 he was named viceroy and sent to India to correct the mounting corruption among the Portuguese authorities there. Da Gama reached India in the autumn of 1524, but he died in Cochin only three months after his arrival.\n\nBy pioneering the Portuguese sea route to India, da Gama established Lisbon as the centre of the European spice trade, and laid the foundation for the Portuguese Empire which controlled trade with the ports of eastern Africa, south-west India, and Indonesia
I agree with Kimberly.\nOur 1st graders also have a math problems with charts and graphs and 4 to 5 questions all about the graph on their tests. They begin 13-4=9, so I would say that is not just simple adding/subtraction. Fact families, telling time, counting money and making predictions and estimations. Coloring?! Who has time for that anymore?!\nYes, tests! And our schools use Spaulding which teaches all the sounds so the spelling test has dictation of sounds, sentences and spelling words. 15 spelling words+ 5 sentences and 5 different phonemes.\nThey also cut and paste which is important for eye hand coordination.

The Akosombo Dam is a hydroelectric dam in southeastern Ghana. The dam created the largest man-made lake, known as Lake Volta. The dam provides electricity to Ghana and surrounding West African countries.\n\n\nThe dam is 660 meters wide and 114 meters high. It was built between 1961 and 1965. In periods of drought, the water in Lake Volta is rationed and less electricity is generated. During these times, cities in Ghana are subjected to rolling blackouts to lessen their consumption of electricity. Ghana's Volta River Authority has contracts with neighbouring countries for electricity. These contracts are given higher priority than the customers in Ghana's own cities.

Read everything that you can get your hands on: fiction, non-fiction, highbrow, lowbrow, books, journals, newspapers, magazines. Don't just read the highbrow stuff. So much of life comes from less than stellar sources, so embrace it.\n\nAs for writing, the best thing to do if you want to write and don't know what to do, or how to begin is start writing a journal, or even better, a notebook and fill it with ordinary events, larger events, interesting words, anecdotes, rants, other people's conversations, doodles and even things you read in magazines or on the back of a shampoo bottle. Everyday life can provide tremendous  material for writing.
Apply like your life depends on it.  Believe me, they will loan you the money, and especially if you go to get your doctorate or to post graduate school, then they will loan you even more

College students are more often there because they want to be rather than because they have to be. So they are more motivated and professors can teach and help students learn rather than having to drag students toward knowledge. College requires more self direction than most high schools expect -- you have to take responsibility for your own learning. And college professors are more likely to see their students as at least potential peers. Most college courses teach students how to learn rather than giving you a textbook of things you need to know -- you read from primary (original) sources, do research, etc. You can learn and have fun in both places -- in college you need to be responsible for both.\nIn some places high school students can take a college course -- in Minnesota a high school student can enroll in a college course for free and get college credit. Check to see if a similar program is available where you are.

Chapter Sixteen                  \nRahim Khan found Hassan in 1986. Hassan was married and his wife was expecting a baby. Ali had been killed by a land mine. \nHassan asked many questions about Amir and wanted to know if Amir would read a letter from him. He wept when told about Baba’s death. \nHassan and his wife decide to move with Rahim Khan, but will only live in the hut and work as servants so as not to offend Amir. \nHassan’s daughter was stillborn. \nHassan’s mother returns to see him, disfigured from a recent knife attack. They nurse her back to health. \nHassan’s wife gave birth to a son named Sohrab. \nHassan’s mother died four years later. \nHassan taught his son to be a kite runner. The Taliban banned kite fighting shortly after taking power.

Sometimes people do this, but it is generally regarded as a bad idea. People who are intending to have careers in the academic world are expected to have training from many different viewpoints, and you can't get different viewpoints if you stay at one place. Unless the place where you studied was undeniably the very best place for that subject, it would be regarded as a negative for you to stay in one place.

Your teacher is pretty much a rookie. Any veteran professor could care less what you are doing as long as you don't distract other students. If she gets distracted, it only shows her slow temper. Don't feel bad about it. You have a 3.76 to shove in her face if she doesn't like it. Either way, you will be out of school after 1 more semester (or 2 quarters).

Bee is correct that most scholarships look at GPAs and not SAT scores (especially since not all people take the SAT, some just take the ACT) if they look at grades at all. The website she mentioned is a good source, but you really have to sort through it. A lot of scholarships are based upon extracurriculars or association with specific groups. Try to see if any of the clubs you or your parents are involved with (or your parent's work) offer scholarships. Also look into opportunities for additional scholarships at the university your are applying to. Mine offered competitive scholarships (had to take a test and the top so many received an additional scholarship) for those who applied before the early-decision deadline. Plus you will probably get a merit-based/financial-based scholarship package from your school.\n\nGood Luck!

"I would recommend taking the ACT at least once to see if you can get a better score.\n\nIf you are classified as resident, then you should definitely apply as a freshman.  Don't exclude yourself prematurely by forfeiting your freshmen application and going directly to a community college.  You can always decide to attend a community college after you are accepted or rejected.  You can find out more about residency here: http://registrar.berkeley.edu/Residency/legalinfo.html\n\nThe UC should only look at your two highest SAT II scores.  I believe if you are not majoring in hard core science, your low chem test score should not have any significant impact.\n\nAny student applying to the College of Letter and Science is competing against other students applying to the College, regardless of the chosen major.  So it doesn't matter if you apply to Molecular and Cell Biology or Philosophy, the competition is the same.\n\nConcentrate on doing well in your AP courses but don't feel pressured to take the AP exam if you are not confident. Not taking the AP exam does not count against you in the application process. Scoring well on your exam (4 or 5), however, will give you a small advantage.  Take the ACT before December and submit the score, the UC will only look at the highest combine score regardless of how many times you've taken the tests.\n\nMost importantly, focus your energy on producing a well-written personal essay.  You can find a guidelines on writing your personal essays from Berkeley: http://students.berkeley.edu/files/Admissions/Personal_State_07.pdf\n\nFor your essay, please: 1) do not submit what you wrote for the ""college essay"" assignment for your senior English class; 2) do not have your fellow students or your teachers proofread it; instead, ask your parents' coworkers or friends, someone who doesn't know you very well to give you feedback and proofread. The reason is that the essay is supposed to give the admissions officers a complete picture of who you are, what you have done, and where you want to go/how you want to get there. Only someone who doesn't know you very well can evaluate whether your essay has accomplished that."
Since heads up pennies bring good luck it would have to mean good luck for the house.
There may be a number of reasons for this.\n\n1) You may be too tensed. This may cause you to forget answers,even those that you know well\n\n          Remedy - try to remain calm before the exam. Do something like playing a short game or chatting with friends so as to ease the nerves. Meditation might also help. People also say that eating a chocolate before the exams helps to ease their nerves.\n\n2) Your presentation skills may not be very good. Remember that teachers take very little time to correct the papers. So when they see a neatly presented answer, they tend to give more marks without even going through it. I have seen people write 6-7 pages for one answer and get 8/16 marks whereas another person who writes neatly but just 4 pages gets 14/16 marks\n\n             Remedy - try improving your handwriting. Even if your handwriting is not very good, give ample amount of space between words and between answers. Seperate answers with a line. Draw neat diagrams. Spend a little more effort on making a good presentation rather than trying to pour into the paper whatever you know\n\n3) You may be mugging up the answers \n\n             Remedy - Once you understand the concepts, there is no need to mug them up. Try going through the answer many times and make sure you understand it. Then close the book and try to recall. Don't directly jump into recall mode.\n\n4) You may get stuck in between when writing an answer\n\n         Remedy - When you study, mark out some important points you must remember. Try to recall by creating a flow like now this, next this and then this etc... this will help you when you get stuck.\n\nHope I was able to help you. One last tip, don't try to write exams just for the purpose of getting marks. Sure marks are important, but they are not the only important thing. You understanding and the knowledge you gain from your studies is more important. So don't worry that you get low marks. Just change your study habits and exam writing habits and things will get much better.

there isn't really an opposite to gravitational force.. however there are things to counter-act it. \nGravitational force is considered a Supernatural force.. so the only thing that would be opposite would be a different supernatural force.. \n\nthings that would kind of oppose it would be G-forces, magnets, and stuff like that.. as far as i know the only thing that would be a complete opposite of gravitational force would BE gravitational force.. for instance, if you had two planets that are totally equivilent, then one gravitational force wouldn't be any stronger than the other. if you stuck something in between the planets, it would just stay there if it had no movement to begin with, but according to newton's second law, if something is moving, even slightly, then it will continue moving until a supernatural force stops or changes it, IE: gravity.\n\nbouyancy wouldn't be an opposite because whatever is on the water surface is still being held down to the water by gravitational force.

make a POINT\n\ngive EVIDENCE for making that point\n\nEXPLAIN it
Civilization vs. Savagery\nThe central concern of Lord of the Flies is the conflict between two competing impulses that exist within all human beings: the instinct to live by rules, act peacefully, follow moral commands, and value the good of the group against the instinct to gratify one’s immediate desires, act violently to obtain supremacy over others, and enforce one’s will. This conflict might be expressed in a number of ways: civilization vs. savagery, order vs. chaos, reason vs. impulse, law vs. anarchy, or the broader heading of good vs. evil. Throughout the novel, Golding associates the instinct of civilization with good and the instinct of savagery with evil.\nThe conflict between the two instincts is the driving force of the novel, explored through the dissolution of the young English boys’ civilized, moral, disciplined behavior as they accustom themselves to a wild, brutal, barbaric life in the jungle. Lord of the Flies is an allegorical novel, which means that Golding conveys many of his main ideas and themes through symbolic characters and objects. He represents the conflict between civilization and savagery in the conflict between the novel’s two main characters: Ralph, the protagonist, who represents order and leadership; and Jack, the antagonist, who represents savagery and the desire for power.\nAs the novel progresses, Golding shows how different people feel the influences of the instincts of civilization and savagery to different degrees. Piggy, for instance, has no savage feelings, while Roger seems barely capable of comprehending the rules of civilization. Generally, however, Golding implies that the instinct of savagery is far more primal and fundamental to the human psyche than the instinct of civilization. Golding sees moral behavior, in many cases, as something that civilization forces upon the individual rather than a natural expression of human individuality. When left to their own devices, Golding implies, people naturally revert to cruelty, savagery, and barbarism. This idea of innate human evil is central to Lord of the Flies, and finds expression in several important symbols, most notably the beast and the sow’s head on the stake. Among all the characters, only Simon seems to possess anything like a natural, innate goodness. \nLoss of Innocence\nAs the boys on the island progress from well-behaved, orderly children longing for rescue to cruel, bloodthirsty hunters who have no desire to return to civilization, they naturally lose the sense of innocence that they possessed at the beginning of the novel. The painted savages in Chapter 12 who have hunted, tortured, and killed animals and human beings are a far cry from the guileless children swimming in the lagoon in Chapter 3. But Golding does not portray this loss of innocence as something that is done to the children; rather, it results naturally from their increasing openness to the innate evil and savagery that has always existed within them. Golding implies that civilization can mitigate but never wipe out the innate evil that exists within all human beings. The forest glade in which Simon sits in Chapter 3 symbolizes this loss of innocence. At first, it is a place of natural beauty and peace, but when Simon returns later in the novel, he discovers the bloody sow’s head impaled upon a stake in the middle of the clearing. The bloody offering to the beast has disrupted the paradise that existed before—a powerful symbol of innate human evil disrupting childhood innocence.\nMotifs\nMotifs are recurring structures, contrasts, or literary devices that can help to develop and inform the text’s major themes.\nBiblical Parallels\nMany critics have characterized Lord of the Flies as a retelling of episodes from the Bible. While that description may be an oversimplification, the novel does echo certain Christian images and themes. Golding does not make any explicit or direct connections to Christian symbolism in Lord of the Flies; instead,
Texas has some pretty attractive women and Utexas is a pretty awesome school, very well known and has great school spirit.\n\nBut I have to plug for my school, cause it's overlooked by most sports fans.  Baylor is D1 and it also has a nationally acclaimed Sports Sponsorship and Sales Program.  You should seriously check it out, it's very good and the only program like it (see link below).  \n\nAttractive women: We're consistently ranked in the top 10 (usually top 3) of Play Boy.  \n\nSchool spirit: If you're a sports fan, the campus is nice because the athletes there are very visible on campus and easy to talk to, you can't help but to meet them and you'll likely have classes with several from all sports, especially if you're a business major or even if you just enjoy going to the pool or a local hang out.  Without even meaning to, I'm friends with some from football, M&W bball, track, baseball, soccer and tennis, they're just normal students.  It's a lot more fun to cheer for people when you know them.

"Several European countries, such as Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia, use the term andragogy to mean adult education.\n\nThe term has come to refer to self-directed learning.\n\nAdults, being independant, having  life experience, and having the motivation, are prime candidates for the andragogical approach to teaching and learning.\n\nPedagogy is teacher-directed teaching. \n\nAndrogogy is facilitating learner-directed learning.\n\nKnowles suggested that adult educators should:\n\n    * set a cooperative learning climate\n    * create mechanisms for mutual planning\n    * arrange for a diagnosis of learner needs and interests\n    * enable the formulation of learning objectives based on the diagnosed needs and interests\n    * design sequential activities for achieving the objectives\n    * execute the design by selecting methods, materials, and resources; and\n    * evaluate the quality of the learning experience while rediagnosing needs for further learning\n\nInitially defined as, ""the art and science of helping adults learn,"" andragogy has come to be understood as an alternative to pedagogy; a learner-focused approach for people of all ages.\n\nJOB DESCRIPTION:\nAndragogists  provide instruction in a wide variety of subjects that students take for personal enrichment or self-improvement. Some teach a series of classes that provide students with useful life skills, such as cooking, personal finance, and time management classes. Others provide group instruction intended solely for recreation, such as photography, pottery, and painting courses. Many others provide one-on-one instruction in a variety of subjects, including dance, singing, or playing a musical instrument. The instruction andragogists  provide seldom leads to a particular degree and attendance is voluntary, but dedicated, talented students sometimes go on to careers in the arts. Teachers who conduct courses on academic subjects in a non-academic setting, such as literature, foreign language, and history courses, are also included in this occupation.\n\nAndragogists  provide instruction on a wide range of subjects, so they may have styles and methods of instruction that differ greatly. Most self-enrichment classes are relatively informal and not demanding of andragogists . Some classes, such as pottery or sewing, may be largely hands-on, with the andragogists demonstrating methods or techniques for the class, observing students as they attempt to do it themselves, and pointing out mistakes to students and offering suggestions to improve techniques. Other classes, such as those involving financial planning or religion and spirituality, may rely heavily on group discussions. Andragogists  may also teach classes offered through religious institutions, such as marriage preparation or classes in religion for children.\n\nMany of the classes that andragogists  teach are shorter in duration than classes taken for academic credit; some finish in 1 or 2 days to several weeks. These brief classes tend to be introductory in nature and generally focus on only one topic—for example, a cooking class that teaches students how to make bread. Some self-enrichment classes introduce children and youths to activities such as piano or drama, and may be designed to last anywhere from 1 week to several months.\n\nMany andragogists  provide one-on-one lessons to students. The instructor may only work with the student for an hour or two a week, but direct the student what they should practice in the interim until their next lesson. Many andragogists work with the same students on a weekly basis for years and derive satisfaction from observing them mature and gain expertise. The most talented students may go on to paid careers as craft artists, painters, sculptors, dancers, singers, or musicians.\n\nAll andragogists must prepare lessons beforehand and stay current in their fields. Many andragogists  are self employed and provide instruction as a business. As such, they must col"

A State is an independent territory with a government, a population and sovereignty over these. The entire landmass of the Earth (excluding Antarctica), along with coastal seas is considered to be divided among such countries. There are currently 193 States (countries) recognised by the United Nations — its 192 members and the Vatican City.\n\nIn addition to these, there are other non sovereign territories which, under the philosophy of self-determination, wish to be considered countries in this sense. Some of these have de facto control over their population and territory, such as Abkazia, but are not considered States as they are not recognised as having sovereignty. On the other hand, in some internationally-recognised States, there is no functioning central government or there are several de facto States and governments. These are internationally not considered to constitute separate States, but rather to exist on the territory of the internationally recognised State.\n\nLook in the following link for names
a school day shouldnt be extended because kids need play time and relax time which they would not have if they go to school 2more hours...between home-work,chores,15 minutes of reading and a bed time that is probably fairly early when would a child have personal time?...got to fit dinner in there too...unless they go later to school...by the way also if the parents work and the kids get out late the parents may be less likely to be helpful with home-work and such because they will be tired too

I found this site that lists schools with programs.  I don't think that these are deaf-only day schools, but each one has a different program.  If you want him to go on an oral path (which I'm guessing you aren't pushing since he was at a residential school), then you could send him to Sudie Williams.  If you want total communication, but inclusion, go with Herbert Marcus.  Stonewall Jackson Elementary has a total communication, self-contained system (which is probably the closest to what you are looking for).\n\nI don't have any information other than this, but I hope this helps.

"Most schools will accept essays and other homework typed on a computer using a size 12 font with a top and bottom margin of 1 inch and right and left margins of 1/2 of an inch each side.  Two pages single spaced using these demensions would average about 1,122 words for the total 2 page document.  So one page single spaced would obviously be approximately 561 words.  Double spaced one page would equal about 561 words.  Of course it all depends on the words you choose to write.  If you follow that guide you should be able to type up your hand written essay and then be able to estimate whether you've written too much or not enough.  If you use Microsoft Word it will tell you exactly how many words you have typed by clicking on ""Tools"" in your tool bar.  You might want to use that format in case your teacher actually sits down and counts the words in your essay.  I have seen it where the teacher has lowered marks if you use a larger font than 12.  They know that you are just trying to fill in space with any size larger then 12.\nGood Luck\np.s. everything that I typed above Good Luck equals 198 words."
Many colleges actually offer 6 year program especially designed for P.A.'s. Such schools include Quinnipiac University in Connecticut and U Wisconsin-Madison.

"Today, (11/14/2006), my teacher gave the whole class a ""confidence lecture"" because we weren't performing so well.\n\nHe told us that you will get nowhere in life unless you be assertive and aggressive (NOT violent), and I believe that is true.\n - You have to move people out of the way, and not let them move you.\n - Don't stand in the corner, be the center of the party.\n\nHe also told us that high school only comes once, and after four years of the 'intense drama', you probably might not even see those people again.\n - Make the best of your four years (or more).\n - Don't make a big deal about labels: be yourself.\n\nI'm only a freshman now, but his sermon got me thinking...\nAfter high school:\n - Where will I go?\n - Who will I be with?\n - Why my life turned out that way\n - etc.\n\n""I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing something we must learn; And we are led to those who help us most to grow if we let them, and we help them in return.

My sons had a weird schedule like this too and I'd suggest that if it doesn't bother your son, then leave it be.  I don't think the school needs a bunch of parents trying to figure their system out and take up their time, that they may not have.  Leave it be.  If there are any quirks, the school will figure it out and fix the problem.  Wait it out while they figure it out themselves.  I'm sure they understand there needs to be time for the child to walk to their other classroom in between time schedules.  I believe they're trying to fit classes into a system where they'll have math one morning, and then math in the afternoon another day because some kids learn better in the morning and other kids learn better in the afternoon.  They're the pros, let them figure it out.  You're not the one who has to follow the schedule and I bet the kids, your kid too, can and will follow it without a problem.  Just hang in there and have some faith in the teachers.  Good luck!
Definitely go for the accredited school.  It makes a big difference.

Take the MCAT's, do well on them (which you probably should.)  Apply to med school of your choice...go into serious debt.  Med school is 3 years, then you intern and have your residency (which I believe is another 3 years).  You then can practice in general medicine, if you specialize, that's another residency.  But yes, someone with a bachelor's in nursing can be a doctor, most med schools don't require a pre-med degree to apply and be accepted.  The requirements for acceptance would depend on the med schools you're applying to.  Best of luck to you.

"I was standing in the office one day when a teacher brought in a paper that she was concerned about. We have an in-house officer so she showed it to him. He told her to photocopy it and he took the original.\nMy advice; if you are in doubt then at the very least photocopy it. Better yet, copy it and if you do not have an officer at school, pass it on to the principal. Because you do not really know for sure then you can let someone else decide. If it is nothing... wonderful! If it is something and you did nothing... not so good.\nLastly, you could flat out ask the kids. Sometimes they aren't so bright about talking. They may flat out tell you that they were just doodling... or that this is their ""symbol."" At least you can put your mind to rest."

Steam Engine, mechanical device used to transfer the energy of steam into mechanical energy for a variety of applications, including propulsion and generating electricity. The basic principle of the steam engine involves transforming the heat energy of steam into mechanical energy by permitting the steam to expand and cool in a cylinder equipped with a movable piston. Steam that is to be used for power or heating purposes is usually generated in a boiler. The simplest form of boiler is a closed vessel containing water, which is heated by a flame so that the water turns to saturated steam. The ordinary household-heating system usually has a boiler of this type, but steam-generating plants used for power purposes are more complex in design and are equipped with various auxiliary devices. The efficiency of a steam engine is generally low, and therefore, in most power generation applications, the steam engines have been replaced by steam turbines \n\nSteam engines also improved significantly. In early steam engines, steam from the boiler was directed to a cylinder, where it drove the movement of a single piston before it was expelled. These single-expansion engines wasted some of the steam’s energy. More efficient double-expansion engines used the steam expelled from one cylinder to power another cylinder. By 1873 even more efficient triple-expansion engines came into use.

"Unfortunately, the child's rights will always overrule yours since he is a special education student.  You are not covered by the same ""Zero Tolerance"" rules that regular ed. teachers are protected under.  \n\nI have had the same problem.  I have had a broken collarbone, bruised spleen, broken jaw, too many bites, contusions, bruises and gashes to count, and it always is the same line:  You are a special ed. teacher:  it comes with the territory.  It shouldn't be that way, but it's always come down to the same thing.\n\nNow -- there is one flaw that is apparent in your administrators' thinking:  they are allowed to suspend him up to 10 days per school year before it has to go to a manifestation hearing.  And a manifestation meeting only determines if his behavior is a direct result of his disability.  Most autistic kids don't automatically abuse their teachers!  I've had many that didn't!\n\nI have also had strong administrators that went to bat for the school and put this kind of kid (after worlds of documentation, mind you!) on homebound because HE WAS A DANGER TO HIMSELF AND OTHERS.  That has to be the key -- is he going to hurt another child?  It can't be YOU or another adult, but another student that is potentially at risk.\n\nIf that doesn't work, I have used parents to complain.  You have to be really careful in doing this, but a carefully worded verbal statement here and there can get the right parent in the office to advocate for the removal of that abusive student away from her child.  \n\nYour student probably does know what he is doing.  And I've been in your shoes for years -- wondering what part of my body is going to be injured next.  The front desk at the hospital know me by my first name when I walk in!  As trite as it sounds, just keep remembering that you are doing something that few people want to do, and that you are doing something wonderful.  \n\nGood luck, and get out your Special Ed.

""mister smith, i hurt my knee the other day ding something and i'm kinda scared to tell my parents about it because i don't want to get in trouble. do you think i should see a doctor about this?"" he'll probably say, ""well, let's take a look at it....""  and he will let you know what he thinks. he may lecture you for not wanting to tell mom or dad, but, that's because he's a teacher and he cares.\n\ngood luck!"
The French and Indians were not against each other they were allies of each other. The French and the Indians fought the colonists from Britain. They fought for more land. This affected american colonies because King George III had to pay off all the damages of the war and all the British soldiers for helping. King George made the Quartering act, Navigation act, Stamp act, Sugar act, and the tea act. These acts taxed all colonists on things they needed like molasses, licenses, and tea. King George did not allow colonists to trade with anyone except from the British. Colonists had to provide homes for soldiers.  King George controlled colonists 3000 miles away!!!!

Anne Frank (1929 - 1945)  She and her family lived in an attic for several years, hiding from the Nazis.  They were discovered and sent to concentration camps where Anne died.  Later, the diary that she kept during the time she and her family were hiding was found and published.  This quote is from her diary.  And she was truly remarkable.

But starting this year, students from outside the European Union are required to pay tuition. For citizens from the European Union the education is still free. \nYou might try searching the net (Google obvious choice) to find universities in the countries you mention, and find an answer to your question by contacting them directly. Or perhaps contacting your embassy in each country to ask them.

Coyotes   \n\nCoyotes are a member of the dog family. Their scientific name is ``Canis latrans``, it means ``barking dog.`` This name was given by Thomas Say in 1835. He was one of the first white men to hear the late twilight and early morning howling of this wolf like creature.  \n\nAppearance   \n\nCoyotes can be anywhere from a yellowish brown to a tawny grey in colour. Their belly is usually off~white. This colour will usually extend onto the throat area. Coyotes have a pointed muzzle and a flat forehead. The tail is quite bushy. Coyotes are between the size of a fox and a wolf.  \n\nBehavior   \n\nCoyotes are quite playful. Pups will often play~fight and wrestle. A scared coyote will hold its head low and tuck his tail between his/her legs.  \n\nWhen a coyote hears loud sounds it will prick its ears up. If it is another coyote, it will often reply. To us this is howling, but to a coyote it is their way of communicating. They are most active during the early morning and at twilight.  \n\nDiet   \n\nCoyotes, as you would think, are mainly carnivores. But, they will also eat fruit and insects. The carnivore part of their diet is mostly rodents, such as mice, rats and the odd rabbit. They also eat carrion. Carrion is animal carcasses that other carnivores have eaten off all they want and left it to rot.  \n\nBreeding   \n\nCoyotes start breeding at about one year. When they find a mate, it is for life. Mating takes place in about February. The pups are born 60 to 63 days later. There are usually five to seven pups, to a maximum of nineteen.  \n\nRange   \n\nCoyotes are found in most of North America, except the cold Arctic tundra. Coyotes can adapt to most climates quite well.  \n\nCoyotes are very interesting animals. Their appearance and behavior is quite similar to that of a dogs. Whenever you see a coyote, think of the storey behind that fur coat. Coyotes have survived for thousands of years, and if we take care of them, they`ll be here for thousands more. Coyotes, like all animals are part of the eco~system, and without one animal it can come crashing down. The more animals that fall, the closer we are to falling.

You hit the big ones that I would have suggested.  Be careful and not to overextend yourself.  Your grades are important and being a tutor is a great way to help others and keep your academic edge.  Also, working with the professors on projects.  It is better to be good at a couple of things than to be so spread out you are not good at anything.  Have one activity where you are in charge.  You will gain a lot from that experience.

Talk to your college--if your grades are that high and your ACT/SAT scores are high, you'll get academic scholarships. What are you involved in at high school? You'll be able to get scholarships doing those things too.\n\nAbout the scholarships themselves--get a book of scholarships and spend the winter filling out as many as you can. If you don't think they apply to you, just do it. You never know.\n\nAlso, what is your major? If you're a female and going into math, then you'll get a scholarship. If you're going to go into English, you're out of luck.\n\nTry this scholarship book: http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9780743265485&itm=3\n\nNot everyone publishes their scholarships on the web, so it's easier to find and enter ones. They have scholarships for EVERYONE and anyone.

1. Develop your voice – A high whiney voice is not perceived to be one of authority.  In fact, a high soft voice can make you sound like prey to an aggressive co-worker who is out to make his/her career at the expense of anyone else.   Begin doing exercises to lower the pitch of your voice.  Here is one to start:  Sing — but do it an octave lower on all your favorite songs.  Practice this and, after a period of time, your voice will begin to lower. \n\n2. Slow down – People will perceive you as nervous and unsure of yourself if you talk fast.  However, be careful not to slow down to the point where people begin to finish your sentences just to help you finish. \n\n3. Animate your voice – Avoid a monotone.  Use dynamics.  Your pitch should raise and lower.  Your volume should be soft and loud.  Listen to your local TV news anchor; take notes. \n\n4. Enunciate your words – Speak clearly.  Don’t mumble.  If people are always saying, “huh,” to you, you are mumbling. \n\n5. Use appropriate volume – Use a volume that is appropriate for the setting.  Speak more softly when you are alone and close.  Speak louder when you are speaking to larger groups or across larger spaces. \n\n6. Pronounce your words correctly – People will judge your competency through your vocabulary.  If you aren’t sure how to say a word, don’t use it. \n\n7. Use the right words – If you’re not sure of the meaning of a word, don’t use it.  Start a program of learning a new word a day.  Use it sometime in your conversations during the day. \n\n8. Make eye contact – I know a person who is very competent in her job.  However, when she speaks to individuals or groups, she does so with her eyes shut.  When she opens them periodically, she stares off in a direction away from the listener.  She is perceived as incompetent by those with whom she consults.  One technique to help with this is to consciously look into one of the listener’s eyes and then move to the other.  Going back and forth between the two (and I hope they only have two) makes your eyes appear to sparkle.  Another trick is to imagine a letter “T” on the listener’s face with the cross bar being an imaginary line across the eye brows and the vertical line coming down the center of the nose.  Keep your eyes scanning that “T” zone. \n\n9. Use gestures – Make your whole body talk.  Use smaller gestures for individuals and small groups.  The gestures should get larger as the group that one is addressing increases in size. \n\n10. Don’t send mixed messages – Make your words, gestures, facial expressions, tone, and message match.  Disciplining an employee while smiling sends a mixed message and, therefore, is ineffective.  If you have to deliver a negative message, make your words, facial expressions, and tone match the message.

"As far as I ever learned, they are two words meaning the same thing, synonyms.  \n\nMorality refers to the concept of human ethics which pertains to matters of good and evil —also referred to as ""right or wrong"", used within three contexts: individual conscience; systems of principles and judgments — sometimes called moral values —shared within a cultural, religious, secular, Humanist, or philosophical community; and codes of behavior or conduct.\n\nThe field of ethics, also called moral philosophy, involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. Philosophers today usually divide ethical theories into three general subject areas: meta ethics, normative ethics, and applied ethics."
"""M&M's"" candies were first marketed by Forrest Mars Sr. and R. Bruce Murrie.  They used the first initial of both of their last names, and the apostrophe ""s"" denotes their ownership of the idea and the trademark rather than the fact that there are more than one in a bag."
Typically an associate's degree is higher, but in some fields the certification is what is required. I recommend you examine some companies hiring for what you want to do and learn which piece of paper earns you a higher paycheck. Often a career center counselor at your college is the best, first source of information here.
"In general, ""authentic"" food is made fresh from fresh ingredients. Fast food is pre-made, (mass produced) frozen and shipped to stores where it is microwaved. That leads to another big difference, which is fast food has preservatives (sometimes lots of them), which freshly prepared food does not. Next, authentic food is prepared using the spices and even cooking techniques that are uniqe to the culture and tastes. fast food is not, and often relies on salt and fats for achieving better taste. Unrelated to the actual taste of the food, dining in a restaurant versus out of a bag is a much better dining experience. These are all big differences in my opinion that make authntic food the better choice."

Cerebral palsy is a pretty big disability to simplify. It ranges from very minimal movement problems to spastic movements which can create problems to move around. For example, if the student in a wheelchair, the room has to be set up that the child can maneuver around the room without bumping into a desk or chair. The desk has to be a certain height if the child is in a wheelchair. Depending on the severity and age, the student could be in and out of the classroom for various therapies such as speech, occupational, and physical therapy. I have included some readings that can help you learn more about the subject.

"Do you feel that getting you IN will be impossible or that the work will be impossible?  Or, do you just not want to go to college?  \n\nIf you are thinking that getting IN is impossible, but don't want to dampen your dad's enthusiasm, then encourage your dad to keep trying.  Perhaps he can get you there, with connections and a checkbook, despite you being ""a pretty good student.""   If he can, then, YAY! for him AND for you!  That will,guarantee you a fabulous life, if you want it.  At that point, you will go and take your basics.  They will be ,relatively,  the same basics that other major U's offer, and you will be capable of handling the beginning work, while getting used to college life.  \n\nJust put in your aps, get references, and do the best you can do to get there.  If they say no, then, they say no, and you tried.  But, just in case, have back up U's, like Penn State or something (they take everyone).  (joking). If money is an issue (because you have to pay for each ap, just explain to your father you are giving yourself a safety net--that you would rather not waste time if the others won't let you in.   Hopefully, since he is so adamant about a good education, he will understand that any place is a better place than no place.  \n\nIf you are afraid that you are not ready for college or that you are not college material, (and you might be 100% correct), suck it up, and give your dad's way a try for a semester.  The worst that could happen is you fail.  Big deal!  I have had students fail that have gone on to manage stores and make more money than I do teaching!  College is not for everyone.  Still, you need to find out.  You may say it is not for you, but you haven't tried it yet.  You may just find out that while you were just a ""pretty good"" student in high school, you RULE in the world of higher education, \n\nYou cannot get anything in this world unless you ask for it and take it.   You cannot have an exciting life, unless you try a little bit of everything.  You won't know if you can or you can't until you do.   Good Luck to you!"

"Only you know best what's good for you and her because you were her student. But if I were you, I would DEFINITELY go for it. I'm the kind of student (now a high school freshman) who has been blessed enough to have several teachers who have made a positive and significant difference in my life. And I told them about it, and it's just a great experience and relationship. You just can't have that kind of relationship with anyone other than a teacher, because, like any other relationship, all are difference. I would definitely do it. Don't feel embarassed. Write what you feel. Don't try to make it sound professional -- this is an old, favorite teacher of yours. If she really is a favorite, you should feel comfortable enough to feel like yourself around her. Trust me, I would do it -- teachers love getting that kind of thing, you'll feel better that you did it, and maybe you could make a difference in each other's lives. And if you're unsure of how to do it, it's like what my all-time favorite social studies teacher has been telling me lately, ""Just do it."""

Well, there isn't really such a thing as a college portfolio unless you plan on majoring in something like the arts.  In that situation you would need to include drawings, photos, music recordings or any other samples of your work that would show your abilities. If you are planning on going straight into some coursework like philosophy, psychology, biology or something then it really isn't necessary.  Instead you would need to show that you are a well rounded person and include as part of your application that you volunteered or worked in different areas or that you won academic prizes/scholarships or some type of talent that you have in which you either participated in or won recognition in.  Typically colleges won't want to see report cards prior to high school because it doesn't really show much, but definitely include award type material that you won at any age.  But in general when you apply, you need to put in a college application, the application fee, letters of recommendations and an essay.  If you have a particular school in mind, you can take a look at their application right now to see what they want.  You can also see the types of questions they want you to answer as part of their essay portion (some schools won't require essays) and if the essay asks about volunteer type stuff or why your a good applicant, you might want to start doing some extracurricular activities either as part of the school or outside of school.  Just remember, it's not only about grades, it's about the other stuff that you do as well.

LINES WRITTEN IN EARLY SPRING \n          I HEARD a thousand blended notes,\n          While in a grove I sate reclined,\n          In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts\n          Bring sad thoughts to the mind.\n\n          To her fair works did Nature link\n          The human soul that through me ran;\n          And much it grieved my heart to think\n          What man has made of man.\n\n          Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,\n          The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;                         10\n          And 'tis my faith that every flower\n          Enjoys the air it breathes.\n\n          The birds around me hopped and played,\n          Their thoughts I cannot measure:--\n          But the least motion which they made\n          It seemed a thrill of pleasure.\n\n          The budding twigs spread out their fan,\n          To catch the breezy air;\n          And I must think, do all I can,\n          That there was pleasure there.                              20\n\n          If this belief from heaven be sent,\n          If such be Nature's holy plan,\n          Have I not reason to lament\n          What man has made of man?\n                                     \n\n\nhope tht helps
1. If you never tried to swim, for example, can you do it? You don't know, right? You'll have to try swimming and then you will know if you can do it or not.\n2.The man who insist he is as good as any body talks nonsense because he would have to be as good as the best and it is o.k. but also he would have to be as bad as the worst--is it possible to be the best and the worst of all people at the same time? No, thus he is a fool.\n3.The fear of making a mistake robs you from the opportunities to learn, because our mistakes are our best teachers. For example, if a new emigrant is afraid to speak a word in English  because he or she might make a mistake, they will never learn to speak the language. Isn't it better to make mistakes and learn the language than to remain in this country without the communicating skills? So the greatest mistake of this emigrant can came from a fear of making a mistake.  Sorry I made the explanation so long. . .

Try the gov't labs in your field, or major universities, or the organizations.  For example, if you field is astronomy, the American Astronomical Society has a job register and an internship listing on it's website, and NOAO, NSO, NRAO, and the CfA have job listings on their sites as well.

"Psuedoword decoding is the ability to pronounce non words.  For example, you daughter might have been given the pseudoword, ""bimsop"" and asked to pronounce it.  It would show whether or not she could sound things out.  People can learn words by sight - that is, they recognize the configuration of letters and learn that the letters b a n a n a spell banana, but they can also learn words by sounding them out - buh nah nuh.  It's a basis for the phonics approach to reading - being able to decode words by sounding them out.  By using phony words, a teacher can judge a child's word attack skills, using phonics, by eliminating the possibility that the child knows the word by sight."

Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that occurs in waves. As such, different types have different wavelengths and frequencies. The highest energy (smallest wavelength and greatest frequency) is Gamma rays. Next is infrared rays. Decreasing in energy, next is ultraviolet rays. Then comes the range of light that we can see, called accordingly, visible light. With lower energy than that is microwaves and radio waves which have the longest wavelengths and shortest frequencies.

I think that the best way to promote cultural awareness in the school community is to provide students and faculty with cultural events that are happening in your local community, providing local and inexpensive trips to the museums that are not cultural limited, getting students involved by doing research on different cultures that they are unaware of, surveying the community with things for example:( Do you listen to hip hop? Well if you do did you know that hip hop originated.....) you know something in that manner. Well there are alot of things that I would do to ensure that people know about other people culture besides there own.

Well.. I went to the Internet and can find NOTHING on this subject and personally.. I know many sayings but have never heard of this particular one.
"Dyslexic?  Probably not.  The clue is that you know the words and can read and understand when you read silently.  Is your everyday speech also a bit "" weird""?  If so, get a consultation with a speech therapist.  If you speak fluently, but read a little disjointed, consult an experienced reading teacher.\nMany people get nervous when reading aloud.  It could just be a knee jerk reaction from a bad school read aloud experience.  You may benefit from some breathing/punctuation instruction and practice. The Read Naturally program has great, and relatively inexpensive, materials at various grade levels to elp with reading fluency.  The program comes with CDs so the reader can listen to models and then practice reading along with the person on the CD. \n You could also use a Talk Back ( or Tok Bak etc. )   which is simple device which you can make easily for yourself with some PVC pipe which looks similar to old fashioned phone receiver ( pre cell phone).   You hold this up to your mouth and ear and read into it.  You can instantly hear what you sound like to others.   Finally, you can read into a tape recorder and listen to yourself to see if you can spot where the porblem area is.  I have some clients who read and understand well, but stumble over long words.  Another has a poorly repaired cleft palate which makes it difficult for her to breathe through her nose. What is more important ?  To be able to read and understand  or to sound great when you read aloud?  Unless you have a job that requires this,just accept that this is the way you are and move on.   If you have a personal reason for wanting to read more fluently, like perhaps you want to read to children, then try one of the strategies we have already mentioned.   Good luck"

"I wasn't able to find a specific site with much more than few sentences about him\n\nCharles Thilorier was a scientist who gave the earliest description of solid carbon dioxide. In 1834 he opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a ""snow"" of solid CO2.\n\nDry Ice is the trademark for carbon dioxide in its solid form, frozen at -109.3° F or -79.5° C. It is primarily used as a refrigerant. Dry Ice does not melt but goes directly from a solid to a gas in a process called sublimation. It is generally accepted that French chemist, Charles Thilorier, was the first to record the appearance of it in 1835. The Dry Ice Corporation of America first trademarked the name Dry Ice in 1925"

You must obtain a bachelor's degree before you can apply to Medical school. Most students major in Biology and minor in humanities (Philosophy is a popular minor among pre-med students), do lots of community work, work with their pre-med counselor and professors to prepare for the MCAT exam and must take a minimum of 2 Biology courses (with lab), 4 Chemistry courses (General and Organic) and 2 Physics courses along with some necessary Math. Getting admitted into medical school  is a very competitive process and the tuition cost can be a challenge (over 200,000 USD for 4 years). Check the AMA (American Medical Association) website for more information.
"There are many graduates.   But law school is different.   Many just go to get the degree.  The degree seems to hypnotize a great deal of the public -- both the students and those who hire them.  So law graduates may work in a wide variety of fields, many of which have nothing to do with the law.  But they all let the right people know they have a legal education, and much more important, a law degree.  And a world that can't distinguish image from reality says ""You're just the sort of man we want.""\nSo, yes there are ""too many"" lawyers if they all were actually lawyers.  But the truth is they are in all kinds of different jobs.   I wouldn't be surprised if MOST law school graduates aren't practicing lawyers."

I think looking at the strengths of your location might be the best option.  If you live in a city, try outings to parks or museums or other unorthodox habitats.\n\nArt is also an interesting way to promote self exploration and expression.  Have them use any style, abstraction, colours or media.  Maybe even look at how to bring street art into their work to make a link with urban movements.\n\nAnother approach may be photography; as right now everyone has a camera in one form or another.  The camera phone movie challenge is always interesting and again, it promotes a lot of self exploration.\n\nThere are a lot of other activities that can be encouraged, but I dare not bore you.  I hope these suggestion could at least be a catalyst for more ideas.

"I'm from London and certainly remember this in my schooldays (60s/70s) though I used to shout ""Fains!"" or ""Fains I!""\n\nSee the following:\n\n"" : 'Feign Knights' is a phrase used by children in Kent, England, UK. I grew up using this phrase as did all my childhood friends. It was used whilst playing tag games and you crossed your fingers saying 'feign knights' and it meant no one could tag you, you were safe, immune from being caught in the game. I now live in Gloucestershire and they do not use this phrase here and have not even heard of it.\n\n: I can certainly confirm that it is used in Kent - I live there (though I am not a native) but I always thought it was spelled 'fainites': I have to confess I am not at all sure about that, as it is not often one sees it written down.\n\n: It was certainly not used where I grew up - my childhood being divided between the Republic of Ireland and schools in Kent and Berkshire.\n\n: Another peculiarly Kentish usage seems to be 'Monkey Peas' for woodlice.\n\n: DFG\n\nThere is an interesting thread on ""faynights"" at rootsweb.com (link below). People from the London area mostly, and some Aussies, recall variations like Faynights, Fanites, Fanelights, Vainites, Venites, etc. The most cogent explanation offered by a poster draws on the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (of which I do not have a copy)which says that the expression is from ""Fains I"" or ""Fains it"". ""Fain"" is taken to be a childhood slang term meaning to claim an exemption from some penalty. \n\nThe SOD apparently says that the etymology of ""fane"" is unknown, so I feel free to speculate that it may be from the archaic English word ""fane"" meaning a temple, shrine or sanctuary."""

"if you don't know, ""par"" is a golfing term. It is the approximate ""rating"" of difficulty for each hole. Only better golfers actually ""make par"" regularly. When a golfer shoots below par, that is EXCELLENT! Only the very best players can do that regularly.

Check out autistic subculture.\n\nThe fascinating part of this, and what should make it more accessible to you, is that most of autistic subculture exists on the Internet. With face-to-face communication difficult, we find it much more easy to communicate in writing via message boards.\n\nThe majority of these autistics are high-functioning; but there is quite a showing of nonverbal autistics who communicate only by writing.\n\nHere's one site, from which you should be able to follow links to quite a few others:\nhttp://www.aspiesforfreedom.com/\n\nOne warning: Don't pity these people or look down on them. The older ones just ignore it and make you feel awkward. The younger ones might even flame you; they've had to take enough of it in school already.

The formula for determining compound interest is:\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n\nTo determine how long it takes your money to double, use the following:\nAt = 2 = amount at time t\nAo = 1 = amount at beginning\nr = .07 (7%) = rate of interest\nn = 2 = number of times compounded yearly\n\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n2 = 1 * (1 + .07/2)^(2t)\n2 = 1.035^2t\nlog 2 = 2t log 1.035\nlog 2 / log 1.035 = 2t\nt = (0.30103 / 0.01494) / 2 = 10.07 years (solution)\n\nCheck:\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\n2 = 1 * (1 + .07/2)^(2*10.07)\n2 = 1.035^20.14\n2 = 1.9994 (close enough!)\n\nNow, for the above formula, to find t, given the other values:\nAt = Ao (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\nAt / Ao = (1 + r/n)^(n*t)\nlog (At / Ao) = (n*t) log (1 + r/n)\nn * t = log (At/Ao) / log (1 + r/n)\nt = log (At/Ao) / n log (1 + r/n)

For the first one, ln x = 63, just rewrite the equation in exponential form:\n\nx = e^63\n\nFor the next one, remember that ln e^5x = 5x, and you're pretty much there.\n\nFor the third one, note that it is quadratic in e^x, so you can use any of the techniques for solving quadratics.  As a clue, suppose we say y = e^x,  Then your problem becomes\n\ny^2 - 6y + 8 = 0\n\nSolve that for y, then remember that y = e^x.  You'll need to take the natural log of both sides to get your final answer.\n\nHope that helps.

I couldn't understand the previous answer, so I thought I'd offer my advice:\n\nA Kaplan course can definitely prepare you for the GMAT. While taking a math course may help revive your math skills, there is no point in studying subjects that aren't relevant to the test. What we offer is targeted methods and targeted practice so you work smarter and earn more points. The course will also offer you structured studies so that you never stare at a bunch of books not knowing where to start. Finally, our course offers what we call the Ultimate Practice test: the last test of your course is at an actual prometric center, offering you a 'dress rehearsal' for the big day.\nAnd if, for some reason, your scores don't go up, we'll give you your money back.\n\nAs a Kaplan teacher, I may be biased, but I'm convinced that there is no better way to prepare for a standardized exam, and especially not one as complicated as the GMAT.\n\nbest of luck!\nLighty
Where was he from?\n\nEratosthenes was born in Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), but worked and died in Alexandria capital of Ptolemaic Egypt. He never married. He was reputedly known for his haughty character. Eratosthenes studied at Alexandria and for some years in Athens. In 236 BC he was appointed by Ptolemy III Euergetes I as librarian of the Alexandrian library, succeeding the first librarian, Zenodotos, in that post. He made several important contributions to mathematics and science, and was a good friend to Archimedes. Around 255 BC he invented the armillary sphere, which was widely used until the invention of the orrery in the 18th century. In 195 BC he became blind and a year later he supposedly starved himself to death.\n\nHe is credited by Cleomedes in On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies with having calculated the Earth's circumference around 240 BC, using trigonometry and knowledge of the angle of elevation of the Sun at noon in Alexandria and Syene (now Aswan, Egypt).\n\nMeasurement of the Earth\n\nEratosthenes knew that on the summer solstice at local noon in the town of Syene on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead. He also knew, from measurement, that in his hometown of Alexandria, the angle of elevation of the Sun would be 7.2° south of the zenith at the same time. Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 7.2/360 of the total circumference of the Earth. The distance between the cities was known from caravan travellings to be about 5000 stadia: approximately 800 km. He established a final value of 700 stadia per degree, which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia. The exact size of the stadion he used is no longer known (the common Attic stadion was about 185 m), but it is generally believed that the circumference calculated by Eratosthenes corresponds to 39,690 km [citation needed]. Although Eratosthenes' method was well founded, the accuracy of his calculation was inherently limited. The accuracy of Eratosthenes' measurement would have been reduced by the fact that Syene is not precisely on the Tropic of Cancer, is not directly south of Alexandria, and the Sun appears as a disk located at a finite distance from the Earth instead of as a point source of light at an infinite distance. There are other sources of experimental error: the greatest limitation to Eratosthenes' method was that, in antiquity, angles could only be measured to within about a quarter of a degree, and overland distance measurements were even less reliable. So the accuracy of the result of Eratosthenes' calculation is surprising: the circumference of the Earth around the poles is now measured at 40,008 km.\n\nEratosthenes' experiment was highly regarded at the time, and his estimate of the Earth’s size was accepted for hundreds of years afterwards. His method was used by Posidonius about 150 years later.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes\n\nWhen did he live?  Eratosthenes (Greek)  (276 BC - 194 BC)\n\nWhat great contribution did he make regarding the earth?  He is noted for devising a system of latitude and longitude, and for being the first known to have calculated the circumference of the Earth.\n\nEratosthenes' experiment was highly regarded at the time, and his estimate of the Earth’s size was accepted for hundreds of years afterwards. His method was used by Posidonius about 150 years later.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes\n\nHow did he do it?\n\nEratosthenes knew that on the summer solstice at local noon in the town of Syene on the Tropic of Cancer, the sun would appear at the zenith, directly overhead.

No, it isn't. Unsupported opinion is not so valuable. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_etymology:\nThe word news has been claimed to be an acronym of the four cardinal directions: (North, East, West, and South). However, old spellings of the word varied widely (e.g. newesse, newis, nevis, neus, newys, niewes, newis, nues, etc.). It is simply a plural form of new.\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/news.htm:\nClaim:   The word news is an acronym formed from the words north, east, west, and south. \n\nStatus:   False. \n\nOrigins:   Some explanations are just too simple to accept. The notion that news -- information about recent events -- is the plural of the word new just doesn't sound right, so somebody cooked up the notion that the word is an acronym formed from the initial letters of the four cardinal compass points (north, east, west, and south), supposedly because news is information from all over the land. \n\nIt's not surprising this explanation sounds a bit odd to us, because new is an adjective and not a noun, so how can it have a plural form? Although adjectives don't generally have plurals in English, they do in other languages. In some Romance languages, for example, adjectives change to agree in number with the nouns they modify. So, in Spanish a white house is a casa blanca, but white houses are casas blancas. Likewise, in French a tall woman is a grande femme, but tall womEn are grandes femmes. When nouveau, the French word for new, modifies a plural (feminine) noun, it becomes nouvelles, which is also the French word for news. \n\nNot so strange after all.

"In a chemical reaction, the quantity of each element does not change. Thus, each side of the equation must represent the same quantity of any particular element. Also in case of net ionic reactions the same charge must be present on both sides of the equation. Then, and only then, the equation is balanced. Given an unbalanced equation, one may balance it by changing the scalar number for each molecular formula.\n\nSimple chemical equations can be balanced by inspection, that is, by trial and error. Generally, it is best to balance the most complicated molecule first. Hydrogen and oxygen are usually balanced last.\n\nEx #1. Na + O2 → Na2O\n\nIn order for this equation to be balanced, there must be an equal amount of Na on the left hand side as on the right hand side. As it stands now, there is 1 Na on the left but 2 Na's on the right. This problem is solved by putting a 2 in front of the Na on the left hand side:\n\n    2Na + O2 → Na2O\n\nIn this equation there are 2 Na atoms on the left and 2 Na atoms on the right. In the next step the oxygen atoms are balanced as well. On the left hand side there are 2 O atoms and the right hand side only has one. This is still an unbalanced equation. To fix this a 2 is added in front of the Na2O on the right hand side. Now the equation reads:\n\n    2Na + O2 → 2Na2O\n\nNotice that the 2 on the right hand side is ""distributed"" to both the Na2 and the O. Currently the left hand side of the equation has 2 Na atoms and 2 O atoms. The right hand side has 4 Na's total and 2 O's. Again, this is a problem, there must be an equal amount of each chemical on both sides. To fix this 2 more Na's are added on the left side. The equation will now look like this:\n\n    4Na + O2 → 2Na2O\n\nThis equation is a balanced equation because there is an equal number of atoms of each element on the left and right hand sides of the equation.\n\nEx #2. P4 + O2 → P4O10\n\nThis equation is not balanced because there is an unequal amount of O's on both sides of the equation. The left hand side has 4 P's and the right hand side has 4 P's. So the P atoms are balanced. The left hand side has 2 O's and the right hand side has 10 O's. To fix this unbalanced equation a 5 in front of the O2 on the left hand side is added to make 10 O's on both sides resulting in\n\n    P4 + 5O2 → P4O10\n\nThe equation is now balanced because there is an equal amount of substances on the left and the right hand side of the equation.\n\nEx #3. C2H5OH + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nThis equation is more complex than the previous examples and requires more steps. The most complicated molecule here is C2H5OH, so balancing begins by placing the coefficient 2 before the CO2 to balance the carbon atoms.\n\n    C2H5OH + O2 → 2CO2 + H2O\n\nSince C2H5OH contains 6 hydrogen atoms, the hydrogen atoms can be balanced by placing 3 before the H2O:\n\n    C2H5OH + O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O\n\nFinally the oxygen atoms must be balanced. Since there are 7 oxygen atoms on the right and only 3 on the left, a 3 is placed before O2, to produce the balanced equation:\n\n    C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O"
As a child I learned my multiplication tables by making up rhymes for them.

I found some sites about multiplication rhymes, hope they help!
"I looked into it for my youngest dd. We attended an hour long presentation that they held about the program. Our state has the virtual homeschool option where you can attend for free if the child begins in kindergarten or has been attending public school, so I looked into it for my dd. There were several drawbacks for our situation which may not be a big deal for others.\n\nFirst of all, the positives about the program include that I think the curriculum is very good. I was impressed with the K12 curriculum. It seemed very good when looking at it. Math, History, Art, everything were standouts, and that was the main reason I was interested in the program. They also provide you with a computer with the program which probably most of us do not need, but is a nice addition to the program.\n\nThe drawbacks for me were: probably the biggest is that they only had so many slots funded by the state, and our state is a  large state. (Probably each state varies with how many slots they fund for the program so I would probably just ask.) Additionally, we were not applying early in the process, did not find out about the program early in the year but towards the end of the application process, and if I was going to bother with the program I would only apply towards the beginning of the application process, not at the end as it probably fills up and if you are submitting your application in the last month or two may not get into the program at all I would think. You also have to do all the paperwork with your pediatrician, etc. and just not worth it if the slots are already full.\n\nThere is quite a bit of teacher interaction which can be a positive for some, probably esp. for those just beginning homeschooling, but for me with several years of experience I thought some of it might be irritating. Your ""supervising"" teacher emails you each day I guess with questions, assignments, or comments or whatever and you are required to check in daily and email back. You also are required to mail in samples of the child's work and exams. You are also required to do the state's standardized testing that they do in the public schools each year (my daughter is special needs-autism spectrum) so I was a little worried about that requirement.\n\nEach month there is a field trip you are required to attend, which would have been a problem for me as I am homeschooling another child. If you have more than one child, even if they are attending the K12 program that could be a problem as the program leader said they break the field trip groups into ages, for example, K-2, 3-5th, etc. so you would have to be in more place than one, since she said the parent is supposed to attend, and my dh usually cannot leave work. So I would have to find someone to babysit my other child who does not attend K12, while I attended the K12 field trip. They sounded pretty inflexible on that one, but what if you have 3 or 4 kids in the program??? I thought that was a very strange requirement for homeschoolers who often do have a lot of children of different ages.\n\nAnyway, I do love the K12 curriculum and think they do have some of the best curriculum out there, just wish they would relax some of their restrictions and prices a bit!"

What is e-learning?\n\nTo avoid any confusion, it is important to define what is meant by 'e-learning'. E-Learning can be defined as the use of technology to deliver, support and enhance teaching, learning, assessment and evaluation.\n\nThe following is a list of different types of e-learning:\n - research using the Internet, digital libraries and/or online databases\n\ninteractive learning materials that provide 'virtual simulated environments'\n\ngroup work using video/Internet conferencing facilities, real-time chat or lectures or discussions delivered via email or mobile devices.\n\nonline assessments\n\nonline communities, e-groups, email discussion groups, online reading groups\n\nPodcasts (audio learning)\n\nThis list could go on as any communication device has the potential to be used for e-learning purposes.\n\nMore about e-learning...\nE-learning is one of the few major innovations in the last two decades that is now able to provide empirical evidence to substantiate its claims. Take up of e-learning globally is huge and still growing. \n\nIt has been seized by commercial enterprises because of its money-saving possibilities, by educational establishments because of its ability to provide varied learning experiences suited to all ages and learning styles. Public sector organisations have found it to be a practical way to distribute fast-changing government information to staff based around the world. \n\nThe key driving force behind adopting e-learning has been to create a more efficient way of imparting knowledge from financial, time, quality and accessibility perspectives.
by graduating college you are now a graduate and can go further to either recive your masters/Phd/ or doctorate by applying to graduate school, although it is not necessary. \n\nwhen you graduate with your degree you are more qualified for certain jobs pertaining to your degree (including both your major and minor)
You can find facts on those individuals by just typing their name into your search engine. Influence is largely opinion, but you can probably find some information on that as well, when you find the websites with facts/bios on them.\n\nHistory is quite interesting...I hope you do well! The research will be worth it, no telling what you may learn.\n\nGood luck!

The title of the course is not what defines your status as a student but the amount of time spent doing that course. If you are attending lectures/lessons on a full time basis then you are a full time student. Part time students usually have a job or something else they are doing at the same time hence only attend lectures/lessons for a few hours a week, say two/three days or just evenings each week or even on line. Such is the ethos of the open university.

add the numbers all together to get 30. then divide 30 by the number of numbers you have in your set of data (6) to get 5. to get the median, you need to put the numbers in least to greatest order. they're already there, so just cross off one number on each side until you end up with one or two numbers in the middle. since there is an even number in this data, you will add the two numbers in the middle and divide the answer by 2.\n\n4+8=12\n12/2=6

Let w = price of wheat flour per pound\nLet r = price of rye flour per pound\n\nFirst we have to set up our system of equations.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n\nNow we will use substitution to solve for a variable.  \n12w + 15r = 18.30\nSubtract 12w from both sides.\n15r = 18.30 - 12w\nDivide both sides by 15.\nr = 1.22 - .8w\n\nNow we substitute r into the other equation.\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15w + 10 (1.22 - .8w) = 16.75\n15w + 12.2 - 8w = 16.75\n7w + 12.2 = 16.75\n7w = 4.55\nw = .65\n\nNow we substitute w back into one of the equations to get r.\n12w + 15r = 18.30\n12(.65) + 15r = 18.3\n7.8 + 15r = 18.3\n15r = 10.5\nr = .7\n\nSo, wheat flour costs $0.65 per pound and rye flour costs $0.70 per pound.\n\n*********************************************************************\n\nNow we can check our answer in the other equation.\n\n15w + 10r = 16.75\n15(.65) + 10(.7) = 16.75\n9.75 + 7 = 16.75\n16.75 = 16.75\n\nWe are good! :)

It depends on what school you are applying to first of all.  Apply as early as you can.  When I was accepted I applied as early as I could and was notified of my acceptance within a month or two if I remember correctly (this was 5 years ago!).  I had a GPA of 3.2 and an ACT of 23 and I was accepted into the school of science.  That being said I went to a very prestigious boarding school and participated in a lot of extra curricular activities.\nAs for scholarships, contact someone at the school and ask them for help.  One of the things I loved most about Purdue is although it is a very large school, I knew all my counselors and professors and spoke with them often.  So you don't get lost in the crowd there!  They are very willing to help!\nhttp://www.purdue.edu/DFA/\nThat is the link for financial aid and scholarships at purdue\nAnd here is their number!  765-494-0998\nBest of luck, I LOVED going to Purdue!!
"""Antoinette"" is a feminine form of the Latin name ""Antonius"" (from which ""Antone"" and numerous variations are derived).\n\nYou will tend to find two basic meanings suggested for the name.   Unfortunately, probably neither is correct.\n\nWhat we DO know is that the Latin name was the surname (family name) of a prestigious Roman family.   The word/name itself is generally thought to be Etruscan... but we do not know what it meant!\n\nAs for the supposed meanings:\n\n1) in the 17th century some English folk surmised that the Latin name was derived from the Greek word ""anthos"" meaning ""flower""  (a root word found in the English word ""anthology""), so they added an ""h"" where there is no evidence one had ever been\n\n2) many baby name sites list the word as from Latin and say it means something like ""priceless"" OR ""praiseworthy, beyond praise"" (not quite the same?!).   But we have no evidence of a Latin word like ""anton"" with this meaning.   Perhaps this idea was suggested as a description of the status of the Roman family that bore this name...  but that is not evidence for the word itself having that meaning.\n\nUnfortunately, this is just one of those cases where we do not know!  (Of course, baby name books and the like will not tell you that!  They have to find something interesting and attradtive to list, so they sometimes pick up ideas with little or no real basis.)  \n\nNote that behindthename.com is an exception to many sites of this sort -- I find it to be careful and reliable.  (And if we don't know something they'll say so!)\n\nhttp://behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=anthony"

Is your question complete?
The Congress of Vienna, while it pretty much stomped over all the minor players, did one thing right: it maintained a balance of strong powers in Europe, and did not let France's internal affairs collapse into a vacuum. Additionally, many of the territorial changes caused by or confirmed by the Congress of Vienna did not cross cultural boundaries or set cultures that already despised each other into the same boundaries.  Where people of a different culture were handed over to other nations, it was usually a case of changing one despised master for another (i.e. Poland). \n\nThe Treaty of Versailles instead rewrote national boundaries without regard to the cultures that lived within said boundaries, creating a host of small, instable nations with differing cultures inside them (Eastern Europe). Additionally, Germany was left with crippling reparations that crushed its already damaged economy, causing the government to weaken and finally collapse into the hands of the Nazi party.
"Zero is neither plural nor singular. It expresses nullity (Hence, it is not singular because it's not 1; Nor it is plural since it's not at least 2). Saying ""There are 0 comments"" or ""There is 0 comment"" are both syntactically correct. In both sentences, 0 (zero) is just a qualifier of comment/comments, specifically as an adjective."

At least in California you can retake a class with a substandard grade (D or F) two more times. The best grade replaces the other two in your GPA. However they won't disappear from your transcripts (they will just not be counted in the GPA). \nI would advice you to withdraw from the class before their Withdrawal deadline if you feel you won't pass the class. A 'W' looks nicer in your transcripts than a D or an F.
"I am 18 years old living in Kang-Dong. (sounds ok)\nI have grown up between my mother, who is an accounting clerk of a small firm, and my father who is a child counselor.

(simplify: I have no siblings) \ntherefore, I think I am very shy. (I think that is why I am very shy)\nMy family was not poor, I did not feel a sort of feeling of lack nor I don't live well.

(Without her permission, I could not choose even what to wear.)\nI don’t know whether that makes it or not, but I have not ever come a department store alone. (Probably for the same reason, I have never been to a department store by myself.) \nShe bought to me for my clothes. (She would shop for my clothes)\nI was ashamed of myself buying alone. (I was ashamed of shopping alone) and I was afraid of going here and there alone by bus.

Because it is plural.  Try any other country and watch what happens when you say The __________countries. ie. Europe and The European countries. Africa and The African countries.\n\nTHE is also used when something is one of a kind and you know what is being talked about ie. The sun The moon (in our own gallaxy system - A sun a moon where there are many rotating around a planet.\nIn daily life if I asked for THE RED BOOk on the shelf. there would be only one red book on the shelf. If there were many I'd have to add a descriptive word such as THE THICK RED BOOK or if I didn't care which book but only wanted a red cover book then I'd ask for A RED BOOK and again if it were many I'd ask either for SOME OR THE OR MANY.\n\nIn th case of the countries you mentioned since they are plural the word THE would be used. Some or many would not stop word THE from being used in referring to these countries.  Just noticed that THESE (plural form) could also be used to plurel countries but adding a noun ie These European countries These United States or these USA states, these Netherland countries. Note the s tranfers to the noun from the two countries you asked about.

"Mea Culpa is a Latin phrase that translates into English as ""my fault"", or ""my own fault"". In order to emphasize the message, the adjective ""maxima"" may be inserted, resulting in ""mea maxima culpa,"" which would translate as ""my most [grievous] fault.""\n\nA fifth column is a group of people which clandestinely undermines a larger group to which it is expected to be loyal, such as a nation.\n\nThe term originated with a 1936 radio address by Emilio Mola, a nationalist general during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. As four of his army columns moved on Madrid, the general referred to his militant supporters within the capital as his ""fifth column,"" intent on undermining the Republican government from within (see also Siege of Madrid (1936-39)).\n\nThe term is also used in reference to a population who are assumed to have loyalties to countries other than the one in which they reside, or who support some other nation in war efforts against the country they live in, which make them traitors.\n\nDuring World War II, German minority organizations in Poland and Czechoslovakia formed the Selbstschutz, which actively helped the Third Reich in conquering those nations and engaged in atrocities. The French Underground is a particularly well-known fifth column.\n\nDuring wars, citizens of enemy countries are often held or watched because of concerns that they might be a fifth column. During World War II, enemy aliens and citizens descended from immigrants from enemy countries were interned throughout Allied and Axis countries, from Japan and Japanese-occupied territories such as the Philippines, to India, Canada and Latin America. This was the justification for the Japanese American internment along the West Coast of the United States and the Japanese Canadian internment in British Columbia, Canada. Selected German and other nationals were also held by various US authorities. Irish Catholic residents in the UK have been sometimes viewed in this way by unionists due to ""The Troubles"" of the late 20th century (see also Guildford Four, Birmingham Six). Recently many Israelis have begun to suggest that Arab citizens of the state constitue a fifth column, citing terrorist-supporting activity by Arab members of parliament (illegal meetings with Hamas terrorists, fundraising, etc.) and not infrequent demonstrations held in Israeli Arab cities in support of Palestinian terror. The recent Israel-Hizbullah war gave Israeli Jews another reason for concern when Israeli Arabs openly supported Hizbullah even as their own cities in northern Israel were being bombed by the Lebanese group.\n\nToday it has a pejorative connotation, whereas partisan can be considered a positive or negative term. Resistance movements are looked upon more favourably than fifth columnists, but it can be argued that there is an overlap between the two."

These can consist of the information stored in the genetic code, but also experimental results from various sources, patient statistics, and scientific literature. Research in bioinformatics includes method development for storage, retrieval, and analysis of the data. Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing branch of biology and is highly interdisciplinary, using techniques and concepts from informatics, statistics, mathematics, chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and linguistics. It  has many practical applications in different areas of biology and medicine.\n\nVR

Most master's programs are 1 or 2 years, depending on the specialty.  A Ph.D. can easily take another 4 to 5 years after the masters (sometimes 7 or 8, if you pick a difficult topic).  A master's thesis usually isn't too in depth, so a basic research project - you'll need to understand all the background material and have done something original.  For a Ph.D., you'll need original, publishable research and a mastery of the background and current research in the field.

try as best you can to get your boyfriend out of the equation.  i would suggest staying at least until the end of the semester, and then think about transferring.  it's still early.  i know you want to be with him, but things can change and going to the same school doesn't guarantee happiness.  \ni'm sure your school has plenty to offer you; you just have to look in the right places.  explore a little more, expand your horizons.  don't forget about your boyfriend, of course, but see if you can keep your mind on other things.\nit's entirely possible that your school isn't right for you.  but you need to give it a fair chance.

Have you approached the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation or the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in your state? They offer programs to help disabled individuals enter the workforce. Also, you might want to try approaching the local welfare or workforce area in your area because they can offer you help, too. The welfare office can be located in the blue pages of the telephone book. The Department/Office of Vocational Rehabilitation can be located by searching your state government's website.
Architects have a wide variety of tools at their disposable.  Old reliable is the scale.  There are two kinds of scales, architect and Engineers scale.  Project type depicts which scale you use.  There are also a wide variety of hand drawing tools like triangles like the 30/60/90 and the 45/45/90.  You can use them together to create a greater variety of angles.  T-squares and french curves are helpful, but if you want to run right into the computer age, there is nothing like using AUTOCAD.  The ease of use and manipulation, and the ability to transform 2-d into a 3-d walkthrough make this an option once you have passed concept and have a concrete design.  Hope this helps.\n\nMatt

if i understand your question, i think you mean how would you deal with being in an uncomfortable environment, i would have to answer truthfully and tell the interview how I felt about the situation.  it really depends what the environment is.  Let's say the environment is being around smokers, then if you don't want that you have to let them know, and not just what the interview wants to hear.   good luck.

Steve Smith over at CPU mag wrote a nice little article on this.
There was no country called Canada in 1840.  Canada became a country in 1867, and of course not all the provinces that are part of Canada today joined Confederation at that time.  Part of what is now Canada was considered the province of Canada, a colony of Britain in 1840.  So you would need to specify what you mean.  Do you mean the population of what constitutes Canada today?\n\nThe population of what was known as Upper Canada at that time was about 455,000 and the population of what was known as Lower Canada was about 697,000.\n\nI hope this helps.
"irony is funny because we know that Malvolio is actually acting very foolishly. Certain parts of the scene mock Malvolio's pretentiousness and snobbery. ""It did come to his hands"" He speaks of himself with 'his' instead of 'my' as if he is someone royal and grand, but he is only a steward. Malvolio is over-confident and has a very high opinion of himself. The love letter he finds does not say that it is for him, it does not say that it is from Olivia either. He just assumes that it is from Olivia to him. When Olivia calls him 'fellow', the usual word referring to a servant, Malvolio is still convinced that Olivia has feelings for him. ""'Fellow'! Not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but 'fellow'"" He interprets everything as himself having all the advantages, such as Olivia calling him 'fellow'. This is comedy of manners (mockery) because it is obvious to everyone else that he interprets things wrongly. Malvolio is the character that has been the most ridiculed in the play. He is made fun of all the time behind his back, especially by the other servants. Maria: ""âyour ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits."" Maria, Sir Toby and Sir Andrew plot against him to ridicule him in front of everyone, mainly Olivia. They are the ones who purposely leave behind the love letter for Malvolio to find. They tell him to wear yellow stockings when they know Olivia hates the colour yellow. They ask him to wear cross-garters when they know this is a fashion Olivia hates. This ridicule is effective because the audience will laugh at a fool, the exact thing that Malvolio is being made into in the play. Shakespeare uses all these different types of humour to make Malvolio appear foolish. Malvolio is exposed as being pretentious and snobbish. Shakespeare tries to encourage the audience to laugh at Malvolio's ignorance as well as his wish to be more than he is - and he has succeededbrilliantly. ..."

I can not give you an essay but i could give you a few pointers. first you should list all your short and mid-term goals, not long term, but goals that you want to complete in the next 1-5 years, right around the time you graduate from high school and/or shortly there after. Once you have those goals, state how this schools program will help you accomplish your goals. Be specific in your answers. I would incorporate a little history about the school as far as merit and the high academic levels (what ever is applicable). Hope this helps.

"Deontological:\nDeontological moral systems are characterized primarily by a focus upon adherence to independent moral rules or duties. Thus, in order to make the correct moral choices, we simply have to understand what our moral duties are and what correct rules exist which regulate those duties. When we follow our duty, we are behaving morally. When we fail to follow our duty, we are behaving immorally.\n\nDeontological moral systems also place some stress on the reasons why certain actions are performed. Thus, simply following the correct moral rules is often not sufficient - instead, we have to have the correct motivations. This would allow a person to not be considered immoral even though they have broken a moral rule, but only so long as they were motivated to adhere to some correct moral duty.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to understand that in deontological moral systems, a correct motivation alone is never a justification for an action and cannot be used as a basis for describing an action as morally correct. It is also not enough to simply believe that something is the correct duty to follow. Duties and obligations must be determined objectively and absolutely, not subjectively.\n\nPerhaps the most significant thing to understand about deontological moral systems is that their moral principles are completely separated from any consequences which following those principles might have. Thus, if you have a moral duty not to lie, then lying is always wrong - even if that results in harm to others. For example, you would be acting immorally if you lied to Nazis about where Jews were hiding.\n\nThe word deontology comes from the Greek roots deon, which means duty, and logos, which means science. Thus, deontology is the ""science of duty."" Key questions which deontological ethical systems ask include:\n\nWhat is my moral duty?\nWhat are my moral obligations?\nHow do I weigh one moral duty against another?\n\nTeleological\nTeleological moral systems are characterized primarily by a focus on the consequences which any action might have (for that reason, they are often referred to as consequentalist moral systems, and both terms are used here). Thus, in order to make correct moral choices, we have to have some understanding of what will result from our choices. When we make choices which result in the correct consequences, then we are acting morally; when we make choices which result in the incorrect consequences, then we are acting immorally.\n\nThe idea that the moral worth of an action is determined by the consequences of that action is often labeled consequentialism. Usually, the ""correct consequences"" are those which are most beneficial to humanity - they may promote human happiness, human pleasure, human satisfaction, human survival or simply the general welfare of all humans. Whatever the consequences are, it is believed that those consequences are intrinsically good and valuable, and that is why actions which lead to those consequences are moral while actions which lead away from them are immoral.\n\nThe various teleological moral systems differ not only on exactly what the ""correct consequences"" are, but also on how people balance the various possible consequences. After all, few choices are unequivocally positive, and this means it is necessary to figure out how to arrive at the correct balance of good and bad in what we do. Note that merely being concerned with the consequences of an action does not make a person a consequentialist - the key factor is, rather, basing the morality of that action on the consequences instead of on something else.\n\nThe word teleology comes from the Greek roots telos, which means end, and logos, which means science. Thus, teleology is the ""science of ends."" Key questions which teleological ethical systems ask include:\n\nWhat will be the consequences of this action?\nWhat will be the consequences of inaction?\nHow do I weigh the harm against th"

"In its original meaning it comes from the US military immediately following WWI. Strangely though, the term was never used to describe anyone - only in order to deny that any such servicemen existed. This bulletin was issued by the U.S. Command on Public Information in March 1919, on behalf of Major General M. W. Ireland, the U.S. Surgeon General:\n\n""The Surgeon General of the Army ... denies ... that there is any foundation for the stories that have been circulated ... of the existence of 'basket cases' in our hospitals.""\n\nThis bulletin was reported on in many U.S. newspapers at the time. Many of them also defined what was meant by 'basket case'. For example, this from the New York paper, The Syracuse Herald, Mar 1919:\n\n""By 'basket case' is meant a soldier who has lost both arms and legs and therefore must be carried in a basket.\n\nGiven that the term was originally reserved for incapacitated servicemen, there wasn't much call for it until the next major war of English-speaking peoples - WWII. Again, it comes from the U.S. military and again in the form of a denial from the Surgeon General. In May 1944, in 'Yank', the then Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, said:\n\n""... there is nothing to rumors of so-called 'basket cases' - cases of men with both legs and both arms amputated.""\n\nClearly, given the scale of the casualties in both wars, there must have been cases of multiple amputation. It isn't recorded what term the U.S. Surgeon General used to describe these - clearly not 'basket case'."

You need a master's degree or postgraduate diploma in either Library and Information Studies or Information Science.  You can complete *any* bachelor's degree and as long as you gain a 2:2 (equivalent to a C) or above you can enrol on one of these postgraduate library courses.\nSo choose any subject(s) you find interesting in college, then when you go to university choose any bachelor's degree you find interesting.  Once you complete your bachelor's degree, find a university which offers one of these library or information courses at master's level and enrol.  Once you've completed your master's degree, you'll be a qualified librarian.

I am not Mormon, but researching and learning about another religion (or even, another culture) will only help you better yourself. You may not see the point in the assignment, but your teacher can fail you and will have cause to do so. The teacher is not asking you agree with Mormonism or defend the religious or except Jesus as your savior, but is asking you to learn about someone else's belief system and lifestyle.\n\nBut then again you are right. I mean, what kind of world would we live in if we started caring about something other than ourselves? What if, God forbid, the Isrealites and the Muslim community learned about one another? What if, again hypothetical, Black people and White people had to learn about each other's past and even go to school together?\n\nI mean, I for one will be damned if I am going to learn about any other religion or culture. I refuse to be asked to learn about Jewish people, or Germany, or Hinduism, or anything else that isn't exactly like me.\n\n(I hope you're picking up on my sarcasm. I'm laying it on pretty thick.)

"Literacy is one of the fastest changing arenas in education today.  The very idea that literacy simply means the ability to read and write is no longer valid (though that is what the word literally means).  The new ideas of literacy focus on students' individual prior knowledge, how they use that prior knowledge to navigate through particular subject matter and finally what the student is able to accomplish.  I have even heard talk (and I don't by into this much, but it is the 'buzz') that literacy doesn't necessarily mean being able to read about baseball, but if the student can tell you about baseball and play baseball, even if they can't read about baseball, is still somewhat literate in that subject.\n\nWhat does this mean for Language teachers?  Hmmm, I don't think it means much other that we have to modify how we view our assesment of student achievement.  We have to be a little more open and creative when monitoring and assessing the education progress of each student taking into account (and being more cognizant of) individual learning styles and modalities.  \n\nThis is a good thing in the fact that you can, with a little (lot) more effort reach more of your students...but it also gives the legislature more slosh room for ""NCLB"" standards and benchmarks.  We still, as Language teachers, have to focus on the reading and writing, but the legislation says that we, and esp. if the IEP states, can now take grades and make alternative assessments if if the child in question is unable to do the classical showing of proficiency (as long as they can, in some way show they have learned the material).\n\nSo, I am not sure if I answered the question as you would have liked.  I am in the habit of being verbose and this particular area can get pretty heavy between petagogy, philosophy, legislation, and personal vision.  All in all the effort is to try and make sure all students are able to show a certain amount of proficiency in a myriad of ways...while (by some miracle) being able to perform adaquately on their particular state's madatory assessment tool.\n\nTO me...I still do my job and expect my students to know and be able to do everything I ask of them...even if it is hard.  I follow state mandates regarding benchmarks, IEP's, ESOL, etc...  I do engage in alternative assessment, but it still is a language class...thus they, in the end, have to be able to read, comprehend and compose proficiently."

Are we speaking about biology here? Sociology? Politics?\n\nI'll assume biology. On the face of it it would seem true, if environmental conditions changed, the species adapting best to exploit it should out compete the others. Speed in reaching the best adaptation would make sure of it. However if a species were to rapidly adapt to aberrant cyclic changes in the environment, that might not guarantee long term success. And mobility and the ability to relocate as conditions changed might have an advantage over adapting to change until that were no longer possible.\n\nSimple algae species have survived for millions of years as more complex species have come and gone.

Those are just disguised factoring problems.\n\nConsider:\n\ncos^3x = cos x\n\ncos^3 x - cos x = 0\n\ncos x(cos^2 x - 1) = 0\n\n-cos x(sin^2 x) = 0\n\nSo cos x = 0 or sin^2 x = 0\n\nand solve from there.\n\nFor the other, note that the equation is quadratic in sin x.  Try the substitution y = sin x:\n\n2y^2 + y + 1 = 0\n\nSolve that for y and resubstitute sin x.

A geographic information system (GIS) is a system for capturing, storing, analyzing and managing data and associated attributes which are spacialy referenced to the earth. In the strictest sense, it is a computer system capable of integrating, storing, editing, analyzing, sharing, and displaying geographically-referenced information. In a more generic sense, GIS is a tool that allows users to create interactive queries (user created searches), analyze the spatial information, and edit data. Geographic information science is the science underlying the applications and systems, taught as a degree program by several universities.\n\nGeographic information system technology can be used for scientific investigations, resource management, asset management, Environmental Impact Assessment, Urban planning, cartography, and route planning. For example, a GIS might allow emergency planners to easily calculate emergency response times in the event of a natural disaster, or a GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection from pollution.

"Added note: I wouldn't say the problem with defining freedom is whether the words are ""positive"" enough. The problem seems more that freedom is ""abstract,"" so differences in degree of freedom are intangible or vague and hard to describe. It is easier to describe in contrast to the lack of freedom, or oppression, where the difference in degree of ""restrictions"" on freedom are concrete and easier to compare.\n\nCan you reword your sentence to explain that since freedom is an abstract concept, the degrees of freedom are intangible and hard to measure or describe in practical terms. So freedom is more easily described in terms of the opposite condition, since degrees of oppression, or restrictions on freedom, are concrete phenomena that are easier to describe in comparison.     \n===========================\nI would drop the first ""positive"" instead.\n\nbecause no other words....\n\ncome across as positive.\nconvey or carry the same positive message.\n\netc.\ncapture the same essence or ideals.\nconnote the same meaning/feeling/intensity.\nare as strong.\nare appropriate or as accurate.\ndefinite it or express it as well\ndescribe it as closely or accurately\nare as ideal.\nare emphatic enough."

Wow! What a horrible situation for you and your little daughter to be in, however she's going to learn a very good lesson on standing up for yourself and having someone stand up for you. \n\nYou can do one of two things. First, the princepal cannot stop you from changing schools. If the other school accepts your daughter (this process takes a week or so), you want to speak directly with the principal, you can transfer her. \n\nIf you don't want to do this your other option is; first, document all dates meetings, outcome of meetings, instances of harassment, ect. Include direct quotes from your daughter, teacher, and principal. Address the school board of the situation and bring copies of documentation and be prepared to present it and have specific goals in mind of what you want to happen (e.g. formal apology from princepal and teacher to you and your daughter and transfer your daughter to another class, ect.). Once the board sees the documentation it will raise a red flag, meaning your next step is getting a lawyer.\n\nIf this doesn't work that's exactly what you're next step will be. Contact your family attorney and if necessary the police (depending on how bad the harassment is don't hesitate to do this and/or file a restraining order) and have them write a formal letter to the school board/district through certified mail ccing the teacher and school board. Make sure it's on the law offices' letterhead. Usually once this is done the school is willing to do anything you want so you don't sue. Follow the legal advice of an attorney and shop around a little to get a second opinion and prices of attorney ahead of meetings. Don't spend more than $200 looking for an attorney and if you're organized enough and depending on the situation you may find one that will work pro-bono (free). \n\nI was in a similar situation when I was little, I was in dyalisis in 2nd grade and my teacher told the class if anyone played with me they would die, she thought it was a funny joke since I had an IV in my hand. An obvious lawsuit waiting to happen. Good luck and you and your family are in my prayers.
Some teachers just got up in front of my class and went through the motions, this is your homework, this is your book, do your work.\nThe best teacher I ever had was a science teacher in 7th grade, she actually cared about all of us, worked hard to do interesting projects in class, took the time to make sure we all understood what was going on, and talked to us on a level that I can say was just a little bit ahead of us. She new our music, she knew the movies we liked, and she knew the way we talked. She had to make a lot of effort to have that much interest in us, and she still is the best teacher I ever had. I know she is still teaching at the same middle school in southern California and I know that the kids have voted her best teacher of the year 3 years in row. She is still the best.\nScience is now my life, and it is because of that one science teacher and the way she taught and the way she brought her life science class to life.

A test is valid when it measures what it is supposed to. It is reliable it yields consistent results. You find out more at:\nhttp://www.georgetown.edu/departments/psychology/researchmethods/researchanddesign/validityandreliability.htm\n\nThe disadvantages of using secondary data:\nYou do not have the control over how the instrument is designed, how they are collected, or how carefully they are manipulated and documented. Another serious trade-off between primary and secondary data is the issue of anomalies; when you are using data you have collected yourself, you have a clear understanding of how those data should appear (in a frequency table, for example). You are more quickly able to spot and correct those anomalies. If you are using someone else's data, you won't necessarily know all of the subtleties that were involved in making coding decisions and in inputting the data.\nhttp://ed.isu.edu/research/Procedures/DataType.htm

You can try, there might be a few smaller colleges out there or state schools. If not, go to the 2 year college, ace all of your classes and then transfer out. Even if you don't get a's in all your classes but do well, there will definitly be a school that will accept you. If you trransfer, no one is going to care about your SAT ever again. And you can always try taking them over again. Rolling admissions can go until March and you can probably talk to your guidance counselor about informing the colleges you have applied to or are going to apply to that you will be taking the test again. I believe the college board is offering another test in December, so you can sign up for that one jst go to their website. If you want to know what colleges you might have a shot at, go to the princetonreview.com they have this neat little thing where you enter in all your stats and then the name of a college and it tells you what kind of chance you have at getting in.
"The Stamp Act\n\n1765, revenue law passed by the British Parliament during the ministry of George Grenville. The first direct tax to be levied on the American colonies, it required that all newspapers, pamphlets, legal documents, commercial bills, advertisements, and other papers issued in the colonies bear a stamp. The revenue obtained from the sale of stamps was designated for colonial defense; while the means of raising revenue was novel, the application of such revenue to defense continued existing British policy. The act was vehemently denounced in the colonies by those it most affected: businessmen, merchants, journalists, lawyers, and other powerful persons. Among these were Samuel Adams, Christopher Gadsden, Patrick Henry, John Dickinson, John Lamb, Joseph Warren, and Paul Revere. Associations known as the Sons of Liberty were formed to organize opposition to the Stamp Act. Merchants boycotted English goods; stamp distributors were forced to resign and stamps were destroyed; and the Massachusetts legislature, at the suggestion of James Otis, issued a call for a general congress to find means of resisting the law. The Stamp Act Congress, which met in Oct., 1765, in New York City, included delegates from New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, South Carolina, Maryland, and Connecticut. The congress adopted the Declaration of Rights and Grievances; it declared that freeborn Englishmen could not be taxed without their consent, and, since the colonists were not represented in Parliament, any tax imposed on them without the consent of their colonial legislatures was unconstitutional. Faced with a loss of trade, Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766.\n\nProposition 13\n\nProposition 13, officially titled the ""People's Initiative to Limit Property Taxation,"" was a ballot initiative to amend the constitution of the state of California. The initiative was enacted by the voters of California on June 6, 1978. It would eventually be upheld as constitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1 (1992). Proposition 13 is embodied in Article 13A of the California Constitution. [1]\n\nIts passage resulted in a cap on property tax rates in the state, reducing them by an average of 57%. In addition to lowering property taxes, the initiative also contained language requiring a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses for future increases in all state tax rates or amounts of revenue collected, including income tax rates. Proposition 13 received an enormous amount of publicity, not only in California, but throughout the United States. Passage of the initiative presaged a ""taxpayer revolt"" throughout the country that is thought to have contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980."

"Coltan is the colloquial African name for (columbite-tantalite), a metallic ore comprising niobium and tantalum. Mineral concentrates containing tantalum are usually referred to as 'tantalite' [1]. In appearance, coltan is a dull black mineral.\n\n\nProduction and supply\nThe main production of tantalum occurs in Australia [2], where the largest producer, Sons of Gwalia, operates two mines. Tantalum minerals are also mined in Canada, Brazil, China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (80% of the world known reserves). Tantalum is also produced in Thailand and Malaysia as a by-product of tin mining and smelting.\n\nThe main supply is found in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It is also found and sometimes produced in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Egypt.\n\n\nUse and Demand\nTantalum is used primarily for the production of capacitors, which are vital components in electronic devices, ranging widely from mobile phones to laptop computers. The upsurge in tech products over the past decade has resulted in extraordinary demands and price increases for the mineral [3]. These price increases have contributed to tension in the producing countries, particularly between Congo and Rwanda.\n\n\nProblems\nThe Congo is a politically unstable area and the mining area is also within one of the main ranges of the threatened Eastern Lowland Gorilla.\n\nThe Rwandan occupation in the east of the Congo has meant the DRC has been unable to exploit the resource for its own benefit. A recent UN Security Council report charged that a great deal of the ore is mined illegally and smuggled over the country's eastern borders by militias from neighbouring Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda. Estimates have indicated the Rwandan army profited at least $250 million in as little as 18 months from the sale of Coltan. However, these estimates are problematic as Rwanda possesses its own coltan deposits, making the smuggled mineral difficult to identify.\n\nColtan smuggling has also been implicated as a major source of income for the military occupation of Congo. To many, this raises ethical questions akin to those of conflict diamonds. Owing to the difficulty of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate mining operations, several electronics manufacturers have decided to forgo central African Coltan altogether, relying on other sources.\n\nAll three countries named by the United Nations as smugglers of coltan have denied being involved. Austrian journalist Klaus Werner has documented links between multi-national companies and the illegal coltan traffic [1].\n\nIt is also alleged that coltan mining could have severe environmental repercussions on the forests and wildlife in the area, in particular the Gorilla, as noted.\n\n\nPrice increases and changing demands\nThere has been a significant drop in the production and sale of coltan and niobium from African mines since the dramatic price spike in 2000, based on dot com speculation and multiple ordering. This is confirmed in part by figures from the United States Geological Survey [2] [3].\n\nThe Tantalum-Niobium International Study Centre in Belgium (a country with traditionally close links to the Congo), has encouraged international buyers to avoid Congolese coltan on ethical grounds:\n\n""The central African countries of Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda and their neighbours used to be the source of significant tonnages. But civil war, plundering of national parks and exporting of minerals, diamonds and other natural resources to provide funding of militias has caused the Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center to call on its members to take care in obtaining their raw materials from lawful sources. Harm, or the threat of harm, to local people, wildlife or the environment is unacceptable.""[4] \nHowever, for economic, rather than ethical reasons, a shift is also being seen from traditional sources such as Australia,"

I am that dull person with no expression in real life, although I can open up when I feel like it. \n\nWe quiet types like to examine other people alot. If I am listening to a conversation to which I have nothing to add, then often I just zone out and stop listening, and I start examining facial expressions and body language of people around the group.\n\nOne thing I notive is that if you want people to listen to you, eyes are of key importance. Eyes can show a full range of emotion all by themselves. If you want proof go see a Blue Man Group peformance. They never speak, and never move their faces at all. They let their eyes tell the story, and the effect is fantastic. Do the same in coversation. Open your eyes wide, and look interested in what you have to say!\n\nBe confident, and smile.

Interactive whiteboards e.g Smartboard provide a large screen where students can move items, annotate, discuss video clips - the size and interactivity promotes discussion and questioning.  You can also use handheld devices and do learning in small groups 'on the go' - check out Futurelab mediascape as an example.  Again it adds additional material which provides points for discussion.  Another good tool is Turning point - it can save lots of time as you get instant feedback on answers so the teacher can tell how the group is getting on or how they feel about their work - it's also fun.  Many schools use laptops - can be an individual use, but also you can get students to collaborate e.g. on research or making video clips to illustrate their learning.  The most important point, no matter what tool you use, is that you consider how the students will use it and how the technology will enhance their learning - will it encourage them to research in more depth or to discuss their work in more detail, or to explore it in a 3D rather than flat dimension.

b) Why there are four masses here 1 small guy + 3 big guy = 4.  Divide 4 into 20, you get 5.  But that is only half the answer.  The big guy's mass is an anchor for the small guy.  So every time the big guy pulls he just pulling the small guy closer and every time the small guy pulls he is moving closer in a ratio of 3 to 1.  So the big guy only moves 5m and the small guy move 15m.

The top schools are looking for kids who will work their butts off, who have a proven record of working their butts off, and who will continue to work their butts off to make the world a better place in the future.  Who really has the potential to be the next leaders?  Who will use school for what it is - a stepping stone to greatness - rather than an end in itself?  \n\nIf you take the attitude school is an end in itself, not part of a greater future, you diminish your chances.

"They are a franchise, and therefore, supposed to be essentially the same throughout anywhere they are established.  The ONLY difference I've noticed in McDonald's in the US and other countries is that the US is (I think) the only country that does not use the metric system.  Therefore we have ""quarter pounders"".  Other countries don't use the ""pound"" in their weights and measures system.  So, for instance, if you were to go to France and order a ""quarter pounder with cheese"" they would look at you funny.  In France, it's called a ""Royale with cheese"".  That is the ONLY difference I've seen though.  As far as the taste of the food and if there are any differences in taste and quality, nope..they're all the same."

"College admissions are about a lot more than test scores; the strength of your personal statement, HS transcript, recommendations, extracurriculars, and personal interview (if you have one) all will play into admissions. Other factors such as your socioeconomic status and race may come into play also.\n\nYour scores specifically will almost certainly not prevent you from getting into college, presuming you apply to a variety of schools, write a good essay, and have reasonably good grades (for example, getting grades in the B range, or better, with only a few C's). At over 2000 colleges listed on the ""College Matchmaker"" under the student section of collegeboard.com the middle range of students (between the 25th and 75th percentiles) - the 'average' student - has scores on par or below yours. Your scores aren't bad at all - in fact, of all 2006 SAT test takers, your verbal and writing are only about 70 points under average and your math is about 100 points above average! And at that, many schools aren't even yet considering the writing portion of the exam, your lowest score, because it is new. So your scores are not bad at all; they are well within the average. \n\nThis is not to say that you will have to settle for the 'average' college. It is rare, though not unheard of, for someone with your score to get into highly competitive schools, but you will need to be an exceptional candidate in other areas in order to do so. If you have your heart set on a school that is a 'reach' for you based on your scores and/or high school GPA  (you can check out  the average SAT scores of students at potential schools for you at collegeboard.com) then you probably should take the SATs again if you have time/money, haven't done so already, and think you will improve.  \n\nBut either way, don't stress! If you haven't already, get a list of colleges you're ready to apply to  - one or two that you definitely will get into (with a majority of students of your profile achieving below what you have achieved in SATs/GPA), one or two  reach (with the average student surpassing your scores/grades), and some in the middle. If you have decent grades and put time and thought into the application process, you will find yourself successful."

The most effective study hours are when you are most alert.  For most people, this will be more than an hour after your last meal, not too late in the day or too early.  For me, this is from 9-12 AM, and from 1-4 PM.  If you must study other times, my advice is to change the WAY you study.  The most effective way to study is the way that makes the content interesting to you.  Find something about it that you are interested in, or a reason why you can be motivated to learn it.  Also, if you learn best by reading, read the content.  If you learn best by listening, tape the lecture and listen to it again.

I just didn't attend school the day they gave it, and never made it up.  My sister took it and recruiters were calling all the time.  My kids aren't in high school yet, but if that is how they do things, I would call the school and tell them my child is not taking it.  Verbal consent is just as credible than written when it comes to public school.

It depends on whether you are creating a questionnaire or filling one out.\n\nIf you are creating one then someone must have told you what information they need gathered. Just include those questions phrased in a clear way so that it is obvious what is being asked for. Otherwise the replies will be useless.\n\nIf you are filling it out then just say whatever is relevant to your house. If it is from the tax assessor don't volunteer additional info not requested or your assessment might go up unnecessarily.

I did find a lot on this subject, but the issue is that these journals require a paid subscription if you want to have access to them on line. Try your university's library.

"Beverly Hills High School has had a well for years.\n\nOwned by the Venoco Oil Company, an oil well on Beverly's campus can easily be seen by drivers heading west on Olympic Boulevard towards Century City. The oil well has drilled most of the oil out of Beverly's campus, and has been slant drilling under many homes and apartment buildings in Beverly Hills for decades.\n\nAs of May 2006, the Beverly Hills High School well was pumping out 400 to 500 barrels a day, earning the school approximately $300,000 a year in royalties.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, an art studio volunteered to cover the well, which at that point was solid gray in color, with individual tiles that had been painted by kids with cancer. The studio created the design and drew the lines on the tiles, but children painted the tiles in between the lines. The studio made the design rather abstract: the design consists of random shapes on different-colored backgrounds. A ceremony inaugurating the design was held in 2001. The project's name was ""Project 9856."" \n\nBeverly gained more notoriety when Erin Brockovich and Ed Masry filed three lawsuits in 2003 and 2004 on behalf of 25, 400, and 300 (respectively) former students who attended Beverly from the 1970s until the 1990s. The lawsuits claim that toxic fumes from the oil well caused the former students to develop Hodgkin's lymphoma or cancer. The oil well is very close to all of Beverly's sports facilities, including the soccer field, the football field, and the racetrack. Beverly students -- not just athletes but students taking required physical education classes from the 1970s until the 1990s -- were required to run near the oil well. The city, the school district, and the oil companies named as plaintiffs dispute this assertion, claiming that they have conducted air quality tests with results showing that air quality is normal at the high school.\n\nAfter receiving numerous complaints about Beverly's oil well, the region’s air quality agency investigated Venoco Oil and in 2003 found the company guilty of violating three air pollution regulations. Venoco's punishment included a requirement that the company maintain continuous air quality monitoring at the high school."
"Here is an interpretation of that theme in the novel ...\n\n""Although the old man seemingly fails once the sharks steal his prize fish, they cannot take away the fact that Santiago -- the primary target for the jest and pity of other fishermen -- has done the unthinkable by staying with and catching a fish ""bigger than he had ever heard of"". According to the ""Hemingway Code,"" based on principles of courage and endurance, the old man has actually triumphed in spite of his loss. In spite of not successfully bringing the fish back, Santiago fights with dignity -- first to land the marlin, then to protect his fish from the sharks -- and in doing so asserts his humanity. Santiago endures and successfully survives his supreme ordeal, fighting the timeless battle of man vs. fate, with honor by remaining resilient in the face of triumph and tragedy.""\n\nThese sites should help you.

Are you male or female? Is this a grammar question?
"I think the answer might be in here...\n\nOnce upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, \nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-- \nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, \nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. \n""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-- \nOnly this, and nothing more."" \n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; \nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. \nEagerly I wished the morrow;-- vainly I had sought to borrow \nFrom my books surcease of sorrow-- sorrow for the lost Lenore-- \nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-- \nNameless here for evermore. \n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain \nThrilled me-- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; \nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating, \n""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-- \nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-- \nThis it is, and nothing more."" \n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, \n""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; \nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping, \nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, \nThat I scarce was sure I heard you""-- here I opened wide the door;-- \nDarkness there, and nothing more. \n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing, \nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before; \nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, \nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!"" \nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""-- \nMerely this, and nothing more. \n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, \nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. \n""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice: \nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-- \nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-- \n'Tis the wind and nothing more."" \n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, \nIn there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; \nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; \nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-- \nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-- \nPerched, and sat, and nothing more. \n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, \nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, \n""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven, \nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-- \nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"" \nQuoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."" \n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, \nThough its answer little meaning-- little relevancy bore; \nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being \nEver yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-- \nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, \nWith such name as ""Nevermore."" \n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only \nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. \nNothing further then he uttered-- not a feather then he fluttered-- \nTill I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before-- \nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."" \nThen the bird said, ""Nevermore."" \n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, \n""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store, \nCaught from some unhappy master whom u"

Under this component, pollution abatement works are being taken up along the Gomti river in Lucknow, Sultanpur and jaunpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. About 269 mld of sewage is targeted to be intercepted, diverted and treated under this action plan.\n\n\nOut of the project outlay of Rs. 58.11 crore, an amount of Rs. 7.21 crore has been released by the GoAP. Subsequent to the CCEA’s(Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs) approval in 1993, the Gomti Action Plan was posed to the UK Govt. for funding. \n\n     The UK Govt. agreed to fund pollution abatement works in lucknow town only, in two phases. The first phase comprising certain emergency works and the master plan preparation, was completed in March, 1999. However, the Govt. of UK delayed the decision for funding the main action programme (under the Second Phase of its project) and finnaly in August, 1997 refused to fund it.  \n\n     Thus, work under the major component of Gomti Action Plan (out of the total CCEA provision of Rs 58.11 crore for schemes implementation under GoAP, about Rs 50 crore is for Lucknow) could not be started even four years after the approval of the CCEA. Subsequently, the Govt. of UP submitted revised cost estimates for Rs. 237.40 crore, far in excess of the originally approved outlay. \n\n    The reason for UK govt's refusal to sanction the money is unkown. Hope this information is sufficient for your question.

"The most basic aspects of traditional Western symbology – that white signifies purity and black signifies evil – are repeatedly challenged in Othello. One example is in the character of Bianca. Her name in Italian means ""white"", yet, as Iago tells the audience, her name is again ""but sign"" of purity, as she is in fact ""a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes"" (Act IV, scene i, ll. 95-96). Ironically, just before Desdemona pleads with Othello that she is not a whore, Bianca too protests to an accuser that she is ""no strumpet, but of life as honest/ As you that thus abuse me"" (Act V, scene i, ll. 122-123)– leading the audience to realize that, just as with Desdemona, the only evidence anyone has that Bianca is a whore is Iago's word, and Cassio's (he calls her a ""customer,"" whore {Act IV, scene i, l. 120}).\n\nHeaven nevertheless remains a signifier of truth, and hell a signifier of misrepresentation in the play. The words thus recur frequently throughout Othello, as Othello struggles to join other signifiers to them: for example he says to an innocent Desdemona that ""Heaven doth truly know that thou art false as hell"". This shows strong contrasts between the two.\n\nhttp://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/xOthello.html#Othello\nDon't know whether it will help but it is a pretty good guide."

they banned it because in the constitution it says that america would not have an official religion. therefore, anyone can have the freedom to  practice their religion here or believe in whatever they want. we may not pray in school but we do have a 30 second moment of silence. so you can pray then if you wanted.  If you  really want prayer in school go to a parochial school.  i used to go to one.  In a public school you can join a religious club and pray there also.

If so, then youll probably be taking mostly sciences (chem, bio) and it doesnt really matter where you live.  Only your biochem and biomed classes will be on west campus (closer to north side).  If your on South side, the commons are best.  None of the dorms are stellar but the commons is one of the best.  Living on campus the first year is fun...youll make friends in ANY dorm you choose!  Congrats on getting in!  Gig Em!

You'll often get langauge training just like a linguistics major, yet you also get a lot of other topics covered at the same time. I would say the languages are the more important part though, so find an IR program that gives you at least a minor in a language, or major in a language and minor in IR.

"I found a few websites that offer snorkels longer than 12 inches, but one in particular had this to say...\n\n""The length of a snorkel is only about 12 inches long. So why not just make longer and longer snorkels? If you tried to breathe through a garden hose while on the bottom of a swimming pool, you would find that you couldn't. The pressure pushing in on your chest and lung muscles is too great to allow you to take a breath.""\n\nI imagine that's why 12 inches is the optimum length...unless you have really big lungs."

A diploma indicates completion of high school course work.\n\nAn associate's degree indicates completion of a 2-year (usually technical) degree, most likely at a community college.\n\nA bachelor's degree indicates completion of a 4-year college/university coursework. \n\nA master's degree is earned after the bachelor's, and can last anywhere from 1-3 years depending on the school and major. You can either study what you studied as an undergrad, or choose a new area to study for a master's.\n\nPhD and Doctoral degrees are the advanced degrees earned by doctors, lawyers, and other high-ranking professionals. These advanced programs are tailored directly to the field they plan to work in.
Involuntary muscles are smooth, uninucleated, non-branching muscles that are not directly controllable at will. These include the radially arranged iris muscles, the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and are all controlled by the autonomic nervous systemThese muscles are not as free as the voluntary muscles such as your arms legs, fingers, etc..\n\nThe cardiac muscle in heart can be called an involuntary muscle, although it may be classified separately due to its structural differences. it is controlled by nerve impulses produced by a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, the rate of which is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. smooth muscles are found in the digestive system, reproductive system, major blood vessels, the skin and internal organs, and is also controlled by the autonomic nervous system.\n\nSkeletal muscle is under conscious control and is, therefore, voluntary muscle.\n\n voluntary muscles =Somatic nervous system=The somatic nervous system is that part of the peripheral nervous system associated with the voluntary control of body movements through the action of skeletal muscles, and also reception of external stimuli. The somatic nervous system consists of afferent fibers that receive information from external sources, and efferent fibers that are responsible for muscle contraction.\n\nThe somatic system includes all the neurons connected with the muscles, sense organs and skin. It deals with sensory information and controls the movement of the body.\n\nThe basic route of the efferent somatic nervous system includes a two neuron sequence. The first is the upper motor neuron, whose cell body is located in the precentral gyrus (Brodman Area 4) of the brain. It receives stimuli from this area to control skeletal (voluntary) muscle. The upper motor neuron carries this stimulus down the corticospinal tract and synapses in the ventral horn of the spinal cord with the alpha motor neuron, a lower motor neuron. The upper motor neuron releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs and these are received by nicotinic receptors on the alpha motor neuron. The alpha motor neurons cell body sends the stimulus down its axon via the ventral root of the spinal cord and proceeds to its neuromuscular junction of its skeletal muscle. There, it releases acetylcholine from its axon terminal knobs to the muscles nicotinic receptors, resulting in stimulus to contract the muscle.

Well, I myself am slightly older then your daughter, and I have never been invited to that particular conference. I have however taken part in others that are similar, for high school teens. \n\nPersonally, I will always remember the convention. I had an amazing time. I too was skeptical when I first learned that it would be $2800 for 5 days in Washington DC, but after I went, it was worth every penny. I met a lot of people who had similar interests as myself, and I also learned a Lot...as mine was a seminar type leadership conference. \n\nNow, don't let it sound like I'm trying to push you to send your daughter, there are some things to keep in mind. First and foremost, your daughter will be without you for the week that shes there. Now, if your daughter is very independent, and doesn't mind being separated with you for that period of time, then thats not a problem. You should also keep in mind the financial cost of it. The $1800 that your paying does not pay for transport to and from the location. You will also need to send some money with your daughter to cover any emergency costs, although this particular program is fairly good. Most programs wont cover all the food costs, especially if your on a trip.\n\nAll in all, I think that if your daughter goes, she will have a LOT of fun, maybe learn a few new things, and probably make friends that she will hold on to for years to come. Just make sure you weigh all the sides before you make a choice. Ill remind you that there are LOTS more conventions when she gets older, especially if she is as bright as you say she is. If you don't feel comfortable sending her now, then hold off for a few more years, and send her to another program when she hits middle school, or high school.\n\nBest of luck with the decision, \nand please, feel free to contact me if you have any questions,\npyro_briar@yahoo.com
I believe the actual test is 4.5 hrs. However, you have to get there early, and there are breaks, so it winds up taking about 5 or 6 hrs to get to the center, take the test, and get home.
"There was a single Sphinx in Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck, according to Hesiod a daughter of Echidna and of Orthrus or, according to others, of Typhon and Echidna — all of these chthonic figures. She was represented in vase-painting and bas-reliefs most often seated upright rather than recumbent, as a winged lion with a woman's head; or she was a woman with the paws, claws and breasts of a lion, a serpent's tail and eagle wings. Hera or Ares sent the Sphinx from her Ethiopian homeland (the Greeks remembered the Sphinx's foreign origin) to Thebes and, in Sophocles Oedipus Tyrannus, asks all passersby history's most famous riddle: ""Which creature in the morning goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in the evening upon three?"" She strangled anyone unable to answer. The word ""sphinx"" comes from the Greek Σφινξ — Sphinx, apparently from the verb σφινγω — sphingo, meaning ""to strangle"". This may be her proper name, but The Penguin Dictionary of Classical Mythology states that her given name was Φιξ — Phix. Oedipus solved the riddle: man — he crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and walks with a cane in old age. Bested at last, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. The exact riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of the story and was not standardized as the one given above until much later in Greek history.[2] Thus Oedipus can be recognized as a liminal or ""threshold"" figure, helping effect the transition between the old religious practices, represented by the Sphinx, and new, Olympian ones."

Good for you, for wanting to help her with this process!  Too many parents would just stand back and hope she could find a way to do this.  There are several ways you can approach this.  If you have a family dentist with whom she has a good relationship, she (or you) could ask her/him for help with the process.  There are many websites, like www.collegeboard.com, which give information - she needs to prepare for the SAT, if she hasn't already taken that exam, and she should get help with her essays and financial aid applications.  Be careful, by the way, about rip-off companies which take your money and promise financial aid; I've seen too many people taken in by these sleazy people.  Once she gets accepted at a college, they should be able to work with her to get financial aid that she (and you) doesn't have to pay for up front.  The suggestion about community college counselors was a good one, and if you have any money, there are professional independent college counselors you can get advice from.  I can tell you that I'm a college professor, and many of us love it when high school students who are interested in our fields come to us for advice.  I don't know enough about the sciences, or I'd volunteer to help her myself!

That's a great book.  You should actually read it.
"In my opinion, do what you have to do to adapt. \n\nPlenty of people in years past got through and did so without excuses. I have ADHD, and a craptastic memory. But I have relied on compensatory devices, mnemonics, tape recorders, associations (e.g. neighbor named savannah, I think of girl-scout cookies), etc.\n\nSo I use technology, ranging from my PDA to the old fashioned notebook to keep up with everything. I have a heavy load atm in the nursing program...8-10 chapters every couple of weeks, with skills labs, care plans, hospital rotations, yada yada yada. \n\nAnd hey, I've always had to go through information two the three times longer than your average student but I'm keeping up with this very heavy courseload. \n\nThing is, you just have to adapt to the situation and get your responsibilities taken care of. Few people in life have everything laid out for them, the rest of us have to keep up and work on our weaknesses where we can.\n\nFailure is the price of laziness, and not being prepared. \n\nToo many people want to look for an excuse to explain away their shortcomings. Or better yet, want to cast blame. But like ya said, the teachers can only do so much. Problem is that this society has begun to frown on recognizing greatness, frowns on the use of red pens because they are too ""negative,"" frowns on creating standards that separate the hard working from those who don't add up.\n\nThen the problem is exacerbated when you consider there are so many parents out there that have no damn business being parents. Or the politicians more concerned with garnering votes that keeping the bar raised to an internationally competitive level.\n\nHell I could go on and on. Basically, it's the fault of the republicans, the democrats, the parents, the kids, the teachers, society in general, the pharmacological ass-kissers, my dog sam, and a bunch of other pricks I'm probably not even thinking about atm. \n\nI really could go on and on all day...but basically the moral of this is that the school should do nothing. The schools are there just to provide a foundation. It is the responsibility of society as a whole to make sure that students are prepared, that they have the resources available to them, and that everyone doesn't come out a freaking moron who isn't prepared for life.\n\nThe main problem with medications is that they only treat the symptoms, not the underlying problems. In many cases this is the only option, but hey consider all the kids you know on ADD drugs...hyperactive, failure to concentrate, poor social skills...that is EVERY child I have EVER freaking known! Where I come from, that's normal. \n\nBut get some jerk doctor in the new health care system where ""patients"" magically become ""customers"" (crock of $#!* if you ask me) , who will quickly throw a prozac, ritilin, etc. at a patient just to make them feel like they've done something...and the problem is exacerbated. \n\nMeanwhile those who are trully suffering and could benifit from a more disciplined approach falter as pills are thrown at them. \n\nWith all of this having been said, i'll take psychologists and their drugs over tom cruise and the scientology group any day. \n\nWow want a whiney rant, sorry if that doesn't answer your question and hey, hopefully it helped anyway."
"Dutch reckoning - a bill that is presented without any details, and which only gets bigger if you question it; \nDutch widow - a prostitute\nDutch auction - one in which the prices go down instead of up; \nDutch courage - temporary bravery induced by alcohol; \nDutch metal - an alloy of copper and zinc used as a substitute for gold foil; \nDutch comfort or Dutch consolation - where somebody might say ""thank God it is no worse!""; \nDutch concert - each musician plays a different tune; \nDutch uncle - someone who criticises or rebukes you with the frankness of a relative.\nDutch treat - sharing the payment of something"
I believe the time consuming way is the better option.\n  Highlighting would be okay if you looked it over every day rather than waiting until the end of the semester at exam time.\n  I learned to study by taking notes during the reading or lectures.  Rewriting them clearly the same day.  Then each day look them over from start to what gets added each class.  It doesn't take long to scan over them daily and when it's time for the test you don't have to stress or even do anything more.  It has already gotten into your head a little each day and having the structure of your notes repeated,  your ability to recall specific facts will return in that same order.\n  It worked great for me.

The ealiest flame throwers date as far back as 5th century BC, which was a tube filled with burning solids, such as sulfer or coal, and worked like a blow gun (you blow through one end of the tube to prepel fire at the target). The flamethrower was refined over the following centuries. The models seen in the early days of WW I were developed at the turn of the 20th century.  The German army tested two models of flamethrower - or Flammenwerfer in German - in the early 1900s, one large and one small, both developed by Richard Fiedler.
To be culturally aware is to understand one's own identity and that impact on society, family, and the world beyond.  If you know who you are, you are able to be both tolerant and willing to know someone else, no matter how they identify themselves.  With those two identities in play, cultural awareness builds.

There are several online universities that are worth looking into and which one you choose will depend on what you want to major in (just as you would choose a traditional universities). Many companies recognize the degrees from online universities because, as we all know, computers are the wave of the future.

The Cape Verde islands experienced the longest period of European colonization of any African nation. The Portuguese remained in direct control of this island archipelago from 1460 to 1975. In their struggle for independence from Portugal, beginning in the 1950s, the people of Cape Verde linked their fortunes to that of Guinea Bissau on the West African mainland under a unified movement, the PAIGC (African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde), formed in 1956.The armed struggle against the Portuguese lasted from 1963 until 1974 when a negotiated peace settlement was arranged. While achieving independence for themselves, the Portuguese African resistance movements, including those of Angola and Mozambique, had succeeded in bringing down the fascist Portuguese government in Lisbon. Elections were held in June 1975, and the Republic of Cape Verde was declared formally independent from Portugal on 5 July.\n\nAlso check out http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-129476/Cape-Verde\n\nHope some of this helps =)

"The pythagorean theorem is c^2 = a^2 + b^2\n\nWhich means if you drew a straight line between the two points, you would have ""c"", which is the long side of a right triangle.  ""a"" and ""b"" form the sides.\n\nSo in your first example, -2 and 3 represent the ""width"", or horizontal edge, of your triangle.  Subtract the smaller value from the larger to get the length:\n\na = 3 - (-2)\na = 5\n\n-1 and 11 represent the ""height"", or vertical edge:\n\nb = 11 - (-1)\nb = 12\n\nSo your equation is this:\nc ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + b ^ 2\nc ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 + 12 ^ 2\nc ^ 2 = 25    + 144\nc ^ 2 = 169\nc = 13\n\nSo the distance between E and F is 13."

I know a man whose pride will not allow him to forgive his wife's adultery... yet this same man has committed adultery with several females over time, but as his wife doesn't know, he sees her as being in the wrong. His pride will not allow forgiveness, so five years on, they live together in separates floors of their home, her affair goes on in the open still, she went back to him after punishment at home was never ending. \n\nHis affairs continue to flourish in small numbers. He plays away and so as she doesn't see, she doesn't know, and somehow, she is still wrong, because he's wiped from memory the ones he had before she joined the ranks. \n\nPride blinds us to ourselves, it blinds us to the feelings and the needs of those we care about, and it is something that gets in the way of personal growth.\n\nSelf esteem, now that's a very different thing, it is something that we all must have to cope with life's hurdles, the failed job application, the loss of lover, the loss of home and place and acceptance all require our self esteem to kick in, since only with it can we go onward and progress and turn tragedy and heartache, loss and humiliation all around.

I understand you want the only the name, but you already have two different answers.  Read the following for your answer:\n\nOn 10 December 1868, the first traffic lights were installed outside the British Houses of Parliament in London, by the railway engineer J.P. Knight. They resembled railway signals of the time, with semaphore arms and red and green gas lamps for night use. The gas lantern was turned with a lever at its base so that the appropriate light faced traffic. Unfortunately, it exploded on 2 January 1869, injuring the policeman who was operating it.\n\nOn Potsdamer Platz, Berlin Germany, it is widely claimed (though this is subject to some disagreement), that the world's first electric street lights were installed there in 1882. What is not refuted is that Europe's first traffic lights were erected there in 1924 in an attempt to control the sheer volume of traffic passing through. These lights were mounted on a five-sided 8.5 metre high tower, at the top of which a policeman sat in a small cabin and switched the lights manually, though they were automated after a few years (a replica of this tower was erected in the late 1990s close to its original location).\n\nThe modern electric traffic light is an American invention.[4] As early as 1912 in Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire set up the first red-green electric traffic lights. On 5 August 1914, the American Traffic Signal Company installed a traffic signal system on the corner of 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio. Based on the design of James Hoge, it had two colors, red and green, and a buzzer to provide a warning for color changes. The first four-way, three-color traffic light was created by police officer William Potts in Detroit in 1920.[1] In 1923, Garrett Morgan patented a traffic signal device, although it did not directly impact the evolution of the modern traffic light.

"When my college hosts lecturers, I'm bound to stay interested if the lecturer is able to engage the student audience by being knowledgeable about the topic, asking the group questions, and relating it to other things (especially if the concept is more abstract or you are talking on one particular subject to a diverse group).  \n\nPersonally, if a lecturer doesn't grab my interest within the first 10 minutes, I'm likely to note my escape routes and enact one of them in a relatively quick fashion.  The best lecturers I've seen grab students' interest nearly immediately, usually with humor.  Don't use a cheesy joke and definitely be sure to test the joke out on an honest coworker first.  \n\nIf you've succeeded in obtaining my interest, tell me what you going to talk to me about in a general sense.  I don't like to be lost.  I will start looking for those escape routes again so that I can find myself located in a nice lobby, that I call ""Freedom.""\n\nOnce you've explained the general, go into detail on some of the specifics. Judge your group before you get give the lecture.  How much information can they process?  Also, remember time constraints.  In a student's mind, a two hour lecture starting at 6 means ""I had dinner right before I came and will need to use the bathroom at some point. If I leave, and find the Lobby of Freedom, I will not return.""\n\nUse some sort of multimedia unless you are an incredibly engaging orator.  I have seen several successful non-multimedia presentation.  I have seen some...well, no, I haven't. I left at the 40 minute mark when I decided that I had counted the ceiling tiles too many times and even my professor was asleep.  Don't read off of PowerPoint slides or have cheesy animations on them.  If you have all the words on your PowerPoint and are simply reading off of it, I know a fifth grader who could give a better presentation...using your slides.  Don't hesitate to ask questions if you think the audience can handle them (and will answer them). Remember, in order to have them answer them, you need to have already engaged the group.\n\nWrap up with going back to a general sense.  Tie up loose ends.  Ask for questions or ask them yourself. When you answer questions, repeat the question to the whole audience. Sometimes the back row couldn't hear it.  It also helps so that you actually answer the question.  Nothing upsets an audience member more than you neglecting to give a real answer to a question and going off on some other tangent. \n\nWhen you leave, be open to meet people in the lobby afterward. It makes a great impression.\n\nMost important to remember, don't be cheesy.  Cheese smells bad."

Of course it depends on the type of plane and its capabilities.  But, I suggest you check the FAA web site.   I am sure there is leeway, but generally I think altitudes are prescribed depending on the direction you are going.  For ex, planes going in one direction fly at even altitudes, while planes in the opposite direction fly at odd altitudes.\n\nThen, I think the airlines have some say depending on wind conditions and weather at those altitudes.\n\nMy recent flights were like 37 or 39 thousand feet.  But I was shocked on the flight from Houston to Honolulu 32 or 33 thousand.\n\nGood luck.

I did a Double Honours degree; you do the 'core' of two majors, rather than a major and a minor. Thid adds up to more time and longer essays than a major and minor, and takes quite a lot of self control (because you will have a favourite, but must remember that both are equally important and you need to spend equal time on both). \n\nMany people assume it is just a case of being a fast worker and having the correct 'academic' ability, but I would add time management and self-control/discipline to this. You have to be able to prioritise for yourself- if you have a major/minor at Uni, this is decided for you, but with a double hons it is down to your own willpower.

Vivien Thomas could not have have abandoned his scientific work at Johns Hopkins University to fulfill his dreams of attending college and medical school. But he should have.\n\n1. He deserved the opportunity to attend medical school. It was his dream. He did all the scientific work in the discovery of open heart surgery and had no credentials to support his findings. Therefore, he gave Dr. Blalock the opportunity to take credit for his accomplishments. But as it was previously mentioned, the time in which the event took place has to be taken in consideration. Even if he had finished medical school, it is possible that he would not have received the proper credit. He just wasted alot of time, and until recently had little to show for it. And furthermore, had he the opportunity to attain his medical degree, he could have the autonomy to develop his own research. \n\n2. One would be remiss in not mentioning the fact that Blalock's pride kept him from allowing this to happen. Blalock was well aware of the credentials that Thomas needed in order to have any credibility. And in the film Blalock's wife called this fact to his attention. Thomas was also aware that he was being short-changed. Thomas was in a position where he had to think about being able to provide for his family. But as long as they had been struggling on the poor salary that was he was being paid to work as a research assistant, he could have finished medical school twice. Thomas didn't realize that he was in a position of power. Blalock believed that he couldn't do his valuable work without Thomas. Thomas could have totally made his participation in the study contingent on the funding of his studies.\n\n3. In the event that he decided that he didn't want to work on Blalock's study, he would still have a professional degree to fall back on. And I believe that Thomas realized that. If he decided to leave the study he would have to work as a janitor or handyman, and he had specialized training as a surgeon. It would have been humiliating. And that fact gave Blalock the advantage, because even though Thomas wasn't a physician, he still had the prestige of being a part of history.

"In full, JOSÉ PROTACIO RIZAL MERCADO Y ALONSO REALONDA (born 19 June 1861, Calamba, Philippines- died 30 December 1896, Manila, Philippines), patriot, physician and man of letters whose life and literary works were an inspiration to the Philippine nationalist movement.\nRizal was the son of a prosperous landowner and sugar planter of Chinese-Filipino descent on the island of Luzon. His mother, Teodora Alonso, one of the most highly educated women in the Philippines at that time, exerted a powerful influence on his intellectual development.\n\nHe was educated at the Ateneo de Manila and the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. In 1882, he went to study medicine and liberal arts at the University of Madrid. A brilliant student, he soon became the leader of the small community of Filipino students in Spain and committed himself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he never advocated Philippine independence. The chief enemy of reform, in his eyes, was not Spain, which was going through a profound revolution, but the Franciscan, Augustinian and Dominican friars who held the country in political and economic paralysis.\n\nRizal continued his medical studies in Paris and Heidelberg. In 1886, he published his first novel in Spanish, Noli Me Tangere, a passionate exposure of the evils of the friars rule, comparable in its effect to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. A sequel, El Filibusterismo, 1891, established his reputation as the leading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He annotated an edition in 1890 on Antonio Morga's Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, which showed that the native people of the Philippines had a long history before the coming of the Spaniards.\n\nHe became the leader of the Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to its newspaper, La Solidaridad, published in Barcelona. Rizal's political program, as expressed in the newspaper, included integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representation in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of the Spanish friars by the Filipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinos and Spaniards before the law.\n\nAgainst the advice of his parents and friends, Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892. He found a nonviolent reform society, La Liga Filipina, in Manila, and was deported to Dapitan, in northwest Mindanao, an island south of the Philippines. He remained in exile for four years, doing scientific research and founding a school and hospital. In 1896, the Katipunan, a nationalist secret society, launched a revolt against Spain. Although he had no connections with that organization or any part in the insurrection, Rizal was arrested and tried for sedition by the military. Found guilty, he wa publicly executed by a firing squad in Manila. His martyrdom convinced Filipinos that there was no alternative to independence from Spain. On the eve of his execution, while confined in Fort Santiago, Rizal wrote Mi Ultimo Adios (""My Last Farewell""), a masterpiece of 19th-century Spanish verse."

There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!"

"There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. Nicodemus is named three times by John, and not elsewhere; here, in chapter 7:50, where he protests against condemning Jesus unheard, and in chapter 19:39, where he aids Joseph of Arimathæa, in the burial of Jesus. There are untrustworthy traditions about him and an allusion in the Jewish Talmud to a Nicodemus who lived about this time, but it may have been another man. Two facts are here stated: (1) That he was a Pharisee of the powerful, self-righteous sect which laid such stress on ceremonial observances and Jewish birth; and (2) That he was a ruler, a member of the Sanhedrim, the congress of seventy persons who held the chief authority in Israel. The allusion to him in verse 10 as a ""teacher in Israel,"" would imply that he was one of the prominent doctors of the law.\n\nHerodias was the sister-in-law of the Herod who arrested John the Baptist.  She was the wife of Herod's brother Philip."
It varies from chapter to chapter, greek organization to greek organization, fraternity to sorority, etc.  Greek organizations no longer condone/allow hazing like one would think of, due to insurance rates and legal ramifications, among other things, I assume.  You will have to go through some sort of a pledgeship if you are joining a greek organization worth joining.  You may have to help clean the house, work on the homecoming float, DD for actives, go to formalized study hours, etc.  It is good stuff though.  You learn about your fraternities history; you get to know your pledge brothers, the actives, sorority girls, etc.  \n\nJoining a fraternity does so much for you in college, and even more for you beyond your college experience.  Fraternities provide a large brotherhood of people that care for you, guide you, support you and help you through your college years and beyond.  The Fraternity provides you with a group of people that are like you, that have the same goals as you, share the same struggles as you, have the same classes as you and want to be successful like you.  Whenever you surround yourself with people that share the same drive for success and goals as you do, it is much easier to succeed.  \n\nI am still in daily/weekly contact with a large network of my fraternity brothers.  We are all college grads; we have successful careers; work in a variety of different industries; make good money, and sincerely care about each others success.  In some way, almost all of us are in our current career positions due to our fraternity ties.  My last promotion was offered to me by a guy that wasn't in my fraternity, didn't go to my college, etc....however, whenever he read my fraternal accomplishments on my resume, he understood what I did.  He understood that I was a leader of men.  He did the exact same things, lived through the same thing, shared the same joys and tragedies...we moved the interview to happy hour after the formal part was over and we shared stories...no one even had a chance at my job after that.  I was in.  We shared a brotherhood experience.  I could go on and on.\n\nMany people think fraternities are all about parties and girls.  Well, that is part of it.  I mean, get any group of 18-22 year old guys together and what do you think they are all about?  It is normal.  There is so much more to it than that though....that is just the fun part!  Fraternities put you in a better position to be successful, to meet more people, meet more girls, get jobs, be involved in activities, sports and etc.\n\nIt is not for everyone I guess, but I wouldn't do it any other way.
I'm from the Atlanta area and went to school in New York City, so I might be able to help a little. First off, I don't like Atlanta much at all. You can't really walk around, there's way too much traffic, and it's miserable in the summer.\n\nHowever, going to school here might be different because there is a lot of opportunity to do athletic-type activities, if you are so inclined, and you'll make friends quickly. The food is excellent in Atlanta. All kinds, all kinds of price ranges, all kinds of decor. I actually like eating in Atlanta more than I did in New York. While the arts scene is definitely not up to New York's standards, the acting community here is really good, so the theatrical productions, while sparse, are usually fun to see. Movies open here a week or two later than New York (or not at all). There are two art film houses (kind of) and the museum has a film schedule. The music scene is kind of onverwhelming at first, but try as many places as you can and you'll figure it out. One thing Atlanta has that may sound a little juvenile but I love it is the Center for Puppetry Arts (puppet shows). Don't laugh, just try it. The mountains are less than two hours away; Charleston is a good romantic weekend trip...\n\nAs for walking around, there is Piedmont Park and local festivals, but it's really rather bleak in that regard. If you live in Roswell or Alpharetta (north side) there are many parks there.\n\nInside Atlanta, there is a tiny hippie strip called Little Five Points that is kind of like St. Marks. Close by is the Highlands which is kind of nice. East Atlanta is close by and is kind of the indie-rock part of town, I guess. All of these areas you can walk places and won't need to drive everywhere.\n\nJakes Ice Cream!\n\nI'm not a clubbing person, so I'm no help there. I don't like Buckhead much at all.\n\nCheck out Creative Loafing... (web site below)\n\nGood luck, and an early welcome to Georgia!
one company hires you to advertise their comapny on another companies website ....\n\nanswers both questions i think
they're pretty similar actually...farm tenancy is a person who lives on farm land owned by a landlord. The rights the tenant has over the land, and the form of payment, varies across different systems. In some systems, he could be evicted at whim (tenancy at will); in others, he signs a contract for a fixed number of years (tenancy for years or indenture).\n\nSharecropping is actually a form of tenant farming.  The people who are sharecroppers do not own any of the land they have...they basically grow items on the land and whatever profit they make off of it they give about 1/3 of it back to the owner.  This practice was mostly done after the civil war when plantation owners figured this would be a good practice to make a profit and keep their land tended to without losing their help.  \n\nBut anyway, I hope this little bit helps...

I was a youth leader a few years ago, and I know that if you make the material relevant, they will be interested.\n\nDespite what one of the answerers says, kids DO want to learn, they are just tired of having to memorize facts and dates and doing busy-work.  They've been doing it for YEARS, you know?\n\nWe need passionate high school teachers--passionate about their subjects, and passionate about their students.\n\nI know a teacher who has his students do a family tree--isn't that great?!  They learn something about their OWN heritage and history, and then fit it into a larger context.\n\nAnd use music. Nothing grabs their attention like it--and I know you can use today's music--either juxtaposed or complementarily.\n\nHigh schoolers are just like us--if we can connect something we KNOW to what we have to learn, we pick it up much more easily.\n\nWhat's going on right now that they care about? I know my son--a senior next year--is disgusted with the state of affairs--the environment, people driving gas-hogs, politicians lying.  \n\nHow exciting for you!  And what a gift to be able to touch young lives in a way that will impact them for years to come.\n\nGood luck!

"A pave' diamond (pa-vay) is just basically tiny diamonds in clusters or group. Like in a ring, all those group of tiny diamonds ""stuck"" together right next to each other on the band is a pave' style. Usually an engagement ring has this big diamond in the middle. Then it has these tiny diamonds on the ring-band (either covering part of the band or all-over it) as accent...that is pave. Best example would be the eternity ring."

James Lenox (19 August 1800 - 17 February 1880) was an American bibliophile and philanthropist, born in New York City. Lenox was a founder of the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. His collection of paintings and books eventually became known as the Lenox Library and later became part of the New York Public Library in 1895. In 1913, the collection was moved to the central library. The Frick Collection stands on the library's former Fifth Avenue site.\nLenox Avenue runs north-south through Harlem in Upper Manhattan. Originally a part of Sixth Avenue, which was renamed in 1887 for James Lenox. In 1987, it was co-named Malcolm X Boulevard (both names are officially recognized).

Library can help you read books you can`t afford to buy. For the impact, it depends on where and how good the library is. In Indonesia there are too many old books that I always sneeze when read a book.
You can try managing your time by prioritizing by importance and/or deadline.  You can start attending to requirements that are due at an earlier date.  It also helps if you regularly study as compared to studying (or craming) for a test the night before, because you are always prepared.  It will also be a good idea to start right away when projects are given, as also not to cram.  You'll feel less stressed.\n\nThere is no best time management for everyone.  Each one has his own time management technique, so try and find your own style that works best for you.\n\nI hope this helps!  Good luck!

"We get this question periodically. Here's the answer:\n\nPigeons are altricial birds, i.e., they stay in the nest until they can fly. Pigeon young are hatched at 18 days. They stay in the nest till they are about 30-35 days old. When they fly for the first time, you can often see them in flocks among the adults if you know what to look for. Young pigeons have little if any iridescence on the neck. They still often squeal when they chase their parents or other adult trying to con them into feeding them. Their feathers are a bit duller than the adults and their tail feathers often have a slight point to them - where the down was attached. \n\nPigeon young almost double their weight each day in the nest and pigeon parents feed them well. In fact, for about the first ten days, they actually feed them a ""crop milk"". It's not really milk as we think of in mammals -- it looks more like a cottage cheese they produce - but it is a high energy food and the youngsters (squeakers) grow fast and well on it. About 7-10 days into the nest period after hatch, the adults begin to add grain, seeds, whatever, to the food that they are giving the youngsters.\n\nThere are a lot of young pigeons out there at certain times of year and part of the fun of looking at a flock is to recognize which are young and which are adults.\n\nIf you want to find out more, you might want to also check a few sites like:"

Corporate communications can encompass a number of functions, depending on the company. Usually, it includes media relations and employee communications.

But in general, when you're looking for a distance learning degree, try to find a program at a school that has a good reputation for their ""brick and mortar"" campus. So, because you're looking for that particular major, I'd suggest that you actually start by doing a search for traditional colleges that offer that major. Then check each website and call their admissions offices to see if they offer it online. \n\nGood luck."

"Writing a Case Study \n\nThere are two types of case studies: factual ones depicting real organizations, people, and situations and fictional ones that, although usually based loosely on actual people and events, do not use real organization's or people's names. The advantages of factual case studies are that they can provide a wealth of detail, give credibility to situations and problems, and, most important, provide real outcomes. Actual results give those who analyze a case real-world solutions: How did the organization or manager solve the problems? Did the solutions work? \n\nFactual cases furnish concrete, not theoretical, solutions. When discussing factual cases, analysts tend to focus on the accuracy of the details rather than on the appropriateness of the solutions. Factual cases tend to become outdated as organizations, strategies, problems, and people change over time. Also, if a factual case portrays real organizations or people in a negative way, questions of taste, fairness, and even libel can arise. When writing a factual case stay with the facts, limit discussion to only those management topics that are constructive in the case.\n\nThe most effective use of factual cases are for describing current organizational problems, then analyzing and attempting to solve the problems using a consultative approach. Fictional cases have the drawback that students can never know if a solution worked or not. \n\nThere are several ways to present a case history. A case history may include: \n\nstate the problem, \nhistory/background of the facts, \nanalysis of the problem, and \nrecommendation \nconclusion - if needed\nSometimes one or more of these categories may be sub-divided. Consider the ""analysis"" section. A problem may be analyzed in terms of the ""internal"" or ""external"" environment. For example the local government may have a specific problem with safety issues. This issue could be the result of poor training, insufficient number of employees, or poor morale. Such problems would be considered internal problems. Therefore, an ""external"" problem may be an issue that is located outside of the locale.\n\nCase studies do not have to be restricted to problems and how-not-to situations; they can show solutions and how-to situations also. A case study can address several problems and show what was done right in solving them. Often the best teaching cases are those that contain both appropriate and inappropriate problem solutions. By using this technique, writers do not signal to readers that all the solutions are either right or wrong--case analysts have to figure it out for themselves. \n\nState the Problem - in two or three sentences. \n\nHistory/Background of Facts - Summarize the facts in the case.\n\nAnalysis of the Problem - Analysis often is the most difficult section of a case history to write. Sometimes there is a fine line between summary and analysis and/or analysis and recommendation. In your analysis you may discuss the causes of the problem as well as the impact of the problem. This section of your case history is important because you are evaluating the problem(s) so that you can make a recommendation or present a plan to correct the problems. Avoid words such as ""must,"" ""should,"" ""need to."" Do not make recommendations in this section.\n\nRefer to your summary and ask yourself some basic questions, for example. \n\nWhat were the conditions which allowed the problem to develop? In our case, the problem is…""what is the overall status of the management of environmental matters in urban governments?"" \nWhy did the soil get in its present state - contaminated? \nWho was responsible for the dumping? \nWho was affected by the contaminated soil? \nWhat are the short and long range effects of the contaminated soil? \n \n\nRecommendations - In this section you provide direction. Based on the information you have gathered and your ana"

Gazeous hydrocarbons, in particular propane, butane and their mixtures are widely used as an alternative to fuel oil heating purposes. The storage and transportation of such gases, especially LPG (abbreviation of Liquefied Petroleum Gas), imposes stringent technical requirements. The material must be carefully selected, continual quality checks must be performed during manufacturing and comprehensive tests must be performed on completed tanks. \n\nThe transport of LPG from the production places to the consumption places is done either by sea or by land transportation.\nThe sea transportation means are called butaners or propaners.\nAmong the land transportation means, we can find :\n\nLPG pipelines \nLPG rail tankers \nLPG road tankers \nLPG delivery trucks (bulk and cylinders) \nIn Europe, in order to increase the competitivity of LPG, the supply costs have been decreased by rationalizing transport and in particular increasing the number of sea terminals.\n\n\n\nLPG is typically transported by dedicated vessels suitable for carrying pressurised, semi-pressurised or refrigerated LPG.\n\nThe pressurised (18-bar, ambient temperatures) or semi-pressurised (5-8 bar, -10 to -20 degrees Celsius) LPG ships carry 3 – 10,000 m3 or 10 - 30,000 m3 respectively. \n\nLarger volumes require refrigerated transport solutions (ambient pressure, but at temperatures as low as -43 degrees Celsius for 100% Propane). Fully refrigerated vessels typically have cargo volumes ranging from 35,000 m3 up to 100,000 m3. Evaluating the markets for LPG transportation world-wide, a trend is developing towards the refrigerated transport of LPG in large volumes. The offshore terminal solution is suitable for all three types of transfer. The loading / un-loading (turnaround) cycle, including the mooring and departure procedures, can usually be achieved in about a day.

"Go to the library at a major university and ask to see an index that compiles articles on social issues like feminism.  (You may have used the ""Reader's Guide"" in high school.  For God's sake, don't use it for a college paper.)  Look up feminism or equal rights in the index and see what scholars are discussing.  You can even find a particular scholar's paper and use it as a source and/or check out his/her works cited list to get an idea for sources.  \n\nAnother suggestion, write about the feminist backlash.  You might discuss what the causes are for the backlash or what the solutions might be in order to bring an end to the backlash.\n\nGood luck!"

There's a slight difference in preparation depending on whether you will be interviewing at a religiously-affiliated institution, or a non-religiously-affiliated institution. \n\nIn both cases, have questions for the faculty.  Here are some appropriate ones:\nDo most students complete the program?\nOf those that do, what do they do afterwards?  (In other words, what is this program's placement rate?  What are current graduates of the program doing?  Do they teach?  Where?)\nIs there strong mentoring of students by the faculty in the program?\nAre there language requirements?  How are these fulfilled?\nIs the dissertation requirement integrated into the program? How?\nAre most students who are accepted into the program supported? Does this support include full tuition remission? Is there a stipend? \nAre stipends only given to teaching or research assistants?\nIs there a separate method to apply for an assistantship or a fellowship?\nCan non-funded students serve as teaching or research assistants?\n\nIf you are interviewing at a religiously-affiliated institution, you may also have to answer some questions regarding your own religious position or agenda.\n\nIn any PhD program interview, be prepared to talk about your research interests, your theoretical/methodological orientation, and your preparation up to this point (languages, Master's thesis, archaeological fieldwork, etc.).  \n\nAlso, it is extremely desirable for you to be knowledgeable about the faculty's respective areas of specialization.  Be familiar with each faculty member's current work.  If you don't have time to read it all before your interview, at least get familiar with the specific research interests of each person.  (You probably know some of this already, since you applied to the program, and hope to have one or two of these people as mentors in your field of specialization.)\n\nBottom line:  Look at the interview as an opportunity for a good, productive conversation between you and the faculty.  You should see the interview as a place in which to present yourself in the best possible light, but also as a place in which to evaluate the program and its faculty, just as they are evaluating you.\n\nBest wishes!

"try harder for the scholarships and look for small ones.\n\nThere are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nMany people make the mistake of looking for one big scholarship amount, and the fact is that everyone is applying for the big awards.  You have a better chance at smaller awards and many awards are not based on academics or sports or major or anything else too specific.  You have to research.  \n\nStay away from student loans as much as you can.  They really undermine your future when you get out.  It took me 7 years to pay back $10,000 in student loans and sometimes my payments were over $400 a month.  When you add rent, food, living expenses to that, it becomes almost impossible to live a decent lifestyle as a new graduate earning entry level wages.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!"

a hiccough (or hic-cup) occurs when:\n\nWhile many cases develop spontaneously, hiccups are known to develop often in specific situations, such as eating too quickly, taking a cold drink while eating a hot meal, eating very hot or spicy food, laughing vigorously or coughing, or drinking an excess of an alcoholic beverage. Hiccups may be caused by pressure to the phrenic nerve by other anatomical structures, or rarely by tumors.

"aaahhh, now you know why i prefer ""marine hours"".  Noon, i.e. 12:00 on the dot is am, but one second after that is pm.  Similarly, midnight is 12:00 pm, but one second after is am.  I always find this extremely confusing because rather than thinking of the times as points on a clock, i tend to think more in terms of english grammar, where 12 is the subject, or main noun, if you will, and the minutes after are merely an adjective modifying the noun.  In this vein, it is am all the way up to 12:59:59 and switches to pm at 1:00 in the afternoon (and, of course, the reverse at midnight), which, of course, is exactly wrong.\n\nOh how i dearly wish the whole planet would kick the damnable am/pm habit and adopt marine hours.  12 is just 12, after which comes 13 and so forth until you get to 23:59:59, then you start all over again at 0."

You want a different e-mail account, so I suggest just make a new one, and if it states you already have an with them and you cant have another, see if you could delete it or change it.

French composer, Marimba player, Career Designing Professor \n\nIn parallel to his career as a professional musician (see awards and activities), Francois Du Bois has a long experience in the field of education, that he has started at the conservatory since he was 17. He has already published 3 books regarding the learning of the marimba, his specialty. \n\nHe arrived to Japan in 1998, and was invited by Keio University SFC campus, in the Faculty of Political Science. \n\nIn 2002, he creates a course of career management (for course details see here) at the International Center of Keio University, inviting Mr. Carlos Ghosn, President of Nissan, Mr. Daryl E. Green, President of Vodafone, Ms. Yukako Uchinaga, VP of IBM Japan and others, where the guests explain their personal career management to give hints to the young generations. \n\nFrançois currently offers a workshop of career designing at the Academy Hills, inside the highest tower in Tokyo, Roppongi Hills. This highly successful workshop is offered for the working generations. \n\nThe success of this workshop is probably due to the nature of the organizer, who is a musician and a professor at the same time, a very unique personality. \n\nBesides that, François has played in the Oscar winning movies, Lost in Translation by Sofia Coppola as actor. \n\nAs a specialist of Asian music, he has been responsible of the series “Asia” inside the magazine Yomiuri Weekly (200,000 copies) for 2years, introducing varieties of music, musicians, instruments, or events, giving opinions through his original point of view. He keeps contributing to the magazine with news articles. \nHe is the member of the People of Society of Literature of France.

"The ""Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?"" joke stems from a 1950s game show; it was supposed to be an easy question, but the contestants thought it was a trap and got it wrong.

Penguins use oil to stop feathers from becoming waterlogged, and thus losing heat at a much faster rate. The feet and underfeet are generously supplied with the heat trapping under feathers. Ther are also fat deposits that store heat, there. These feathers are short, very fine and multi-multi branched which traps an enormous amount of air that heated and forms insulation. keeping in body heat. Blood is resricted somewhat to external appendages like feet, although not stopped comepletely. The birds have a countercurrent heat exchange system that has ascending and descending blood vessels side by side. The heart-pumped descending oxygenated blood is cooled by adjacent rising, colder returning blood. That way the blood in the legs and feet are cooler and lose less heat to the environment than core temperature blood.\nMany penguin species migrate northward during the Antarctic winter, to warmer seas and Islands. (e.g. the Falklands etc.). One Penguin species  migrates up as far north as the coast of South Africa, another to the Galapagos Islands.\nBut the Emperor penguin, endures the Antarctic winter considerably inland to incubate their eggs, which they place between the tops of their feet and their fat bellies which completely covers the egg. It is the largest penguin species and the male and female take turns incubating and fishing.

Basic answer - all warm-blooded animals must expend some energy to maintain their bodies at an adequate temperature and avoid hypothermia. Now, the heat capacity of an animal is proportional to its volume, but the rate at which it loses heat to its environment is proportional to the surface area. The practical consequence is that the bigger the ratio between volume and surface area, the longer it takes the animal to lose significant amounts of heat and the less energy it has to expend on keeping warm - which in turn means, that the animal can afford to have a less active metabolism and eat less food in proportion to its body weight. Now, volume increases as the cube of the linear dimension, but surface area only increases with the square of the linear dimension, which means that large animals have a bigger volume to surface area ratio and thus tend to have less active metabolisms than smaller animals. n.b. that this only applies to warm-blooded animals. Cold-blooded animals, because they do not try to maintain constant body temperature, tend to be minimally affected by this principle.

Living abroad is a great opportunity that need to be considered carefully. Fear of loosing your friends should not stop you - because any friend lost for an absence of a year is not a friend worth keeping. They could even use the opportunity and visit you!\n\nBefore accepting an au-pair contract though, make sure you understand in full, and agree to, what it means. It is actual work - housecleaning and working with children, and it is at times harder that you can think. If the mom works out of the house, you may also feel alone, and miss your friends all that much more. \nMake sure your situation will be legal! you need a work permit, and a legit health insurance - problems are fast to creep up, and you don't want to find yourself without a place to go, and sick.\nE-mail and talk to your family several times, make sure you discuss all worries you have; keep in mind not only your point of view, but also the family's. Make sure you have a fall-back option - a friend close by, or a plan of what to do - or a credit card to charge a back-home ticket if something really should go bad (it can happen)\n\nUltimately, remember that this is an employment, not an alternative family or friends. Like in all life situations, you may end uup being great friends, but first the employment experience must be a good one.

"The telescope was invented by Hans Lippershey in 1608. Galileo heard about the invention and made his own telescope in 1609. Though he was not the inventor of the telescope, I think he was the first to train it on various astronomical objects such as Jupiter, the Milky Way galaxy (which he could resolve to myriad stars) etc. He the the first to carry out astronomical observations using a telescope. He preached that the earth and the planets move around the sun, which was against the church viewpoints. For writing a book about the helio-centric theory, he was forced to recant his statement. Legend has it that after recanting, he is said to have muttered "" epur si muove"" meaning "" nevertheless it moves"" probably referring to the earth."

The Brihadisvara temple was built by the great Tamil ruler, Rajaraja Chola I of the Chola dynasty. The shikaram, an octagonal, carved cupola, itself is very large and heavy and, until recently, was thought to be carved out of a single stone. However during one of the cleaning efforts, it was found to be in two pieces. The task of carrying this huge crown to a height of 70 meters is another feat worth mentioning. In order to do this, an inclined plane of sand was built from a distance of nearly 11 kilometers. The place where this scaffold began is called the Sarap pallam.

mechanical engineering is among the most versatile.. ,I know others will argue that point.  Actually the electronics industry, as a whole, hires more MEs than EE for packaging, thermal analysis, shock and vibration, materials, etc.  MEs can go into the energy industries (power, air conditioning, nuclear, etc), automitive (cars, trucks, components, vibration systems, etc), design (not software but hardware and system design, etc), and industrial and manufacturing.\n\nI started out in biomedical engineering and switched to mechanical in my second year and have worked in the biomedical field more than any other field.

There are three basic parts of a strategy to increase tourism - develop sites people will want to visit, make it easy for them to get there and let them know about it.\n\nSo first figure out what is unique and special about your area. Are there historic sites that are (or could be) preserved? Are there special events that occur already or could be developed? Are there local or national parks or other interesting sites that could be developed for this purpose? \n\nMake sure there are overnight accommodations, dining options and shopping opportunities. This is where much of the tourist budget is spent. \n\nThen you need to make it easy to get to your location. Work with the airlines and other potential travel partners to develop travel packages that will attract the types of individuals, families, corporate groups, etc. that you want to target.\n\nThen get the word out via a marketing campaign using email, print media and other vehicles to spread your message to the tourists you are interested in. Use free listings like with AAA or other travel services to stretch your budget.\n\nGood luck.

"(I have not read Peter Carey's ""The Rose""...)\n\nYour story is very good, and I hope I’m not too late to have a look at it.  (I thought there might be others who would want to have a go at editing it before me!)\n\nI hope I have got the gist of it correctly; do you actually mean “glasshouse”, or would “greenhouse” be better all the way through?  In the UK we would normally use “greenhouse”.\n\nWell, here is how I would say it – just a few minor corrections:\n\nThe story is about how a former Commandant of Auschwitz hid himself in an isolated mountain village, passing his days by growing a black rose, (would you put, instead, “passing his days by growing a black rose, in fear of his fate….?) and his fate of being captured by the government.  The story is set in a poor Mediterranean town twenty-five years after World War II.  The former Nazi Commandant turned into an old man who made (a helmet while living in a shabby room/home/ house?  Not clear!)  He was afraid that the locals would identify him as a demon (try “criminal”, or “war criminal”), so he lived a simple life by growing roses.  As the town was (I would keep the tenses consistent) rural, aliens (or, more colloquially, “newcomers”?) were not very welcome, even though the old man (had?) lived there for twenty-five years.  In the story, there are contradictions between repentance and forgiveness; fear and hope; awe and fortune.\n\nThe settings of the story are rather vague.\n\nThe reader can only infer that the place is an isolated mountain village in which the locals spoke Spanish very badly.  It seems that the place is somewhere in the Mediterranean.  There are only about two sentences implying where it is: “I have looked for the village in an atlas and cannot find it”; “He spoke Spanish very badly”.  Such a vague description of place creates an atmosphere of loneliness that reflects the old man’s life.\n\nThe time is precise in detail but vague as a whole.  The author does not imply the exact time when the old man arrived in the town, but just says: “after twenty-five years”.  This shows that the longer the old man stayed there, the more horrified he felt.  In the story, the clock the old man sent to the school as a gift stopped, and “its hands were still showing eighteen minutes past seven when two more foreigners arrived in the village fifteen years afterwards”.  The description of the precise time shows the destiny of the old man while the author does not give the exact time.  The time is just a symbol.\n\nSymbolization is the most important feature of the story.\n\nThe old man planted roses and nurtured a tremendously large, black rose.  Roses are ancient symbols of love and beauty.  In the story, the black rose has its own special symbolic meaning, analysing it by its context.  First, as a true black rose is impossible to produce naturally, to grow one represents slavish devotion.  The old man put all his time and energy into growing roses in an intricately-wrought glasshouse, so that he produced a black rose twice the size of a man’s fist.  Black roses in subculture mean tragedy.  At the end of the story, the old man was captured/caught as a war criminal.  In addition, the black rose might denote shame and dishonour.  Why was the old man willing to be teased by the idle clerk?  Why did the old man look fragile and pitiful?  Maybe he felt shame for what he had done before in his life.  He might have wanted to atone for his crime by growing roses.  Furthermore, the black rose might symbolize the dark side of a person.  The old man knew that being captured was his destiny, no matter how he concealed his past, but the instinct of survival motivated him to take the chance.  Finally, the black rose in the story has an implication of hope of life.  The black rose was left while the old man was taken away, and its descendants were carefully nurtured by the locals.  They, in turn, show complex feelings towa"
It is estimated that there are now only around 15,000 jaguars left in the wild and conservation is centring on the establishment of protected ‘National Park’ areas which may serve to reduce the decline of the jaguars natural habitat. In Belize, the government, aided by the WWF, have set aside 150 square miles of rain forest in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Preserve, which currently provides a protected environment for around 200 jaguars, the largest concentration of the wild cats species in the world. The WWF are also providing aid to protect some of the remaining rain forests areas of South America, which provide a refuge for the majority of the remaining jaguar population\n\n\nWish you the best and I hope that this is helpful to you and your assignment!
"i went there!!!  it's okay.  good idea to take your pre-req's there.  it's cheaper.  and the credits transfer.  (why would you pay over 2000 to learn english 151, when you can pay around 200 to learn the same thing!!!)  besides, you're degree (if you plan to go to a university) will have the name of that university on it.  so don't worry about some of the smart remarks you get from people who think ""community college is stupid"".  it's the smart way to save money, if you have half a brain to figure that out.  lol"

That's the part where the new nail is growing- underneath the existing nail.  It is white, because it is not laying against the skin, as the rest of the nail is.  The skin has blood vessels under it, which tint the skin pink, which is why that part of the nail is pink.  If you notice, the end of the nail is white, too, because that is no longer laying on skin.

What does that have to do with homeschooling? It was in 2005.
The 23 special wards that make up what is considered Tokyo proper have a population (1997) of 7,830,323 . Tokyo Metropolis extends to the west of the central city and has a population of 11,680,490 (1999). Most of the difference in population is concentrated in the Tama district, which is on the western border of Tokyo. The western reaches of the Tama district and the islands are lightly populated. The population of Tokyo Metropolis peaked in 1987 at about 11,917,000. There has been a decline since then, particularly in the central wards where high land costs and expansion of commercial centers have reduced residential land. Suburban areas in the Tama district and in neighboring prefectures (Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saltarea) have grown rapidly. The Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area, defined as Tokyo Metropolis plus the urbanized portions of three adjacent prefectures, now totals more than 27 million inhabitants; it is the largest urban area in the world. Crowding is a serious problem, particularly in the 23 wards and close suburbs. In Tokyo Metropolis the population density is 5443 persons per sq km (14,097 per sq mi), while in the 23 wards the density is 13,000 persons per sq km (33,670 per sq mi). By contrast, the average density for Japan as whole, itself a crowded country in comparison to other countries, is 328 persons per sq km (850 per sq mi). Problems that relate to crowding include traffic congestion, high land prices and rents, air and noise pollution, lack of open space and greenery, and blocked access to direct sunlight in areas of high-rise construction.

"yes, when bogart's movie characters would smoke a cigarette, they would often let it hang on their lips for a long time, not really smoking it, but it would burn up just the same and, in a sense, be wasted.  the term was originally applied to toking (smoking a marijuana cigarette) as in ""don't bogart that joint"" meaning don't waste it, if you're not going to smoke it, give it to me so i can have some, instead of just letting it burn up.  i haven't heard it applied to pizza, but the same principle applies, don't hog the whole pizza and let it get cold, pass it to me so i can have some while it's still hot"
I would recommend London. It is the capital city of England, and it is well known all over the world.\n\nI went to Goldsmiths College, University of London. It has a great atmosphere and whole range of arts subjects to choose from. The actual area of the uni is not the most salubrious - but has the advantage of cheaper accommodation. It is about 15 minutes or less by train to London Bridge and Charing Cross. Central London)\n\nThe are other universities which are in the city and might suit you better if money is not a problem and you like to be close to all the galleries and nightlife.\n\nManchester University also has a good name for English Lit. Oxford and Cambridge are the cream. All university cities are good for cultural and night life - but London gets my vote.\n\nGood luck!

In addition to the obvious benefits of academics and eventually a diploma, going to school broadens the perspective, exposes the child to a variety of people and opinions, teaches the child to get along and cope with all kinds of people and situations, develops communication skills and social skills, and teaches skills such as responsibility, problem solving, and punctuality for the world of work.   It helps the individual develop tolerance, compassion and understanding by learning about others and their world.
If more people stand on the upper deck then on the lower deck, there is a risk of the bus toppling over. The reason is that when there are more people standing on the upper deck, the center of gravity of the bus will be raised and this will make the bus unstable and there is a chance that the bus can be toppled over when it turns or something like that....

Hello.  \nI wasn't a full IB student, I was only partial IB.  But from my experience I think you should expect a lot of reading.  And make sure to really keep up with the work because of the large amount of material covered (both in class and homework) it's really difficult to catch up if you fall behind.  Also, the work did help prepare me for college.  \n\nThe only difference between the pre-IB courses and non-IB courses at my school was that pre-IB courses just had more work.  For example, in my pre-IB chemistry class I would study with a non-IB friend (we had the same teacher) and it was exactly the same type of material being covered and same type of exams.  The only difference was that I had to do more lab write-ups and the lab write-ups were a different format than the regular chemistry section.  The next year when it was IB chemistry the same topics were covered (but we went more in depth) and new topics were covered.  The class seemed to go at a faster pace and there seemed to be more labs and we also had to do a paper (for the environmental section on the IB exam).\n  I thought the IB classes were like any of my other classes in the sense that there were ups (where they seemed really easy) and downs.  There were times when I wanted to just drop out of the classes and I know for the full IB students it was especially worse but in the end it's worth it.  It might seem like it's something that's difficult and beyond doing but it's really not and you'll see that you really could do it.  The IB classes really pushed me and helped prepare me for college.  For example the IB chemistry course was just like the general chemistry courses covered at my college (I had to take the courses since the college I attend doesn't accept IB credit...something I should have really looked into before selecting the college) and the college math course I had to take was similar to the IB math course at my high school.  Also, the amount of reading we had for the IB classes helped prepare me for the reading that has been necessary in some of my college courses.  Since I'm used to the amount of reading it doesn't bother me that much whereas some of the other students in my class complain and aren't able to do the finish readings that have been assigned.  \n\nI would tell you not to be terrified/worried about the difficulty of the program, especially since it's the first year at your school and so it's going to be new for everybody.  Also, as for the IB exams that we had to take at the end of our last year (you do have a while before you even have to think about these) we had looked over copies of the past exams.  Our teachers would give us the exam as if it was a real exam in the class and then after taking them we would go over the answers together which allowed us to see which things we needed to go over.  I don't know how they'll do it at your school because it's new there but maybe the IB coordinator or whoever's in charge of the IB program at your school would have old copies of exams from other schools or the IBO itself or maybe they would be able to get them for you to look over but you don't have to really think about that until later.  \n   The best advice I can give, which I've already mentioned, is to just make sure to keep up with the work and stay on top of things (if you don't understand something get your teacher to explain it to you right away).  If you do this you should be fine.  The classes will really push you and when it's all done with you'll be so glad that you were able to do it and see just how much they were able to help.  \nGood Luck!

As long as you graduate and meet all the requirements in terms of number of credits and GPA, you're considered to have completed the high school curriculum and should be considered equal to any students a year older than you.  Colleges are not heavily influenced by extra-curricular activities except when it comes to scholarships.  It shouldn't affect your admission to the school.  It could be a negative point against you if you have only three years of an activity instead of four, but you can compensate for that by looking for other volunteer activities, or taking on positions of responsibility (be the UN Secretary-General instead of the representative from Lesotho... or whatever).

"This follow-up appeared the next day, Sept. 13, 1986. \n\nDOGTOWN TALES: \n\nSeems as if we'll never know for sure how our Dogtown got its name, but we certainly do have some good stories about its origin; it could be there's a goodly portion of truth in them all. Yesterday we covered the dog eaters from the World's Fair, but today we'll go back before the fair, to 1876. That's when, according to the 1937 History of Cheltenham and St. James Parish penned by the Rev. P.J. O'Connor, the area got its name ""from squatters who built shacks in the neighborhood of Graham and West Park after they were evicted from Forest Park."" And that's the extent of what this extensive volume on the area had to say about Dogtown. But we've unearthed yet another source for the name Dogtown, which goes back to the 1890s. That very believeable story will be told, possibly for the first time in print, on Monday."
My advice to you is this...you should try to apply for scholarships. There a ton out there that you can get. Hardship scholarships, scholarships for majoring in pharmacy, scholarships for living in New Jersey and a ton more. There are a lot of sites on the Internet that will show you all the different scholarships that are available to you. Actually monster.com has a scholarship site called Fastweb that will give you a list of everything that is available to you. It's a pain to fill out all the paperwork but, in the end...if you get the money...it's all worth it!

All encoding on normal computers is binary at the lowest level, but octal and hexadecimal numbers are used used for shorthand.  Each octal digit is 3 bits, and each hex digit is 4 bits (2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16).  Octal digits range from 0 to 7, and hex digits range from 0 to F (letters are used after 9).\n\nSpecial binary formats are used for signed and floating point numbers (i. e., 2's compliment form for signed numbers), but that seems beyond the scope of your question.
The question you have to ask yourself is where you want to be in 5 years versus where you are today. I have seen too many classmates with technology backgrounds focus on MBA courses that emphasize technology. The reason that someone with a technology background should pursue an MBA is to broaden their exposure to other functional areas - in other words you have aspirations to achieve more through increased responsibility and control of resources: people, process, and technology.\n\nAs you have learned through your work experience there is a system/service lifecycle that takes into account a wide variety of considerations (user requirements, cost and schedule constraints, etc.); this is synonymous with what an MBA degree will provide. Translation - It will expose you to other functional elements so that you can better understand your work environment and the decision making process within. It will also provide you with tools to assess the external environment (customers, suppliers, and partners).\n\nAs for going onine, part-time, or through executive courses I would recommend part-time or the executive education for the following reasons. First, you don't give up your current income. Second, you continue to amass experience. Three, you can immediately apply your knowledge (reinforce concepts). Four, your classmates are also working and serves as a great network for future opportunities. If you attend online you get added convenience but at a cost - you lose the classroom interaction (there is a lot to be learned from your fellow classmates in other industries).\n\nI write from actual experience: I have an undergraduate degree in information systems, 11 years of practical work experience, and I'm nearing completion of a part-time MBA program. I found that I could apply principles the day after each course and have found places to apply knowledge every day since. \n\nIf you should pursue a program make sure it is accredited by the AACSB (american) or EQUIS (european).\n\nI hope this helps.

"VOLTAIRE-""French writer, satirist, the embodiment of the 18th-century Enlightenment. Voltaire is remembered as a crusader against tyranny and bigotry. Compared to Rousseau's (1712-1778) rebelliousness and idealism, Voltaire's world view was more skeptical. His great contemporary thinker Voltaire disliked, but both of their ideas influenced deeply the French Revolution. In 1761 Voltaire wrote to Rousseau: ""One feels like crawling on all fours after reading your work."" \n""Liberty of thought is the life of the soul."" (from Essay on Epic Poetry, 1727)""\n\nROUSSEAU - ""In 1750 Rousseau won the Academy of Dijon award for his Discours sur les sciences et les arts (Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts, 1750), and in 1752 his opera Le devin du village (The Village Sage) was first performed. In his prize-winning discourse and in his Discourse on the Origin and Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind (1755; trans. 1761), he expounded the view that science, art, and social institutions have corrupted humankind and that the natural, or primitive, state is morally superior to the civilized state. The persuasive rhetoric of these writings provoked derisive comments from ""the French philosopher Voltaire, who attacked Rousseau’s views, and subsequently the two philosophers became bitter enemies.""\n\nKARL MARX - ""Marx' philosophy hinges on his view of human nature. Along with the Hegelian dialectic, Marx inherited a disdain for the notion of an underlying invariant human nature. Sometimes Marxists express their views by contrasting “nature” with “history”. Sometimes they use the phrase “existence precedes consciousness”. The point, in either case, is that who a person is, is determined by where and when he is — social context takes precedence over innate behavior; or, in other words, one of the main features of human nature is adaptability. Nevertheless, Marxian thought rests on the fundamental assumption that it is human nature to transform nature, and he calls this process of transformation ""labour "" and the capacity to transform nature labour power. For Marx, this is a natural capacity for a physical activity, but it is intimately tied to the active role of human consciousness:\n\nA spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. (Capital, Vol. I, Chap. 7, Pt. 1) \nMarx did not believe that all people worked the same way, or that how one works is entirely personal and individual. Instead, he argued that work is a social activity and that the conditions and forms under and through which people work are socially determined and change over time.\n\nMarx' analysis of history is based on his distinction between the means / forces of production, literally those things, such as land, natural resources, and technology, that are necessary for the production of material goods, and the relations of production, in other words, the social and technical relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together these comprise the mode of production; Marx observed that within any given society the mode of production changes, and that European societies had progressed from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist mode of production. In general, Marx believed that the means of production change more rapidly than the relations of production (for example, we develop a new technology, such as the Internet, and only later do we develop laws to regulate that technology). For Marx this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure is a major source of social disruption and conflict.\n\nMarx understood the ""social relations of production"" to comprise not only relations amo"

"Absolutely get a degree that will help you in the world of work.  No matter how talented you are, until you have made a reputation and begun earning in the Arts, you will require food, a place to live, clothes, travel money, etc.  Such expenses are not paid for by your ""potential"" as a great artist.  The days where a wealthy patron would support you as you honed your craft are practically gone.  Not only that, but taking courses in college on how to get your writing sellable will make a big difference.

Besides, reading great literature in college and learning what goes into it will not be lost on you.  Best of luck."
Interesting you should ask this, aliciamichelle. Over the last two weeks, I spoke with two teachers from two different levels - one from middle school, and one from high school - and each independently said that reading during the summer really helps. One said if you read a chapter before you go to sleep, before you know it, you will have finished the book. The other teacher said that it takes a lot of pressure off the students and, when they go back to school, subjects come easier and everything seems to go more smoothly. Good question.

I am starting my 4th year of Medical School at UT San Antonio in Texas.  I am lucky because Texas offers its residents the least expensive medical school in the US with tuition and fees of about 11K to 12 K per year.  Books, living expenses, etc...all add up of course, but the federal student loan program allows anyone who is willing to live frugally (my budget for living expenses on loans only is about 1500 per month and this is not difficult to do) the ability to borrow all that is necessary to pay for school and live.  You will be borrowing probably 150K over the 4 years, but you can consolidate and pay it back over long enough that it is do-able if you really want to do it.  \n\nAnother option is the military program.  Any branch of the military offers a stipend that will basically give you the same amount of money that loans do per month, pay for tuition, fees and books and in exchange you will pay back year for year to the military.  So, you will not be in any debt at all when you complete your time committment to the military.  They are recruiting strongly now and allow many things, such as older than usual or past medical histories of some things, that they would not have allowed in the past.  This is a good option if you are not comfortable with debt.\n\nAs for how difficult it is to get in my advice is this.  When I decided to apply some people laughed at me and said I would never make it because I was a fine arts major and went to a smaller, less than impressive undergraduate school, but I DID get in and if you really want to - you will too.  Check the school web sites for necessary prerequisites and time lines to apply, do some volunteer work or work as an orderly or something like that in a hospital - this will prove that you are motivated, and then take the MCAT entrance exam (I HIGHLY recommend a preparation course prior to taking this exam - they are MORE than worth the money).  Apply - if you don't get in the first try - go in person to talk with someone in the admissions department at a medical school and talk with them openly about your application.  Take their advice and re-apply.  We need good doctors.  So, if you feel the calling, don't let anything get in your way!

Hey, auntb.  My grammar students last semester thought it was hilarious that I got so excited about grammar.  I think this example is really cute, but do you think it would really help someone who didn't know how to use commas?
U have answered ur own question. U should take a break do something else then go back to study. It will be more productive.
First, I'd pay off my debts. All of them. Then I'd pay a few things several months and/or years in advance, because I'd like to avoid being another 20 grand in the hole, if you don't mind. \nThen I'd buy myself a home and a car, and shoot some cash to my parents for putting up with me & my BS for so many years.\nNext, maybe I'd seek out some of my friends who need some help.....more morally than monetary, and help them do the same things I'd just done for myself. And set up some college/trust funds for their kids.\nMaybe I could find some good organizations to donate some money & some time....like Habitat for Humanity or something. Maybe get in the school board's face around here, and tell them I'll do a little something with their budget, but in return they have to step up their curriculum & stop graduating idiots (I heard our schools are like 49th in the nation - HELLO). Maybe I'd travel the country & speak in schools about my lifestyle & where it got me (I'm a bad, bad girl).\nAnd somewhere in there I'd go do some crazy shopping & spa-type things, with a health club membership b/c I'm fat & lazy & that's gotta go. And put my own self through college to get a few degrees that might be worth something :-)

I'm not a nursing student or single mother, but a good friend of mine is both. She's currently in her second year of college and is taking care of her child by herself.  She relies on her parents for some help with childcare, and she also utilizes daycare through the hospital where she works. It's difficult for her to juggle everything, but she knows that she is building a really  good life for herself and her child. I think knowing that helps her get through. Good luck!
my sister is currently in her first year of the open uni psychology course. she is finding it very good, they have one lecture a week on an evening and the tutor helps you at any time if you don't understand. she's managing to hold down job as well, practicly stress free. the topics are very interesting, currently on criminal psychology! you do a 750word essay every month. but believe me that  its better than doing a 3000word one every 2months, like i have to at full time uni!!  you get given a book to get all your answers from, so that means it is not expensive or time consuming to do research! over all she loves it! so,go for it, you won't regret it! good luck!!!!!
Mandatory recycling, and we may mine asteroids and other planets for metals.
Of course! In fact, in the steel industry, cast iron is made into wrought iron. Several processes r useful; I personally know of the Puddling process. There cast iron is melted when impurities escape in the form of their oxides, & then it solidifies as wrought iron . This is then employed to prepare steel by the Bessemer process.

I'm going into 7th grade tto and a lot of these answers are true, but just be prepared for more homework and more pressure. Stick to you friends like glue, because they can drop so fast you don't know what hit you. I'm sorry, but girels can be really mean so stand your guard. If you see someone being left out you should try to include them. Different teachers can have different oppinions about almost everything, so don't think that the some tactics will work on everyone. Have fun. If you need adice ask someone you truly trust, perferably a family member. Stick to your family as well because no matter how bad your grades are (which I'm sure they aren't at all) or how big of a mess your room is they will always love you. I would start out (as far as classes go) by choosing the simplistics at least for the frist quarter. After that maybe one or two extra ciricular classes to keep your stress level down. Also, always keep on the good side of your teacor you might not know what will happen. As far as boys, to start out you should follow your parents advice and rules otherwise you might end up in a really bad situation. Also, do what you think is right and definitly don't do anything just to make someone cool. Follow your heart, otherwise your letting yourself down. Make sure the person your dating is someone acceptable to you, not just to your friends. If someone you truley trust tells you to stay away from your dating or trying to become friends with then you probably should, but they may not know what's best for Y-O-U. You should think about that every time you decide to go out with someone or hang out with some one. Is this best for you and your family, (because they will always be a part of your life) or your popularity, or friends. I hope you make the right choices and think about them before you make them. Good Luck, and Congrats on going into Junior High!
The only advice I can give you is be careful of people promising radical cures and charging big bucks for the cure.\n\nTry some of the dyslexia cures like writing with different colored inks on different colored paper. Red on Blue or Black on Pink seem to help. You would need to experiment. Also see if covering an eye helps.\n\nFrom what I have read your son will need to do exercises to improve his vision problems. The British link below offers on-line exercises. I suggest that you follow up with them.
If a woman proposes to you, she must love you a lot. But, it is most likely the person you proposed to is the one you love more. Take her, unless she rejects your proposal.

"yes, during the formative years i think it is a good idea; people just simply need a good a$$-whoopin sometimes, as long as it is within reason and the rules have been clearly laid out for them. a teacher i knew in 7th grade used to paddle someone once a week and i didn't see anyone reacting in any way but with respect and just plain fear. as people grow older i think the whole corporal punishment idea should be used only in certain circumstances. there is nothing like unjust ""punishment"" or retribution for actions within one's own prerogative to make you extremely pissed off and seek vengeance. if a cop ever told me to bend over and assume the position i'd either start laughing or take his fukin badge."
The difference between Montessori and traditional school system is the educational approach.  In a traditional class, the teacher uses the board most of the time.  The Montessori approach uses activities.  Lots of hands-on activities.\n\nI think this is why kids who had a Montessori education do practically well when they transfer to traditional schools.  But the common observation is their difficulty in adjusting initially to the new setting of the traditional method.
doesn't matter. Morehouse is his alma mater so why not?
Like I said before, learn how to spell.
Probably. For example, some words in the bible had multiple meanings. Generally many Christians say that Adam was given dominion over the earth. Later interpretations demonstrate that the same word that is used to give Adam power over the earth also means to tend (or protect) the earth. Thus some Christians, such as those who believe that it is their duty to protect the earth, may interpret the bible in a different way than the majority of Christians. I think that people's take on the issues of today affects how they choose to interpret the bible.

alot of issues are being picked up at the moment in football in the UK, racism and social inclusion in particular. whether we can use sport as a means to prevent crime and anti-social behavior in local communities.\n\nyou could use in the main qualitative methods (interview local police, youth sport co-ordinators, young people) to give you some depth into the issues surrounding youth crime in that area. \n\nYou could take a sample figure of number of incidents before the summer, one during the summer and one after to compare, giving you much stronger evidence to call on. as you would have both quan and qual data.\n\nhope this helps\nNick

Well, if you want blueprints, you can always go to your local municipal development services office and ask to se them.  They may charge you a few bucks for photocopies but they are essentially public record.  They require no identification or clearance to see and all you have to do is know what you are looking at.  \n\nI used to work in one of those departments.  The blueprints are used to approve construction permits.  Since construction permits are official documents approving development work, they are therefore subject to complete public scrutiny at any time.  They legally cannot prohibit you from making a copy.  \n\nWhen I issued fuel station permits, we had multiple levels of protocols for environmental impact, groundwater protection, surface water runoff, explosion prevention, hazardous materials, fire, etc...  Each of these areas were checked off and cleared by municipal authorities.  While Shell may have standards that they follow, they ultimately must get approval from the local government to build and this approval comes with conformity to either a local, state, or regional standards body.  \n\nHope this helps!

"This question is miscategorized. \n\nSpecial Education is about the education and parenting of children with special needs.\n\nThat being said...\n\nTo be a DJ in the United States, your doorway in is through practical experience. To get the practical experience, you need to try to get hired at a small station somewhere (small town or very low in the ratings in a city). You will need to apply at many stations to increase your odds of being hired. The other choice is to go to college, major in communications, and work at the college station. \n\nIf you are still in high school, take drama class and/or club, communications, technology class (you have GOT to get to know the equipment), and any video production class or club. Often, if you are in a small town, these teachers will either know people in radio, or BE people ""moonlighting"" at a local station (you won't know, neccessarily, because an on-air persona often has a different name and ""sound"" from the real person). Their word to the program director/general manager can get you in the door...but you must EARN that word... work hard in class and listen closely to what they have to teach.\n\nAs you look at these steps, keep in mind that a DJ is an entertainer, just like a musician, actor, or stand-up comedian. When you are auditioning for a station, you must show HOW you will keep your audience entertained and listening, while keeping the station's ""feel"" and ""format"" consistent. Regardless of the format you are interested in, be able to announce other kinds of music, anything from classical to rap, jazz to country.\n\n1. Create a ""demo tape."" Use the best quality equipment you can find, and tape yourself in a carpeted area to reduce ""echo."" You should make sure you're performance is strong enough to get their attention from the beginning (what is the most energetic personality you can show?). Give a short and direct introduction to a song, an in-depth introduction to a song, give the weather, read news copy (using the first, short paragraph from a newspaper article is ok for an audition), do a ""commercial"" for something, ""interview"" someone from the audience, etc. Each bit should not be longer than 30 seconds. The program director will probably not listen to all of it, but should get a feel for what you are currently able to do, how your voice sounds, etc.\n\nIf you are applying at several different stations, with different music formats, you should have a different tape for each format, to match the station style. \n\n2. Create a paper insert to go with your tape, that will keep the attention of the program director and make him/her curious enough to actually listen to your tape rather than toss it in the garbage. It should be simple and direct, show your personality (or personalities if you can do more than one), and be professional-quality.\n\n3. On your resume, given that you have no prior DJ experience, you want to show professionalism, creativity, and an understanding of both music and of how to work in front of an audience. Make sure, for references, to have respectable, working adults who can vouch for yor reliability (will you show up to work on time, do the best you can, etc.) and who know something about your knowledge of music. Once again, you want to appear both professional, and someone who stands out (in a positive way) from the crowd.\n\n4. Do NOT mail your demos. Hand-carry your demo to each station. Be well-dressed, and ensure that what you are wearing subtly reflects the format of the station (suit or dress for classical, casual Friday but with a jacket for alternative/soft, casual Friday with a Western touch for country, etc.). Ask to speak to the program director, and be prepared to WAIT for him/her in the front office. They WILL keep you waiting. If they ask you to come back, ask for an appointment. If you are stood up, ask for another one... You must show patience"

"Dude.  Mentos and Diet Coke.  Sweet.  Someone's already mentioned it, but I will be a good scientist wannabe and provide a little more information here.\n\nI think diet has more oxygen than others.  You could test a couple of different sodas to see.  It's showing a physical reaction between the nucleation sites on the candy (imperfections, etc. that allow bubbles to form) and the gas in the soda.  The gas wants to form bubbles, and a nucleation site is where it can do so.  The candy sinks to the bottom of the soda bottle, making the reaction last awhile.  All those bubbles have nowhere to go but up.  \n\nYour experiment could be to see what soda does it the most, or what candy has the most nucleation sites (for six year olds, you could call them ""bubble sites"" or something).  Have them guess why the bubbles go up.  They might be able to figure out that it is because bubbles are made of gas and gas is lighter.  Hmm.  That brings us to solid, liquid, and gas; something they might have heard about in science class if they've been in first grade.\n\nYou'll want to try it at home first (but as a good camp counselor, you already know that).  \n\nAnother avenue you could explore is ecology.  Something like which food ants will eat first.  If you flood an ant hill (be careful they aren't the biting/stinging kind of ants), you can watch them evacuate their colony and carry their larvae away in a struggle for self-preservation.  That's kind of mean, though.  I bet they'd love to play with Mentos and Diet Coke.  I'm sure you could do a wonderful job explaining to them about bubbles and getting them to hypothesize about where the bubbles come from.\n\nGood luck!"

Oxford became an established seat of learning as early as the 11th century, but the University as we know is today did not start to take shape until the 12th century. In 1167, due to a dispute with France, Henry II banned all English scholars from attending the University of Paris. Many of these exiled scholars congregated at Oxford and the University began a period of rapid development.
I've never been to college, didn't even finish high school, but I can tell you it is Personal Bias, Political Bias, Commercial (or money inspired) Bias.   \n\nThe media outlets all must have a positive profit model in order to stay in operation, this means there is quite a bit of external influence as to what is reported and what is left out, and this influence even extends to how the information which they do report is worded. \n\nIgnorance is a factor that plagues the internet and some news outlets.  It's difficult to know what factors could be influencing an anonymous person to make claims.  Their health, their experiences,  their likes and dislikes, what they intend to achieve with the claim, all have influence.\n\nProduct manufacturers, or any publicly traded company can be held financially liable if they don't do everything within the law to garner the greatest margins of profit for their business.  This encourages advertisement to be rife with misleading images, words and even subliminally suggested intentions.   Money is a huge factor that influences all advertisement claims. \n\nI have to note that each of the fields you mentioned have their own specific influencing factors, and it's difficult to generalize them across the whole lot.  For instance, a movie's claims are often motivated by the writer or directors specific intentions of how they wish to influence people with the work.  You aren't likely to see this as much in say.. news reporting.
.Dat files are Data files, usually used by one or more programs. They usually store information necessary to run/operate a program. If after dumping your cookies folder, they are still present, I would suggest running an anti virus program. If you want to know what they contain, try opening the files one at a time in either notepad or wordpad, then you can scroll through them and see what the text contains. There will likely be a good amount of gibberish, computer code that note/word pad cannot translate as written text. There really should not be anything in your cookies folder except cookie files (and sometimes media settings files). My best suggestion to you is to run a good anti virus program such as Avast! Home Edition (it's free). The link is to C|Net's download site, where you can get the free home edition fo Avast!

"Casa del ""Ouch!' ?"
This colorful term for a wild spree, especially one involving much drinking, probably originated on the frontier. In the nineteenth century the section of town where brothels and saloons were located was known as the 'red light district.' So a group of lusty cowhands out for a night 'on the town' might very well take it into their heads to make the whole town red.
Excellent. A+
"No, it bothers me, too.  I notice a lot of incorrect, mixed-up verb tenses (""had went"", etc) and it drives me nuts!  Also, people just don't get it when to use ""I"" and when to use ""me.""  Argh!\n\nI think its several factors:\n-partly a lack at home (parents don't back up the school lessons because they're too busy or too tired or just uneducated themselves and don't know that they should) so those kids just never internalize the school lessons \n-partly laziness on the part of the speaker/writer.  Everyone's in too much of a hurry to spend a fraction of a second thinking about the sounds the word makes and matching up the corresponding letters\n-partly a lack of interest in getting it right.  The media glamorizes ""ghetto"" or ""hip-hop"" style language and makes fun of proper grammar.  Who can blame kids for wanting to be cool instead of a geek?"

You're only annoyed because you're stessed.  Make sure you're eating well, sleeping enough, and getting enough time away from your studies to relax, your head should clear a bit.
The biggest problem is paying for it.  Because it is more expensive than regular school.  You can apply.  there are many organizations that do it.  But a family has to choose to take you.  Most families don't want to take in a student.  Because it costs money to feed them etc.  So even if you get in the program you might not be able to go if a family doesn't choose you.  \nYou can get in with normal grades.

Our literacy coordinator does not observe teachers teaching, that is a violation of our contract. If the TEACHER REQUESTS a literacy coach to observe they can but it must be agreed to by the teacher. Our literacy coaches basically attend meetings about literacy and best practices and present workshops.  They actually do very little to support the teachers.

"You can get financial aid, though it won't include federal grants (which are almost exclusively reserved for first-time undergraduates).\n\nTo apply, begin by filing the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid).  The fastest and most reliable way to do this is online at http://www.fafsa.ed.gov (the only official site, belonging to the Dept of Education). Your school will use your FAFSA results to determine yor eligibility for Federal Student Aid, (in your case, Stafford Loans, Perkins Loans, Work-Study, and PLUS Loans).\n\nNow, some of these awards are only intended for lower-income students. The good news is that, once you have a Bachelor's degree, you are automatically considered ""independent"" on the FAFSA and therefore aren't required to provide parent information thereon. As a result, many graduate students (particularly recent college graduates who haven't entered the working world) do qualify as ""high-need"" and are eligible for whatever need-based aid their schools may offer.\n\nEven if you are low- or no-need, know that any applicant will, at the very least, be offered an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan.  Additionally, graduate students (with high, low or even no financial need) are eligible to borrow PLUS loans up to the cost of their education.\n\nMany schools also offere grant and scholarship aid to their graduate students as well, so if you are successful in college and apply to any such school, you might fare very well. Institutional grants/awards/scholarships can be based on need, academics, or both. Be sure to ask prospective graduate schools about these types of aid (how much they offer, how you qualify, etc.)\n\nFinally, when considering graduate school, if you find that your federal and institutional aid package does not cover your costs, you can apply for a private loan or a PLUS loan. For a list of popular private loan lenders, try http://www.finaid.com/loans/privatestudentloans.phtml\n\nFinally, there is plenty of private scholarship funding that *isn't* limited to undergraduates. There are a variety of places you can seach for private scholarship funding: libraries, your former high school, your future college, clubs/associations near you, and the internet:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/scholarships/other.phtml\nhttp://www.fastweb.com\nhttp://www.srnexpress.com\nhttp://www.scholarships.com\nhttp://www.scholarships101.com\nhttp://apps.collegeboard.com/cbsearch_ss/welcome.jsp\nhttp://services.princetonreview.com/default.asp?RUN=%2Fcollege%2Ffinance%2Fscholar%2FscholInterview%2Easp&RCN=auth&RDN=7&ALD=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eprincetonreview%2Ecom\nhttp://www.collegeanswer.com/paying/content/pay_free_money.jsp\n\nPursue funding from as many legitimate sources as you can -- and don't cease your efforts once you become enrolled in college. Don't be discouraged if you are turned down from a few (or more than a few). All scholarships, including the small ones, are competitive. You do need to be wary of scholarship scams, not the least of which is the claim that that there are ""tons of unclaimed scholarships"" just floating around out there. For information on this myth (and other scams), try reading these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/scholarships/unclaimedaid.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/scholarships/protecting.phtml\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/alerts/ouchalrt.htm"
umm... i'm in physics right now also, trying to think of a great summer assignment for the class.  i would suggest something like rockets (7th and 8th graders always love rockets), or a trebuchet (catapult).  those are always fun to make, and everybody loves those projects.  so, have fun!
use the formula b*2-4ac<0 because for if all values of x is negative then the curve will pass totally under the x-axis\n\nb*2 is b to the power of 2
"Most often it would say something to the effect of ""If you approve my loan, I will start construction.""\n\nSo using your words, ""If you sanction my loan, I will start construction.""  'Will' is not needed in the first half and 'the' is not needed, in fact should not be there.  ""the construction"" would be the noun version, where you are more than likely saying construction as a verb...If you act, I will act.  However, if it's a cause and effect sentence, you want it like this...\n\nAfter(or When) you sanction my loan, then I will start construction."

1.  Learn the rules of the road first and the laws that govern them.\n2.  Take driving lessons. Study the drivers manual & owner's manual.\n3.  DRIVE WITH A QUALIFIED SUPERVISOR. Someone who has their licence and drives well.\n4.  Learn and familarize yourself with the controls of the vehicle, (lights, signals, horn, wipers)\n5.  Be aware of your surroundings at all times, whether driving forward or reverse. Check mirrors and blind spots frequently.\n6.  Practise in or around no traffic like an empty parking lot then as you get more experience, intergrate yourself into minimal then regular traffic.\n7.  Practise precision driving on a small street or empty parking lot. (steering, parallel parking etc.)\n8.  Learn speed control and emergency procedures (such as firm braking, emergency braking and maneveuring*  and skid recovery) in an large empty parking lot practise if possible.\n9.  Learn to recognize hazards on the road and avoid them.\n10. Don't be distracted or drive pre-occupied. Drive with both hands on the wheel.\n11. WATCH OUT FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLIST\n12.  Be courteous, and considerate.\n13. Use your turn signals as need. Signal in advance. Signal when you change lanes, executing a turn, pulling to or from the curb, or any deviation from your lane (such as avoid other cars or cyclist).--don't leave your signal on for 12 blocks or something, cancel it when not in use.\n14. Familiarize yourself with blindspots and changing lane procedures.\n15. Learn to time yourself when crossing through an intersection so you do not run a red light! (look for signs that the light will change)\n\nFinally don't drive like a maniac or like you own the road!\n\n*More skill is required for non ABS equiped vehicles (front wheels will lock causing loss in steering)

"Okay, let's see if we can get through this.  I'll use ""R"" instead of ""radical"" just to keep it a bit shorter\n\n[log(2R2) - 3log(R3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nStart in the top.  Notice that 2R2 = 2(2^1/2) = 2^3/2 (2 to the 3/2 power).  Likewise, R3 = 3^1/2 (3 to the 1/2 power).  So:\n\n[log(2^3/2) - 3log(3^1/2) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow remember that an exponent within a logarithm moves out to the front.  So:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2) - (3/2)(log 3) - 3] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow factor out the 3/2 from each of the terms:\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2] / [log 9 - log 4 + 4]\n\nNow let's go to the denominator.  We'll rewrite the values 9 and 4 as squares, then move the exponents out like we did before.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [log(3^2) - log(2^2) + 4]\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2 log 3 - 2 log 2 + 4]\n\nNow factor 2 out of each term in the denominator.\n\n[(3/2)(log 2 - log 3 - 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nOne more little thing to make this work.  We actually need the signs changed in the numerator, so let's factor out a -1 from each term (we should have factored out -3/2 earlier):\n\n[(-3/2)(log 3 - log 2 + 2)] / [2(log 3 - log 2 + 2)]\n\nNow notice that the top and bottom both have (log 3 - log 2 + 2).  Since this appears on both top and bottom, cancel it out.  This leaves us with:\n\n(-3/2) / 2\n-3/4\n\nI know this was long and drawn out--I hope you followed the steps."
I think life is hard cause society creates so many rules that you have to obey and stick by, the longer life goes on for the more rules there is to follow... the more rules the harder life gets... \nand if you so much as even try and push the limits on the rules of society and not follow them then the whole world seems as though its against you. Thats what makes it so difficult... you can't be yourself with out getting in trouble for it.\nSo when you try be your self life just gets hard!

"Not all scholarships are based on financial need.\n\nThere are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!"

You have two strands of activity to follow at the same time in order to start a private school.\n\nFirst strand:  Establishing the Business\n\nYou will need to write a business plan (outline of your services and fees, costs, growth plan, personnel plan, etc.) and, if you need starting capital, take it to a bank for a starter loan. Probably several banks.  If you already have your seed money, or are approved for your loan, you will need to apply to the state for a business license, register with the state and federal tax departments, and obtain approval from your local government for your business location/zoning. Your local Better Business Bureau can direct you to someone who can help you with all this.\n\n\nSecond strand: Obtaining a license to operate a private school from your state Department of Education, including obtaining accreditation.\n\nFor example, here's the information for New Mexico: http://www.ped.state.nm.us/alted/private_schools/index.html\n\n\nGood luck!

Law School will teach you the law.  Most law school students majored in something not directly related to law.  Psychology and Journalism are common examples.\n\nI am beginning Law School this fall, and I have a Broadcast News degree.\n\nThe skills you will need to score well on the LSAT and succeed in law school include excellent command of the English language, the ability to discern important information from irrelevant information, solid logical reasoning skills, and the ability to understand an issue from multiple points of view.  If you feel confident in your ability to master these skills, I think you'll do just fine in law school.

"The quality of education is hampered because teachers are now being asked to teach children the social skills that families used to promote.  Unfortunately, as a teacher, all too many times I have to deal with issues that have absolutely nothing to do with what I want to teach my kids.  Children's behavior stymies the amount and quality of teaching that goes on every day.  When reflecting upon what the major cause for this, I always go back to the lack of caring many parents have towards their child's education.  Our society has fallen into the ""it's all about me"" syndrome, and parents aren't doing their part.  Our government is now working at holding the schools accountable for what is taught and the academic success of the students attending, but until parents are held just as accountable, then our schools (especially those in the urban arenas) are going to continue to struggle.  Thanks for the question Joe."
"The Bible doesn't say that 666 is the devil's number, it says it is the ""mark of the beast"".  Many biblical scholars hypothosize that the book of Revelation wasn't actually talking about future ""end times"" type stuff, but that it was actually speaking in code about the Roman Empire, that was severely persecuting Christians during the time.  Many believe that 666 actually comes from the Hebrew way of writing people's name in code, and actually stands for the emperor Nero (or maybe Domitian, but that's a debate for people way more academic than me)"

Hi, I think that smart people do not necessarily have a better life. Since, they might be looked down on as being nerds- smarty pants. Additionally, smart people sometimes have a harder time being social since their always thinking with their brain. Also, it depends on what kind of smart you mean, a smart- quick witted person may have a good life getting along with people. However, all people have equally good lives, its what you make of it.
"Michael,\nThis is a question that many students struggle with.  How can I decide (at 18!) what I want to do with the rest of my life?  Sometimes it's a daunting question that you don't really want to answer.\n\nI was a university career counselor for 9 years, and here's my best advice:\n\n1.  Major in something you will LOVE to study.  You'll work harder at it, and be able to survive all that reading, those quizzes and tests, papers, long nights at the library, etc.\n\n2.  Visit your career services center starting your freshman year, and keep going!  Starting early, they can help with interest and personality assessments (quizzes you'll enjoy taking!), books and resources, and later, resumes, interviewing skills, connections to internships, summer jobs, mentors/networking contacts, and on-campus interviewing for jobs after you graduate.\n\n3.  If you think you have an interest in a particular path, start doing it as soon as possible!  I worked with a freshman who was determined to get a very competative fashion design internship.  She got it, and commuted from Philly to NYC three times a week - for no pay - to work for famous designer Anna Sui.  \n\n4.  Internships are key - start getting internships during your summer months as soon as you can.  Freshman sometimes get looked over, but try anyway.  If you can get three or more internships before you graduate, in fields you're interested in, you have a 60% likely chance of being offered a permanent job with that company.\n\n5.  Remember, most people don't figure out what they wanna be when they grow up until they reach age 26 or 27!  That means, even if you pick a major, pick a career, and start working, you might have 2-3 jobs before that age - and experience helps you to shape your career path.  \n\n6. Someone went there before you.  Seek out alumni contact through the career services or alumni offices, people doing the jobs you're interested in.  Contact them for short ""interviews"" where you ask questions about their job.  You'll learn a lot and make potential career-long contacts.\n\n7.  Never narrow your choices.  Start out with everything, and examine, read, try, learn, experience as many as you can.  You'll soon learn what you like and don't like.  And remember, you can always change your mind and pursue a different career later (most people change careers 6-7 times in their life).\n\n8.  Finally, remember that you'll have to get up every morning to go to this job.  If you love your job, then great, but if not, Mondays will look pretty bleak.  Success comes from pursuing your dreams and goals, things that make you happy, and creating the paths to get there.  Choosing a career because it makes money doesn't mean you'll be happy, but choosing a career you love means your heart is in it, and most likely, the money will follow too.\n\nBest of luck to you!\nMichelle Watson Gellas\n(former career counselor for Villanova University, Lehigh University, Ursinus College, and Loyola Marymount University)"

"i know its smt abt the light passing thru the water being refracted into the different colours and thats how the rainbow forms. \n\n""The rainbow's appearance is caused by dispersion of sunlight as it is refracted by (approximately spherical) raindrops. The light is first refracted as it enters the surface of the raindrop, reflected off the back of the drop, and again refracted as it leaves the drop. The overall effect is that the incoming light is reflected back over a wide range of angles, with the most intense light at an angle of about 40°–42°"""
"Study hard. Try to get some of your classmates' notes and copy everything you're missing. Spend as much time as possible with your studies, and whenever you feel you're lacking energy, just drink a cup of green ""pepper mint ""tea. It always works for me. It refreshes your mind, and is healthier than coffee. (I never drink it). However also make sure that you get enough time to sleep during the night. It's very important. And the most important: concentrate only on your study, don't daydream, or think about anything else. If you feel like you're tired, put the papers down for a few minutes, then go back and continue studying. If you concentrate by 100% on the material, you will learn and memorize everything much more effciently. Also try to pretend that you're deeply interested about what you have to learn. This helps you focus more deeply on the material. Good luck with your studies, and exams! You will do fine on it. (Just read, and pay attention only to what you read)"

Have them do more in class. Have them write a journal entries that stay in the classroom. This way you have a caliber of work that the are producing at rough draft level. Have bigger assignments with in class work, ask to see rough drafts and the work in progress. Praise the students that you know are making an honest effort and praise each improvement. Basically use the same techniques that teachers use for native language students. You do them little good if they are having others do the work or buying the work, they still have not mastered the skill they need. You may want to mention this to the class as being an important part of learning, that honesty and hard work matter, you may want to incorporate the writting into quizes and have a comprehensive exit exam as well so they know there is a reason to do the work themselves. Note cards outline rough drafts, and most people will not cheat, it is too much effort.

"Wow, you really messed up typing. Might try the space bar next time. :-D\n\nAnyway, I think you're asking, ""Find out the [longitude] of a place Q where [the] local time is 10:30 AM, while the local time of another place P, situated at 40 degrees [longitude], is 2 PM.""\n\nSo you know that the earth has 360 degrees of longitude (you go the whole way around and you cover a circle). You also know that if you go the whole way around the world, you'll pass through every time. So you have 24 hours.\n\nProportion: 24 hours = 360 degrees\n\nThe difference between the two times (10:30 AM and 2 PM) is 3 hours and 30 minutes, or 3.5 hours.\n\nProportion: 3.5 hours = ? degrees\n\n24 / 3.5 = 360 / x\nCross-multiply:\n24 * x = 3.5 * 360\nx = 3.5 * 360 / 24 = 52.5\n\nProportion: 3.5 hours = 52.5 degrees\n\nSo we know that the change in longitude is 52.5 degrees. Now the question is whether to add or subtract that from 40 degrees, which we know is the original (P). From P to Q, we're going backwards in time, which we know is westwards (look at time zones, or think about TV ads that say that a show is airing at 8 eastern, 7 central). So we need to move 52.5 degrees west. If your 40 degrees is already 40 W, then add +52.5 W to get 92.5 W. But if it's 40 E, then you need to move in the opposite direction. 40 - 52.5 = -12.5 E, or 12.5 W."

"Troop 1 of Big Spring received its first charter dated September 30, 1911 and had been registered every year until 1989 with the Boy Scouts of America.  The Troop resumed activity in 1993 and is still active today.  This Big Spring troop lays claim to being the oldest continuously chartered unit west of the Mississippi.  The first Scoutmaster in Texas to be registered with the BSA was Rev. George W. Sheafor, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Comanche, Texas in 1910, but that troop did not last more than a couple of years.  We have no way of knowing whether or not the Big Spring troop is the ""oldest continuously chartered units west of the Mississippi"" as the BSA do not keep records on such.  But they were one of the first troops to be organized and chartered in Texas. \n \nTroop 258 in Corsicana claims to be the oldest chartered with a date of 1915\nThe BSA list Troops as CONTINUOUS meaning no droppping from the national roster.\n\nIt can be noted though that there were troop started in 1910 but not registered or Chartered"
I have only ever seen 7 types cited.  Below is a description.\n\nSeeing Waste During a Kaizen Blitz\n\nProject team members may not be used to thinking in terms of waste and value in their individual work, their workgroup, and workstream so an emphasis on understanding the 7 types of waste in the project setting is essential. Examples of wastes within the work of a project team include:\n\nOverproduction due to unclear requirements from the upstream process, waiting time for information from another project team member before work can be completed, inventory of projects or project tasks that are in process, motion of switching from one multi-task activity to another, defects and rework loops, and transportation and the delays and loss of information caused by hand-offs.\n\nThen there is processing waste (which some call over-processing) Whenever you are using a crude tool to accomplish a task rather than the best available that may exist somewhere else in the workstream of the project, this is processing waste.

No and those kind of magazines shouldn't be in school or taken to school. You are at school to get your education not to look at dirty magazines. Stay in school and put your face in the school books not dirty magazines.
If it goes 450 miles in two hours, that breaks down to 225 miles in one hour- or 225 per hour.  Divide 1200 by 225 (because 225 is the per one-hour rate) and you get 5.33 hours.
"There are a couple of versions of ""trying your best.""  If that phrase means trying to study harder, trying to put more time into study, etc., you might be depriving yourself of some needed assistance.  \n\nHave you discussed your difficulties with your teachers?  Most teachers entered the profession because they truly have a desire to help students to learn.  If you take up the issue with a teacher, they or some resources they know might be able to help you with different ways to study which fit your learning style.  Don't try to improve all on your own--ask someone who might be able to help!"

Hello i also attend Penn Foster, I recieved not a perfect final grade of 100 but, my overall final grade for human relations was an 98/A. I am just starting the second English course ( after American History ).
"I took a miliatry language class in the Army (Russian) and one of our instructors told us, ""There are more teachers in Russia, teaching English, than there are students in the US, learning Russian"", not too hard to figure out, Russian isn't offered in most American High Schools. However, this is part of a larger problem.\n\nThe typical American High School (grades 9-12) offers French, German. and Spanish. Some others offer Japanese and Latin, but that's about it. Russian, Chinese, Italian, Dutch, Farsi, etc., are completely ignored.\n\nMost American High Schoolers are required to at least TAKE a foreign language course, They don't have to be proficient, but they do have to get credit, in order to graduate. By contrast, in Holland, where they speak Dutch, students are REQUIRED to learn English.\n\nAs far as how many US students go on to become language teachers, work for the government in the Diplomatic Corps, or as an interpeter for the U.N., I dont have exact figures but I would guesstimate maybe .25% (one quarter of one percent)"

So I edited you by fixing problems, but by fixing them, more problems were exposed.  I tried to lengthen and shorten you to make you sound better.  I tried to give you ""better dress"" but all I had was ""home-spun cloth"" which is to say, I tried to make you sound better but my imagination wasn't up to the task.

"One of the biggest hurdles you face is having been a teacher, oddly enough.  The corporate world in general doesn't see teaching as a happy match of personalities.  Rightly or wrongly, the corporate world sees a teacher as someone who made the decisions, as opposed to following others' decisions and, to a degree, an isolationist. It is a hard transition to make, not because of your actual talents, but in the way they preconceive you.\nCorporations like to see evidence of being a team player, following orders and working well in a hierarchy.  Fortunately, depending on the number of years you have been in school, it is not something you cannot overcome.  \nI taught for three years during the time I got a masters degree and when I moved into the corporate world, people were really afraid I was going to start telling them how to do everything. Maybe to some degree they were right.  Worse, it took me a long time to discover their preconception!!  I pass it to you in the hope that you might profit by it.\nMy advice to you is to find work in a small business in your spare time just for the experience, even if the job is somewhat beneath your skill level.  You want to have experience in being a ""team player.""  That way you can tell them you were trying it out to make sure that's what you wanted to do.\nKeep in mind that when you are making any obvious transition, people are afraid you will chuck it all and return to it.    The key question on the interview will be, ""Why do you want to change professions?""  If you say you are tired of teaching and all the hassles, they will nail you to the wall.  Tell them something about how much you enjoyed teaching in schools, but that you are ready for greater challenges that only come in climbing the corporate ladder.\nSometimes, if you manage to get one of those corporate jobs,  you have to take extra crap just to alleviate their fears.  Whatever you do, never give anyone, even in confidence, any reason to think that you ever think about going back."
"You already have the title of the poem and the author.   However,  I thought I would find out something about the poem\n\nFirstly, here are the words:\n   \nThe boy stood on the burning deck\n  Whence all but he had fled;\nThe flame that lit the battle's wreck\n  Shone round him o'er the dead. \n\nYet beautiful and bright he stood,\n  As born to rule the storm;\nA creature of heroic blood,\n  A proud, though child-like form. \n\nThe flames rolled on–he would not go\n  Without his Father's word;\nThat father, faint in death below,\n  His voice no longer heard. \n\nHe called aloud–'say, Father, say\n  If yet my task is done?'\nHe knew not that the chieftain lay\n  Unconscious of his son. \n\n'Speak, father!' once again he cried,\n  'If I may yet be gone!'\nAnd but the booming shots replied,\n  And fast the flames rolled on. \n\nUpon his brow he felt their breath,\n  And in his waving hair,\nAnd looked from that lone post of death\n  In still yet brave despair. \n\nAnd shouted but once more aloud,\n  'My father! must I stay?'\nWhile o'er him fast, through sail and shroud,\n  The wreathing fires made way. \n\nThey wrapt the ship in splendour wild,\n  They caught the flag on high,\nAnd streamed above the gallant child,\n  Like banners in the sky. \n\nThere came a burst of thunder sound–\n   The boy–oh! where was he?\nAsk of the winds that far around\n  With fragments strewed the sea!– \n\nWith mast, and helm, and pennon fair,\n  That well had borne their part–\nBut the noblest thing which perished there\n  Was that young faithful heart.\n\n********************************\nCasabianca is a poem written in the early 19th century by British poet Felicia Hemans (who was, before about 1950, generally credited as ""Mrs. Hemans"" or ""Mrs. F. D. Hemans""). The title of the poem is far, far less familiar than its first line: ""The boy stood on the burning deck"".\n\nThis poem was a staple of elementary school readers in the United States over a period of about a century spanning, roughly, the 1850s through the 1950s. So often memorized and recited as to lose any shred of meaning or emotion, it is today remembered mostly as a tag line and as a topic of parodies.\n\nThe poem opens:\n\n    The boy stood on the burning deck\n        Whence all but he had fled;\n    The flame that lit the battle's wreck\n        Shone round him o'er the dead.\n\n\nThe poem commemorates an actual incident that occurred in 1798 during the Battle of the Nile aboard the French ship L'Orient. The young son Giocante (his age is variously given as ten, twelve and thirteen) of commander Louis de Casabianca remained at his post and perished when the flames caused the magazine to explode.\n\nIn Hemans' and other tellings of the story, young Casabianca refuses to desert his post without orders from his father. (It is sometimes said, rather improbably, that he heroically set fire to the magazine to prevent the ship's capture by the British.) It is not clear how any details of the incident are known beyond the bare fact of the boy's death. Hemans, not purporting to offer a history, but rather a poem inspired by the bare facts, writes:\n\n    The flames rolled on—he would not go\n        Without his Father's word;\n    That father, faint in death below,\n        His voice no longer heard.\n\n\nHemans has him repeatedly, and heart-wrenchingly, calling to his father for instructions: ""'Say, Father, say/If yet my task is done;'"" ""'Speak, father!' once again he cried/'If I may yet be gone!;'"" and ""shouted but once more aloud/ 'My father! must I stay?'"" Alas, there is, of course, no response.\n\nShe concludes by commending the performances of both ship and boy:\n\n    With mast, and helm, and pennon fair,\n        That well had borne their part—\n    But the noblest thing which perished there\n        Was"

The people who need spell check don't care about their spelling.  Lots of Americans can spell.  Unfortunately, it seems that most of those who can't spell like to post on Yahoo Answers!  \nI am confused about the criticisms of the school system.  First of all, charter school are also public schools.  Secondly, I don't know any teachers (and I am an educator) who do not teach spelling.  I don't think the system is the problem as much as the parents.  Children who read at home and who have parents who speak correct English will usually spell well.

"Living Language has a CD-based course that is exceptional for many languages including Japanese. I think there are 8 Cd's. I highly recommend it. It is by far better to learn a language through your ears than through your eyes! Listen to the CD's over and over again and the nuances of pronunciation and cadence (the rhythm of the language which is important in Japanese) - look up ""Mora"" or ""Japanese Mora timing"". I recommend listening to all of the Cd's at least 3 times each while driving or something before even beginning to study them. You will be amazed how much easier it is that way. First time through play and don't even try to listen. Second time listen only with light attention. Third time pay close attention. Fourth time through start repeating whatever you want to and try to be precise in all ways -tone, pitch, cadence, pronunciation, enunciation etc.  Good luck!"

Well it depends on what country's history you're talking about. Canada has not always been a peaceful neighbor, the war of 1812 (which they won), definately had an impact on the course of US history.  If you're talking about Canadian history, there is conflict still today with the French speaking people of Quebec, with the English. Some want to make Quebec a different country all of it's own.

"The BIA? They are notoriously disorganized, mismanaged, and generally unhelpful. They have a disreputable history ever since their inception as a subgroup within the U.S. War Department. (Yes, that's where the BIA began.) They're currently facing lawsuits from many Native nations because of their incompetence in record-keeping and fund management. I often hear the BIA referred to in extremely negative terms by Native folks. I once asked a class (with some Native students in it) what the letters BIA stood for, and one Native student chimed in with ""Bossing Indians Around."" Personally, I thought he was right on target.\n\nNCAI? Extremely helpful, it seems to me. Mostly because it was started BY Native folks, FOR Native folks, in order to monitor the federal government, and inform the nations of federal legislation that was injurious to Native sovereignty and self-determination (termination policies, in particular). The NCAI is basically an umbrella coalition of nations that allows them to act in concert on issues of importance to Native peoples, like education, health care, the environment, housing, religious freedom, and sovereignty principles in general.\n\nThe NIGA -- well, it kind of depends on your stance on gaming. It is a non-profit organization designed to help Native nations that choose to use gaming as an economic tool. It's Native-run (mostly), and serves as an educational and legislative resource for these Nations. It's a critical source for nations that participate in gaming, and tries to help these nations preserve self-sufficiency by helping them negotiate the maze of gaming regulations, and establish non-exploitative working relationships with the non-Native corporations that finance initial investments. Even nations opposed to gaming recognize the need for such an advocacy and lobbying organization, though not all Native folks like the NIGA."

"Ozone depletion:\nthere are many chemicals and agents that we use on a daily basis, many people are unaware of the damage these can cause. As these element raise above, they damage the protective layer which keeps oxygen,hydrogen and monoxide in. This protective layer is basically an umbrella to shield us from the harmful rays of the sun...as it is depleted, more and more damaging rays will continue to reach the surface of the earth and cause all types of disease and problems.\n\nGreen House Effect:\nOver the years, Ozone depletion has taken it's tole on our icebergs and ice caps. As these begin to melt, our water and sea levels begin to rise. It is like placing a lid on boiling water, steam will begin to boils and thus ""global warming"" will accrue....... Warmth continues to grow faster than we can control and our green earth will begin to dry up, in time we will become a dessert and need more sunscreen just to exist on the surface...\n"" we can't stop the damage that's been done but we can slow it down and allow mother nature to heal.... \n\n\n\nQ. What is the greenhouse effect? Is it the same as the ozone hole issue? \n\nA. No, they are two different (but related) issues.The greenhouse effect issue concerns the warming of the lower part of the atmosphere, the troposphere (the layer in which temperature drops with height; it is about 10-15 kilometers thick, varying with latitude and season), by increasing concentrations of the so-called greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and others) in the troposphere. This warming occurs because the greenhouse gases, while they are transparent to incoming solar radiation, absorb infrared (heat) radiation from the Earth that would otherwise escape from the atmosphere into space; the greenhouse gases then re-radiate some of this heat back towards the surface of the Earth.\n\nThe ozone hole issue concerns the loss of ozone in the upper part of the atmosphere, the stratosphere, resulting from increasing concentrations of certain halogenated hydrocarbons (such as chlorinated fluorocarbons, known as CFCs). Through a series of chemical reactions in the stratosphere, the halogenated hydrocarbons destroy ozone in the stratosphere. This is of concern because the ozone blocks incoming ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, and portions of the ultraviolet radiation spectrum have been found to have adverse biological effects.\n\nThe greenhouse effect and ozone hole issues are, however, related. For example, CFCs are involved in both issues: CFCs, in addition to destroying stratosphere ozone, are also greenhouse gases. It has traditionally been thought there is not much mixing of the troposphere and stratosphere. But there is recent evidence of transport of stratospheric ozone into the troposphere (see ""Ozone-rich transients in the upper equatorial Atlantic troposphere,"" by Suhre et al., Nature , Vol. 388, 14 August 1997, pages 661-663, and the related discussion paper, ""Ozone clouds over the Atlantic,"" by Crutzen and Lawrence, on pages 625-626 in the same issue of Nature ). So ozone depletion in the stratosphere could result in reduced concentrations of this greenhouse gas in the troposphere. Conversely, global climate change could also affect ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric temperature and water vapor (see ""The effect of climate change on ozone depletion through changes in stratospheric water vapour,"" by Kirk-Davidoff et al., Nature, Vol. 402, 25 November 1999, pages 399-401).

Good question.  I think alot of it has to do with the standardized tests that are focused mostly on math and language arts.  In the school where I teach, the 5th grade teachers have to choose whether they are going to teach science or social studies on a day-to-day basis.  We've become fixated on bringing up test scores in math and reading (thanks to No Child Left Behind), that the rest of it has to take a back seat.

Because they are still forming their views on sex, men and women, relationships and the world in general. Porn makes sex seem meaningless, stereotypes men and women into certain roles, and de-values relationships, among other things.  Children might be attracted to porn for hormonal reasons, but letting them view it only shows them the nasty, dirty, unemotional part of sex.  Since it is very likely they are not getting that balanced out by watching meaningful, beautiful love-making, it would be best to not waste room in their young minds with porn.

Music participation provides a unique opportunity for literacy preparation. Whether the children are singing, playing, or listening, teachers direct them to listen and hear in new ways which exercises their aural discrimination. Playing instruments and adding movement to the lessons teaches children about sequential learning which is essential in reading comprehension. \n \nPlato once said that music “is a more potent instrument than any other for education”. You will find many teachers of young children who would agree with him. Recent research has found that music uses both sides of the brain, a fact that makes it valuable in all areas of development. Music affects the growth of a child’s brain academically, emotionally, physically and spiritually.\n\nMusic is academic. \nFor some people, this is the primary reason for providing music lessons to their children. A recent study from the University of California found that music trains the brain for higher forms of thinking. Second graders who were given music lessons scored 27% higher on proportional math and fractions tests than children who received no special instruction. Research indicates that musical training permanently wires a young mind for enhanced performance.\n\nMusic is physical. \nMusic can be described as a sport. Learning to sing and keep rhythm develops coordination. The air and wind power necessary to blow a flute, trumpet or saxophone promotes a healthy body.\n\nMusic is emotional.\n Music is an art form. We are emotional beings and every child requires an artistic outlet. Music may be your child’s vehicle of expression.\n\nMusic is for life. \nMost people can’t play soccer, or football at 70 or 80 years of age but they can sing. And they can play piano or some other instrument. Music is a gift you can give your child that will last their entire lives.
"Californication is a portmanteau word derived from bumper stickers frequently seen on cars in the state of Oregon during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The stickers said ""Don't Californicate Oregon"" in reference to the ongoing massive influx into Oregon of people from California. This shift was brought about largely by the completion of Interstate 5 in 1964. Prior to that time, the main route into Oregon from California was via the twisty, two-lane Oregon Highway 99. Towns like Medford, Eugene and Portland have tripled or more in size since 1964, and this population shift has been added to by the massive movement of legal and illegal immigrants mainly into the West Coast states from south of the border. The word is a blend of California and fornication, and is usually intended to convey an obscene alternate meaning."
A flame is the product of a highly exothermic reaction for example combustion, a self-sustaining oxidation reaction, or nuclear fusion in the sun. In layman's terms, a flame could be said to be, for example, the visible part of a fire.\n\nThe color and temperature of the flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion. For example: when a lighter is held to a candle. This applied heat causes the fuel molecules to evaporate, in this state they can then react with oxygen, giving off enough heat in the exothermic reaction to sustain a consistent flame. The resulting increases in temperature tear apart some of the fuel molecules, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in these products, which results in the emission of visible light. As the combustion temperature increases, so does the energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame. This is why the hottest visible flame is in the blue/violet region of the visible spectrum.

"it's easier when said ""do unto others as you would want them to do unto you"". Basically, treat people how you want them to treat you. If you want respect you have to give it. You want people to be nice to you you have to be nice to them. You can't gossip about someone, and then freak out when they gossip about you.... it's just people treating you like you treat them. So, treat people great, and you will be treated great in return."

They are graduate degrees.\n\nFirst you go to university, and get a Bachelors Degree. \n\nYou then apply into Graduate school to get a Master's Degree. \n\nLater, you apply again and do a Doctor's Degree. \n\nThese degrees can be in any major subjects. They are pretty much research based. You take a couple courses, write some tests and do research. At the end of each degree, you need to produce a thesis of your new research. \n\nSome people, with really good marks and have been prominent publishers may skip the masters degree and proceed directly to a doctorate degree.
Those SATs are going to have to be retaken if he wants any sort of chance of getting in.  I was NHS, all-state football, National Merit Finalist,  3.8 and just barely got in.\n\nThe bright side is I did not particularly enjoy my time there, outside of the social/extracurricular scene.

There was no *founder* of California, like there was no founder of America. People just settled there. We can say that the reason there are so many people in California is because of the gold rush. First there was some gold found in a creek in Sutter's mill. So I would say the founder was John Sutter.
This is dependent on a few things, in order of importance (to me at least):\n1.  How much money do you have to spend on an ADC\n2.  What is the input frequency range you want to capture\n3.  What kind of accuracy are you looking for\n\nAs you answer those questions, start looking at how different ADCs compare against what you need.  A good place to start looking is http://www.digikey.com , which sells all sorts of ADCs.
It depends on what school you go to. Call the school if you are unsure of when it starts.

The Qur'an (also Quran, Koran, Alcoran;) is the Islamic holy book of Allah (Arabic for God). Muslims believe that the Qur'an is the literal word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad over a period of 22 years. The Qur'an consists of 114 suras (chapters) with a total of 6,236 ayats (verses). The Qur'an retells stories of many of the people and events of the Jewish and Christian Bibles, although it differs in many details.

I'll give you my answer since i have a similar problem. Studied language in uni, can never use it cause there's no way to meet  friends frm that country. What i do, is just keep studying vocab, reviewing my books, reading outloud, making fun projects like I'm trying to make  recordings that would sound like a news show with a panel of guests. Write essays, and recently try helping a foreigner with language. put ads, or find ads from foreigners needing help. I found someone that is not from the country where the language i studied is used.. but hopefully someday i'll find someone.  \n\nLike you, i seem to be losing it,, but it's not lost yet so i can regain it if i do something  on time.
You may leave it as it is in the initial state, however you may wish to note the varied amounts of water. I would suggest that instead of direct water by volume, you try running your hypothesis on the basis of moisture exposure, in conjunction with sunlight, accelerating the decomposition process. More directly, the rate in which decomposition is accelerated by the introduction of both variables. Due to the introduction if varying forms and rates of decomposition, you may wish to include the parasites that become present during the breakdown stages.\n    Also, while your hypothesis is that an orange will decompose BEST in a condition combining both sunlight and water, you must allow for atmospheric conditions such as air, and temperature. But the AMOUNT of water / moisture will have a direct effect on your results.\n                  Good luck!!

Enzymes are proteins, and high temperatures cause them to denature (a process that results in the shape of the protein changing).  The shape and structure of an enzyme are vital to its ability to bind with a substrate, so once the enzyme is denatured, it will no longer be able to function.\n\nA prolonged fever could raise body temperatures high enough to denature enzymes.  Since enzymes are important for many body activities (without enzymes many chemical reactions in the body would not occur at all, occur very slowly, or result in different products) such as digestion, denaturation of many of the body's enzymes could be dangerous.  \n\nFor more information on enzymes...\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme

For you to have a good chance of earning a university sponsorship, you will need a very high score on  the SAT exam.

If you get get higher than that you may even be sponsored for full tuition and fees.  \n\nThe first step for you is to visit the Embassy.  They can tell you about other scholarships available, based on your demographics.\n\nYou will also need to take the TOEFL exam to prove your English ability.  Good luck!

You can start looking as early as your sophomore year but I would recommend mid junior year to beginning senior year. It will also depend on what kind of scholarship you are applying for and what the requirements are. Things like essay contests and other scholarship awards such as that you can apply for anytime however some require specific grades (i.e. first semester senior year, final grades, etc.) or even want to know the specific school that you are applying to. Its never too early to start looking though and seeing what the requirements are. Apply to any that you are eligable.

"The first true towns are sometimes considered to be large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power was centralized. Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations.\n\nA city is an urban area that is differentiated from a town, village, or hamlet by size, population density, importance, or legal status. In most parts of the world, cities are generally substantial and nearly always have an urban core.\n\nA city usually consists of residential, industrial and business areas together with administrative functions which may relate to a wider geographical area. A large share of a city's area is primarily taken up by housing, which is then supported by infrastructure such as roads, streets and often public transport routes such as a rapid transit system. Lakes and rivers may be the only undeveloped areas within the city. \n\n""The city is a human habitat that allows people to form relations with others at various levels of intimacy while remaining entirely anonymous."""
don't worry! i was like that too but when i entered high school, its pretty FUN and i love it. don't worry, just calm down, i garuntee you will have the greatest experience there.
"Wow. Lotsa issues for you to work out. You need to start by answering some basic questions for yourself: \n\n-- How much money will you have to live on? \n-- What inescapable expenses will you have? (E.g., rent, tuition, books, insurance?)\n\nWhen you know what your ""disposable"" income will be, then look for things where you have control. Take transportation: Any public transportation is cheaper than keeping a car. Riding a bike or walking are cheapest of all. So it's worth spending a little bit more on rent to live close to work and school, for instance. \n\nAs for jobs, your choices are going to be dictated by your school schedule and your skills. All things being equal, consider  fringe benefits like paid vacation days, sick leave, free or discounted goods and services. If you can get a job with the school where you are studying, that's usually a great deal. It saves you commuting costs and time, and may get you a break on tuition.  \n\nAs far as feeding yourself, first consider any special nutritional needs you may have (allergies, etc.), then learn how to cook the basics. It takes no great skill to boil spaghetti or scramble an egg. A microwave is a great tool for making things like ramen noodles (one of those cheap basics you can eat every day, with variations). Fresh veggies and fruit are quite inexpensive, compared to anything prepared, carry-out or frozen. Same with meats, although if you are really pinched, you will need to explore all the meat alternatives -- beans and rice, for instance, have tons of protein. There's always tofu, if you can stomach it (I can't). Work in a little indulgence here and there -- some real butter, homemade brownies, an occasional bottle of wine, whathave you -- to keep you happy. You don't want to feel like a prisoner. But, man, watch out for beer. College students the world over go broke and fry their brains on ""cheap"" beer.\n\nSpend a little time in the cookbook section of the local library and find a good, basic guide, like ""Cooking for Dummies,"" or any one of a ton of cheap-eats books. Make sure you pick a book that is understandable and appealing to you; if you're confused, you won't use it.\n\nWatch out for sodas, chips, snacks, etc. Ounce for ounce, they are very expensive and do your body no good.\n\nOtherwise, you need to think about things like entertainment. Can you live without movies, DVDs, video games, new CDs? If not, put yourself on a fun budget, and explore what you can find for free at the library, and for cheap at used-goods stores.\n\nAlso, study the local newpapers, weeklies and entertainment guides. There are always tons of cool, free or low-cost things to do in a great city like Vancouver. You can have massive amounts of fun and meet fabulous people by seeking out the cheapo fun. (Beware of cults; they give away a lot of free food.)\n\nIf you have a clothes jones or gadget habit, again, you'll need to put yourself on a strict budget. It's impulse spending that will land you in big trouble. Find out where all the thrift stores in town are, and go there first when you need something. Never buy anything on store credit.\n\nIf you can get by without one, do not get a credit card. If you must have one, do NOT use it except for EXTREME emergencies.\n\nLiving alone can be disconcerting for someone who has grown up with people around all the time. But it's also a great adventure. It forces you to learn a lot about yourself, and it forces you to go out and make friends. Just don't do anything incredibly dumb, and you will have such a great time during these years that you won't miss money at all."

Sadly, despite what the publishers of tons of different products claim, it's hard to have a huge impact on your GMAT scores quickly, so don't go that route.  Assuming you have some time, the best way to increase your scores is to increase your vocabulary.  Read as much professional literature as you can get your hands on.  Remember, a little stress will help you, but a lot of stress will kill your scores.  Get up early the day of the exam and eat a good breakfast, wake up that brain, then as best as you can, 'relax'.  I've known lots of people who've tried a lot of different methods, but the key is to FEEL confident, FEEL relaxed and be CONFIDENT.  Your scores will improve.

"Site 1\n\nHenry Cavendish \n1731 - 1810\nRoyal Connections. Henry Cavendish was born on October 10, 1731 in Nice, France, where his family was living at the time.  His mother was Lady Anne Gray, daughter of the Duke of Kent and his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, son of the second Duke of Devonshire.  The family traces its lineage across eight centuries to Norman times and was closely connected to many aristocratic families of Great Britain. \n  \n\nEducation.    At age 11, Henry Cavendish was a pupil at Dr. Newcome's School in Hackney.  At age 18, (1749) he entered Cambridge in St. Peter's College.  He left without graduating four years later.  His first paper Factitious Airs appeared 13 years later. \n\nEccentric in life.  Henry Cavendish had a peculiarly odd demeanor.  He was morbidly shy of women and strangers and avoided ever speaking to them.  He wore a coat of faded velvet and a three-cornered cocked hat from the previous century so he must have looked almost as curious to his con-temporaries as he does to us.  He admitted to a ""singular love of solitariness.""  He was a tall man with a thin, squeaky voice.  He spoke with hesitation and difficulty, especially when embarrassed.  At home, his servant was instructed by written notes what to prepare for dinner — usually 'a leg of mutton.' \n\n""[Cavendish] probably uttered fewer words in the course of his life than any man who lived to fourscore years.""   -Lord Brougham""1\n\n     Henry Cavendish was extremely wealthy, but was not bothered by money.  Through inheritances, he became the single largest holder of bank stock in England.  His single social outlet was his membership in the Royal Society Club, an organization whose members dined together before weekly meetings.  Cavendish seldom missed these meetings.  He was profoundly respected by his contemporaries.  Henry Cavendish died on March 10, 1810.2 \n  \n  Factitious Airs.  In this 1766 paper,3 Cavendish reported his results of careful quantitative study of gases already known using meticulous laboratory techniques.  He was also tedious, often repeating an experiment numerous times.  He dried the gases and compensated for temperature and pressure and characterized them for the first time by specific gravity.  \nHydrogen (Inflammable air). Cavendish is generally credited with the discovery of inflammable air which he eventually came to believe was pure phlogiston. Inflammable air had been collected and studied by others, starting with Boyle, for over a century, however Cavendish's careful studies involving specific gravity established the gas as a individual substance.  Prior to this, there were various inflammable airs including the gas produced from heating charcoal (now known to be CO).  Regarding the gas obtained from metals by dissolution in sulphuric or muriatic acid, Cavendish wrote: \n\n""...their phlogiston flies off, without having its nature changed in the acid, and forms the inflammable air""\n  \nEquipment used by Cavendish for the manipulation of gases. \n\n\nWater.  Cavendish will always be associated with a role in unraveling the composition of water through careful experimentation. \n\n""...on applying the lighted paper to the mouth of the bottle... With 3 parts of inflammable air to 7 of common air, there was a very loud noise.""4 \n\n""By the experiments with the globe it appeared that when inflammable and common air are exploded in a proper proportion, almost all of the inflammable air and near one-fifth of the common air lose their elasticity, and are condensed into dew.""5\n\nSparks.  Explosions are initiated by spark.  In the 1760s the only known way to obtain an electric spark was to rotate a glass globe called an or cylinder while pressing a pad against it.  \n\n     Cavendish went on to react dephlogisticated air (now O2) with inflammable air (H2) and established the optimal proportion as 2.02:1. \n\n deplogisticated air +  "
If there are three combinations and each can go from 0 to 9, there are ten possibilities. So you have 10 choices for the first number. For each of these, you have 10 choices for the second number, so there are 10*10=100 choices. For each of these, there are 10 separate choices for the third number, so there are 100*10=1000 choices.
"Linguists study language and the meaning of words.\n\nOne of the most fascinating classes I took in college was Philosophy of Linguistics thru the school's philosophy dept. \n\nIf you want to really know HOW people think...and really try to get a grasp around language and how it affects thinking and understanding...take a lingustics course. I don't mean ""oo"" sounds versus ""eww"" sounds or anything like that. \n\nI mean examining questions like ""If an ethnic group has 17 different words for types of snow...does that group look at snow in a different way than a group that has one word for 'snow'.""\n\nOr ""If a group has no word for 'birthday' or 'birth date', what does that say linguistically about their concept of time and age?"" \n\nMaybe this answer is way over the edge..a bit ethereal...or, maybe it will kinda 'click' with someone...."
Usually studying abroad requires being a part of an American university for at least a year before you are accepted into the SA program. Often, after taking a few classes and learning a little about what programs are offered through your particular school, you'll have a more clear idea. You will probably also be required to take at least one/two semesters of whatever language your instruction will be in while in the foreign country, so that's something to consider. Look at your local colleges; many have programs that are connected. Bretheran Colleges have a program that connects 6 colleges across the US and offer study abroad programs in over 11 countries. Many Lutheran colleges have similar programs. Cal State schools find it harder to get funding than private universities, so you might consider that as well. My last recommendation is to visit your local Community colleges and see if they have a bulletin board or some sort of advertising space that may offer short-term study abroad options. If you like the program enough in a short amount of time and make friends/connections wherever you study, you might find it easier to find further opportunities there.\n  I have lived in Germany, Greece, England, and South America with different study abroad programs my whole life. Each culture is different, interesting, and wonderful and you'll enjoy wherever you go, as long as you have a healthy frame of mind before you leave!

Hmmm.\n\nFriend of mine was devoted to idea of being a journalist.   Got his first job, then an oil disaster killed 170 people and he was sent to doorstep their families.   He ditched journalism.\n\nBroadcast journalism different, sure.\n\nThe gap in the market: a journalist (broadcast or otherwise) who knows sh1t.   Go get under the skin of some area of knowledge or life - get thoroughly into it - while you follow your plan.   Then, when you're on camera, you'll have something worthwhile to say.   That will make you different.
If you study the largest countries and their economic influence in the world what do you see the future calls for?\n\nI see: Languages (Mandarin Chinese; English; and another language - but for sure the first 2); International Business.  You have done the economics - continue but in International Language.  I'd see your counselor and see if you can do your last year maybe in a university overseas that they approve of (accept transcripts). My niece is going to Guangzhou University (Guangzhou used to be Canton) and is studying Mandarin and International Business.  Many students from UK and other countries around the world - they have realized w.the world is heading.  \n\nNext question: WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY?  That is so important. Anymore, remember, companies don't hire you for life - so you have to be motivated, HAPPY, and be willing to move/change be flexible.  \n\nSo a major and a minor is important.\n\nIf you w/not so far along, I'd say fields in medicine that are needed.  For example, in the State of NC we only have 74 pediatric dentists, can you believe?  Also, in the USA, we are hiring nurses from around the world to fill our vacancies. \n\nSo what to do. First and foremost make an inventory of your strengths and weaknesses - you know which they are. BE BRUTAL with yourself - nobody needs to see this list, if you don't want.\n\nNext, list of what you want and definitely don't want out of life - next 5/10 years - can't go further than that.\n\nDo you have a labor department that will give you a census of jobs and what jobs are hard to fill?  We have it in the USA and you could focus on something you like on that list.\n\nIf you have doubts - maybe ask a company tolet you work during the summer/intern to see if this is something that attracts you.\n\nAnother area of concern because we are getting much older and we can't rely any longer on taking care of our elders at home....so that generation will need help - professional help?  What is it where you live?

GRE is an entrance exam for gradute students applying for post graduate studies in the US. it is mainly for students interested in pursuing a career in the science, technology or engineering field.

yes teens are very impressionate and can be influence by watching tv or people on the street
OK... let's see all your options.\nTo work in the USA you either need a work visa or a green card.\nWork visa will give you the right to work for a limited amount of time, while with a green card you can live and work in the USA basically for ever.\nFor a work visa, you need a company to sponsor you. For a green card, you can get one with a company's sponsorship, with the 'green card lottery' aka diversity visa, serving in the military or marrying an american.\nUsually, it's hard to get sponsorship for a green card by an american company. It's expensive and takes a lot of time (1-5 years). Usually, you come on a work visa, and while you're on a work visa, you do the green card at the same time.\nThere are several types of work visas. The easiest to get is the J1, which is for an 'internship' or 'stage'. It costs around $500 to do and can be obtained in a couple of weeks. It is valid for up to 18 months. H1B is harder to obtain, but it can last for up to 6 years. Usually you need a degree or a specialization to obtain one. \nYou can do the visa papers yourself, but there are agencies and lawyers that can do the paperwork for you (if you pay them, of course).
The importance of quality is a tough topic...could you go somewhere along the lines of the importance of teamwork in order to ensure quality.  I know of tons of team building games.  I good resource would be Kagan.  I think if you search Kagan team building activities in the Internet you may come up with some ideas.  This can provide activities for you workshop that keep participants engaged, learning about each other, and staff strength and weaknesses.  It is designed for in classrooms but will work well with adults.

"David Henry Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts, of John and Cynthia Thoreau.   He was named after a recently deceased paternal Uncle, David Thoreau. He did not change his name to ""Henry David"" until he had graduated from Harvard, although he never petitioned the government to do so officially  \n\nThoreau first contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically over his life.[5] In 1859, following a late night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rain storm, he became extremely ill. His health declined over three years with brief periods of remission, until he eventually became bedridden\n\n\nOur truest life is when we are in our dreams awake. \n-- Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862)"

"This may produce more questions than answers for you  :)\n\nIt depends on what kind of chemistry you want to study... bio-chemistry; pharmaceuticals; textiles-chemistry; packaging sciences; etc. etc.\n\nIn New York State there are many Chemistry programs: St. John's University has a pharmaceutical program... Queens College of the City University of New York has a BioChemistry program (also with a connection to Psychology); Rochester Institute has a packaging sciences program; State Univeristy of New York at Stonybrook has a medical program with connected hospital.\n\nIf you're not sure which branch(es) of Chemistry you want to study, do some research on University Laboratories and Research Facilities.  I'm sure they are all ""State-of-the-art"" and ""award-winning"", but just reading about the various ones should help narrow down your decisions.  :)"

What are your interests? What do you think you might want to do? Most people change their majors several times before they declare it in their junior year. You should try out a variety of things that interest you and talk to your counselors about it, too. You can change your major many times. Exploring is the best way to find out.
in an exam list the facts first, then give some examples.  make sure you are answering the question, otherwise you are going to use exam time to write bull and not get full credit for it.

When I lived in Sri Lanka (15 years ago) there where many festivals. What they were depended upon the time of year, the caste membership and/or the religion of the participants.  There is the veneration of the Bodhi-tree, another one of the religious festivals of Sri Lanka is Vesak, it commemorates the birth of Buddha. They celebrate their National New Year Aluth Avurudhu in Sinhala and Puththandu in Tamil.\nOther festivals and ceremonies depend, again upon if the people are living in the hills, seashore or elsewhere.  The clothes for many are the same as the western world.  Many women wear saris/sarees.  They are wrapped in a special manner and are beautiful. The men sometimes wear business suits, cotton is the best fabric and you might see them wear a white sarong and a white shirt that comes almost down to the knees. As far as foods, mostly I remember a lot of rice! But many people from many lands have lived in and settled in Sri Lanka-- you can find foods of many origins--even burgers and fries. I remember the local colas were good and I loved the flat bread made from chick-pea flour.
"A ""steal"" or ""steal syndrome"" occurs when, as a result of dilation of the blood vessels or a ""short-circuit"" (fistula) between two blood vessels, blood is directed toward already well-oxygenated tissue and away from already oxygen-stressed tissue.\n\nWhen this occurs in the heart, it's called ""coronary steal.""  In that case, typically there is a blocked coronary artery; a vasodilator is administered and, as a result, oxygen is shunted away from the already oxygen-starved (ischemic) tissue.\n\nHowever, there can also be subclavian steal, cerebral steal, etc.\n\nA steal is sometimes called ""Robin Hood syndrome,"" but this should properly be used only to describe an ""inverse steal,"" in which the blood vessels constrict, thus robbing from the (oxygen) rich and giving to the (oxygen) poor."

Yes (short answer). Each state may impose a higher minimum wage than another but never lower than the federal government's mandate (currently: $5.15). You need to check with the local government. Most states do adhere strictly to the federal standard (neither raising or lowering their own standard). Vermont is, for example, one state which has a higher rate (though I don't recall their rate).\n\nSorry, I read the question wrong... thought you were asking about min. wage. Of course there's no other way to find the wage rate without the hours and total amount. Simple algebra:\n\nr * h = t  (r: rate per hour, h: hours worked, t: total amount earned)
i'm assuming that you mean that they didn't get into an impacted major right away as a freshman...right?\n\nwell, you have a couple of choices: \n1) Attend a community college and work on transfering into that major at a later date.  Keep those grades up though...\n2) Attend another university that has the major you want that you can get into.\n3) Attend the original university and try to transfer into the selecting major at a later date.  This can be tricky depending on if you can get the courses you need to declare that major.  You need to speak to an advisor right away about this.\n4) Attend the original university and select another major that is similar enough to give you most of the same classes and hope for the best.  \n\nKeep in mind that most people change their minds, so what you want to start with might not be what you ultimately end up with.  This might be fates way to tell you that you don't really want that major ;)
I would suggest buying a book that you can carry around with you also. You will pick it up easily. Good luck.

"The correct choice is ""C: 1,000 Hz.""  If you go to a piano keyboard, the A below ""middle C"" is at 440 Hz.  Every time you jump up one octave to the next A, you double your frequency, so the A above middle C is 880 Hz, and the one above that is 1760 Hz.  Since 1000 Hz falls between those two (obviously audible) notes, it must be audible itself.\n\nIn fact, every half-step (walking up the keyboard, both black and white keys) is about 6% higher in frequency.  As it turns out, the B and C above middle C are at about 987.8 and 1046.5 Hz, respectively, so your 1000 Hz tone is between them."

"Heed BoredLawyer.  (Why is he bored???)\n\nYou can always reword a sentence you find difficult: ""On Mary's and my behalf""; ""On Mary's behalf and mine"", etc.  Usually it's a good rule to discard ""myself"" - it can sound pompous and unnecessary.  A lot of other people have a good rule to work by: take out the other person and see how it sounds:""John took a picture of Mary and I"" is incorrect when you say: ""John took a picture of I"".  And you don't need the ""myself"" - ""John took a picture of Mary and myself"" should be simply: ""John took a picture of Mary and me"".  ""Myself"" works in, for example, ""John thinks roses are lovely; Mary does not.  I, myself, think they are all right"".\n\nGrammar does not change in the English-speaking world, whereas slang and colloquialisms do.  It would be silly to announce yourself correctly saying:""It is I!""

You will find that this is a little bit of a pain since it will entail completing a new Master Promissory Note for each lender (and might confuse your school a little bit if they are expecting you to borrow from once place and you go elsewhere).  \n\nHaving multiple lenders can benefit you, though, if you plan on consolidating later. See, students who borrow every single student loan from the same lender are bound by something known as the ""single holder rule."" Simply put, this rule states that a students with loans help by a single lender *must* consolidate with that lender.  So, if all your loans are with Citibank, you must consolidate with Citibank, even if Sallie Mae is offering better borrower benefits.\n\nNow, you probably shouldn't attempt to borrow from two Stafford lenders during the same enrollment period at the same school (for example, if you were awarded $3,500 as a Sophomore, you shouldn't attempt to borrow $1,750 from Citibank and $1,750 from Sallie Mae). While this isn't expressly forbidden, it's... well, weird and could cause a big mess (you could be responsible for an overpayment, your loan disbursements could be delayed, etc.). \n\nKeep in mind that interest rates on Stafford Loans are set by the federal government, so your underlying interest rates on any Staffords will be the same. The only reason you'd want to ""shop around"" would be to obtain one of the many ""borrower benefits"" out there for student loan borrowers (interest rate reductions, principal reductions, etc.).  However, it's unlikely that one bank will offer a benefit that's enormously better than another bank's benefit (the borrower benefits will be different, yes, but in the end, they tend to add up to similar savings).  \n\nFor more information about borrower benefits and about the ""single holder rule,"" which is still in effect, check out these pages:\n\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/singleholderrule.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/loans/choosing.phtml\nhttp://www.finaid.org/calculators/loananalyzer.phtml"

you are going through the toughest years of your life now and you are maturing and realizing the enormity of your future. Everyone feels this way... and since you associate the books with college... and you associate college with growing up and moving away... this would give anyone anxiety! My advice is to not worry too much about growing up too fast- believe me ENJOY the years you are experiencing now- and dont grow up too fast. Be a teenager and have fun!

Sat for the exam last October, got 8.5.\n\nI will advice you to purchase their study material which comprises some past questions and audio CDs for you to practice with. \nPractice speaking in front of a little audience so that you do not get nervous during your speaking test/interview. During the interview make sure you dont speak too fast. Speak clearly and try to use the best words possible to explain yourself. You do not necessarily have to use 'big' or complex words.\n\nFor your wirtting test it is important to answer only what you are asked because there is not time to waste, most people's greatest problem is the time factor as I can promise you the time  will never be enough. That is why when you practice with their study material you must time yourself and keep to that time so you can know if and when you are ready for the real exam.\n\nBest of luck.

I was kind of in the same situation. I started my freshman year in civil engineering, which I wanted to do since I was in junior high. My first year was ok, but I knew that engineering didn't really fit me well. I especially didn't like all of the physics I had to take. I thought about it for a while and then switched my major to accounting. I love it now and don't think that I could have made a better decision. If the structural engineering is still your heart's desire then keep at it. People fail classes, but they can bounce back. You sound pretty motivated, so I wouldn't let one class keep you down. I started out each semester with 18 hrs, but cut it down to 12-15 since I have to work and provide for a family. Keep in mind that alot of people switch majors at least once in their college career. Good luck and keep working hard.

Research is proving that a 20 minute nap mid day works wonders.  In fact, when I ran a lab I asked my boss if it was ok NOT to take first break but bump it into my lunch break.  That made 45 minutes for lunch.  I'd nap for 20 then have 25 min for lunch.

The ideal manager is one who isn't afraid of work and commitment.\nThey should be fair yet firm, strict yet approachable and above all be understanding to his consumer! Whether right or wrong morally, the customer is always right and any good manager should uphold this and make their staff aware of the protocol.\n\nAn ideal manager should have happy and reliable staff working under him which makes for an excellent work force ensuring greater customer care.  This makes a good foundation for any business.\n\nThe manager of any business should understand the environment they are working in. They should ensure they know each and every product available, when it will be in stock, how it works, what the next best product is etc. \nIn my experience, the best type of Manager is one who has worked their way from the bottom to the top. They have worked directly with the public and are therefore aware of the demands and pit falls with being in such an environment.

"The Globe Theatre was not built until 1599, when most scholars agree that he had already completed about 20 of his 38-or-so plays.  There are instances of Shakespeare's plays being performed in at least two of ""The Inns of Court"", which are four law schools in London: The Comedy of Errors in 1594, and Twelfth Night in 1602.\n\nHe was a stock-holder and an actor in the Lord Chamberlain's Men from 1594-on (the theatre was closed from 1592-1594 due to an outbreak of the plague), with performances before her majesty Queen Elizabeth I.  This is from the-quill.com: ""During the years Shakespeare performed with the Chamberlain's Men, before their purchase of the Globe in 1599, they played primarily at the well-established theatres like the Swan, the Curtain, and the Theatre. The troupe would also give regular performances before Elizabeth I and her court, and tour the surrounding areas of London.""\n\nSo I suppose the answer to the question should be a).  It appears that Shakespeare did quite a bit of writing and performing before the Globe Theatre was even built.  \n\nGood luck!"

"From the different documentaries, I have seen and the article from National Geographic, I'm inclined to conclude that Sheba was a territory in the South-West of the Arabian Penisula in an area that is now around the Yemen and Saudi Arabian border area. There was discussion of a lost city covered by sand dunes in this area, recently discovered by satellite imagery. The archeologists are now studying these ruins. I think that may be the key to Sheba. Hope this is of help.\n\nTo Arabs, Sheba was Bilqis, a queen of the incense-rich lands of ancient Saba in what is now Yemen. \n\nEarthly Queen \n\nScholars believe that if there were an actual Queen of Sheba and she did visit King Solomon, it would have happened about 950 B.C. \n\nEarly research dated Saba back to 650 B.C. By the time Clapp began his search for the historical queen, however, archaeologists had used carbon-14 dating to show that Saba had an alphabet, and thus civilization, that dated back to 1200 B.C. \nBut it was in Yemen where Clapp came closest to the object of his pursuit. Using space images and a device for global positioning system navigation, Clapp conspired with drivers dazed by qat (a narcotic leaf) to follow an ancient caravan route leading to ruins where Sheba's tomb may lie. \n\n""With that civilization now coming into focus, the biblical account of Sheba and Solomon assumes the marking of a real event and by association gives Solomon credibility as a historical figure,"" Clapp notes in his book. \n\nBibical Queen Revised \n\nThe Yemeni ruins of Ma'rib and Sirwah indicate that the Sabeans were an advanced civilization with characteristics that match legends about Sheba, said Clapp. The sites also allow for an archaeological interpretation of I Kings 10:1-13. \n\nAccording to Clapp, Sheba was probably a powerful merchant queen of Saba who capitalized on the domestication of the camel to open trade routes to the Fertile Crescent Israel, Damascus, Sidon, and Tyre. \n\nIn this interpretation, her visit to King Solomon, a hill country chieftain, was a high-powered trade meeting. \n\nThe ""difficult questions"" Sheba asks Solomon in their biblical meeting may have centered on long-range trade, said Clapp. And the gifts she is said to have given to Solomon ""a hundred and twenty talents of gold and great quantities of spices and precious stones"" are commodities for distribution. \n\nIn turn, Solomon gave Sheba ""all she expressed a wish for."" Clapp says that in mercantile terms, that wish might have been for passage to the lucrative markets of the Fertile Crescent. The phrase also raises the possibility of an affair of the heart, giving greater credence to the myth of Menelik. \n\nExcavation of the Ma'rib and Sirwah sites is ongoing. ""Will there be a day when the Queen of Sheba's tomb is discovered?"" Clapp asks. ""[The civilization] went on for 1,800 years, not one of their tombs have been found yet. There is a huge trove of discovery to come."" \n\nFrom the second link:\n\nSheba (from the English transcription of the Hebrew name sh'va, also Saba, Arabic: سبأ) is a southern kingdom mentioned in the Jewish scriptures (Old Testament) and the Qur'an. The actual location of the historical kingdom is disputed between Ethiopia and Yemen. In the Old Testament genealogy of the nations (Genesis 10:7), Sheba, along with Dedan, is listed as one of the descendents of Noah's son Ham (i.e. son of Raamah son of Cush son of Ham). In Genesis 25:3, Sheba and Dedan are listed as sons of Jokshan. Another Sheba is listed in the Genesis 10 genealogy as a descendent of Noah's son Shem, i.e. a Semite. (There the genealogy lists Sheba as son of Joktan son of Eber son of Shelah son of Arphaxad son of Shem.) The nation makes its first appearance in world literature in the form of the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis, in Islamic tradition), who travels to Jerusalem to check out the fame of King Solomon (1 King"

There are a few prestigious universities in Asia-Pacific.\n\nBut if I had to recommend only one to a foreign student, it would be the National University of Singapore.\n\nThere are some important factors:\n\n1) Among the Asia-Pacific countries, Singapore scores very highly for its education system. It is a proven system that is admired by even the Americans who have incorporated the Singapore teaching system within their own country, particularly in the way Maths is taught.\n\n2) Proximity to facilities and housing.\nA smaller country like Singapore allows a foreign student who is studying there to spend very little time travelling and commuting. The mass rapid transit system (MRT) is world class and housing is relatively cheaper and abundant because the predominant housing structures in this country are high-rise apartments. Food and supermarkets are around every block. Everything you need is within your neighbourhood. You do not need a car to study in Singapore.\n\n3) Language and racial harmony.\nThis is the number one quality that makes Singapore a top choice for foreign students. Its pristine record for civil orderliness is unrivalled, not only within Asia-Pacific itself, but arguably the whole world. Singapore has a most unique blend of cultures that allows a foreign student of any nationality to blend in and be accepted; it can be likened to a New York City of Asia.\n\n4)The weather and greenery.\nSingapore is Summer 365 days a year. When you look up at the skies, it looks exactly like the blue ones you see in a Hawaii postcard. There is no smog, no industrial pollution. The weather is warm, but bright and sunny. Everywhere you go, it's like a beautiful garden with greenery everywhere.\n\n5) Every student, no matter where he studies, has a clubbing streak.\nSingapore has one of the best clubbing scenes in Asia-Pacific. The world-famous Zouk and Velvet Underground, Clarke Quay area, Ministry of Sound  and the beach parties on Palawan Beach are constantly evolving and current. But what makes all of them stand out is that they are clean. The drug culture in Singapore is miniscule, an embarassment almost. That is why alot of foreign parents send their children to study in Singapore; if they can't control them, at least they know they won't get into serious trouble.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to say that the National University of Singapore is my recommendation to you and I have listed some factors you may consider when making your choice. But whatever your final decision, I wish you success in your studies and a bright future ahead. GOOD LUCK!\n\nCheers!\nALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF LIFE

As a teacher of 40 years, I continue to be amused at what people think tutors are worth. These same people don't blink an eye paying upwards of $50 an hour for someone to fix their car or $60 or more for a plumber or an electrician just to knock on their door. But when it comes to paying a highly qualified, well-educated tutor, they want to pay $5 an hour, or if they are extravagant, $12 an hour. I earned $5 an hour tutoring 45 years ago!! I'm afraid the price has gone up!!\n\nToday, if I offered my services as a tutor, I would charge $50 an hour and not a penny less. I would be worth every penny because of my training and experience. I would be worth at least as much as it would be to get your car fixed.\n\nDon't sell yourself short!! Charge a reasonable fee, and in your case because you are still a student, I would say $30 an hour would be fair.\n\nGood Luck!!!
Since the MCAT is a pre req to med school, and med schools would require a transcript from an undergrad program, the average age of an MCAT taker would be around 20 years old.  However, if you are a genius of any sort and have completed the requirements ahead of the rest of the applicants the age at which you were to apply would be different.  Make sure you have done all the pre-work before even considering it.  Otherwise you will have to take it multiple times... not good!

the rosetta stone program is pretty good, just take a lot of time on it and dont rush through it.  but if you want to be fluent, it shouldnt be the only thing you use.  try looking up child spanish sites.  i say child sites because they will have the basic words that you need to get by, rather than the adult sites that may have more complicated words.  see if you can try to understand what the site is saying.  that will help you get some extra practice.  good luck.

Don't be too obvious about what you are doing.  Don't offend anyone!  Truthfully there isn't much you can do about other people's actions.  Just set a good example.  You ain't got nothing to lose.

"Cell phone is short for cellular phone.  Cellular refers to the technology used.  Also, a mobile phone can almost be considered as just about any phone that can leave a base and does not have a cord.\n\nAs quoted from source:  \n\n""Term used currently in the United States and Canada (and in other countries as well during the 1980s) to refer to most mobile phones. It technically applies specifically to mobile phones which use a cellular network. In developing mobile phone technology, American electrical engineers saw the main technical problem as achieving a smooth handoff from one radio antenna to the next. After the name ""cell"" was applied to the zone covered by each antenna, it was a natural choice for them to apply the term ""cellular"" to both the technology and the phones that ran on it."""

"Unfortunately University of Phoenix gets a bad rap. The truth is the school is Regionally Accredited and has the SAME accredidation as Arizona State University, University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University (Along with Yale, Harvard and all your other well knowns). The school is private, tax payers are not funding part of the tuition therefore it can be more costly to attend. Online education is becoming so wide spread, that ""brick and mortar"" Universities (Arizona State for example) are scrambling to give people the online education that they are desperately seeking. I have personal experience with UOP and really, if you cannot attend school at a ground campus it is a fabulous solution. The only bad experiences I've heard of is people thinking they are ready to get thier degree and they aren't, and now have student loans to pay off. Education is a huge investment, and worth every penny. In a year I should be done with my Masters of Business at University of Phoenix, I recieved my Bachelors at ASU, and because of the convenience of online, I prefer UOP. If you aren't ready or willing to do what it takes to get your degree, you are wasting your time and money no matter where you go."
"I think this will work with this age group been a while I have work with Children this age.\nI like the Glass of water. This is fun to do! Take two DIFFERENT Glasses, one narrow and tall and one short and fat! Then in front of the Children fill a Measuring Cup with ONE cup of water. Pour into glass number one. Then repeat pouring into glass number two! ;-D  Ask them to pick which glass has the most water!!! Hee, Hee. It so fun, most times they pick the Tall narrow glass because, well, it look like MORE!! Ha!!! Then you can explain Measurement Concept using the measuring cup, show them it the Exact same! BUT, because the glasses are shaped Different, one look like it have more! Hope you understand what I saying. Then you can work from here to TEACH the importance of using different measuring Devices to Really know what is correct!! It a blast! Just be Patience, as, it can take time for Children to see this Concept.\nIK has a good one with the Candy Bar. What I do is a one-on-one here, so fun, you take a candy bar and say you going to half it with a Child. Then Break it uneven (3/4-1/4) and measure the two pieces side by side so the child see one is bigger!!! Then you keep the big one and give the smaller to the Child, hopefully he/she will respond yours bigger! Then you say sorry and put the two pieces back together, so child sees, and Bite them off even eating that part, then you say; ""there, now it even"", and hand them a piece!!! It is GREAT!!!!! Then you can use a Ruler to show how this could have been done Fair!\nHEY!!!! Better add this, IF, you do the candy bar, be sure you know what candy a child can have. As, in, Dibetic etc. AND, be prepared to gain a little weight! ;-p AND, have a whole candy for them to take home, then, they not feel cheated!"

"In general, you can't simply ""get rid of"" your student loans.  Repaying your student loans will continue to be your responsibility and there are no easy answers for anyone looking to shake off this burden.  \n\nIt isn't exactly possible to ""negotiate"" a lower payoff, but it is possible to arrange an alternative payment plan -- some of these plans require very minimal payments for your first few years of repayment.  Among the plans to ask your lender about: interest-only repayment; graduated repayment; income sensitive/contingent repayment, extended repayment, etc.\n\nFederal Loan Consolidation is often the fastest way to lower your monthly payment and, sometimes, even your overall costs.  It's a good option for borrowers looking to extend their repayment term which, in turn, lowers the monthly payments, often significantly.\n\nOK, about bankruptcy...\n\nFor the most part, you heard correctly: Federal Stafford Loans cannot be forgiven, even if the borrower files for bankruptcy. Perkins Loans can sometimes be forgiven/cancelled/discharged when the borrower has filed for bankruptcy. However, I DO NOT recommend filing for bankruptcy on the off-chance that your Perkins might be discharged. It generally does more harm than good.\n\nOne other option you might have is Loan Forgiveness.  If you work for 5 years as a teacher in a low-income or subject-shortage area, all of your Perkins Loans and *some* of your Stafford Loans can be forgiven.  Teaching is pretty much the only way to have your Stafford loans forgiven, but if you have Perkins Loans, there may be others: law enforcement/corrections officers, those in the HeadStart program, early intervention service providers, PeaceCorps and ACTION volunteers, nurses, military personnel, etc. can all have their Perkins Loans forgiven in part or in full.  For more information, see here: http://www.finaid.org/loans/forgiveness.phtml"

what an intriguing question!  so do i get two points and 3 pennies?
Yeah....it makes everyone equally poor and makes life equally suck for everyone.\n\nThe bottom line is this, it is good for society that the more able, intelligent and valuable members be given certain important jobs and have greater access to resources.  Those with lesser skill and ability or whom are of low value, are that way by choice.  Giving them positions of authority or giving them greater access to resources is highly damaging.  This also has little to do with race or race relations or anything.  It is solely a function of choice.  And being a function of choice, not only is it highly inappropriate to give lesser people preference over better people, based on race, it is disasterous to do so.\n\nFurther, it is highly counter-productive to have preferences with regard to social equality.  What you are doing is removing the incentive for these people to choose to be equal.  That is very, very bad for them.  Not only will most members of the preferred group see no point in improving themselves, the situation tends to favor those who show up for a situation first, rather than those who actually improve themselves.  That college that lets in unqualified black students, is, in effect, giving those slots on a first come, first serve basis, shutting out the QUALIFIED black students that come later.  It becomes pointless to work to become qualified.  And then the reputation, standards and quality of that college disintergrate.\n\nThis isn't social theory, btw.  It is the repeating pattern that has ALWAYS happened every time preferences are instituted.  It has been tried many, many times and there have been no exceptions.  Every single instance has resulted in dramatic failure.\n\nPreference based on merit is the ONLY workable solution.  Ironically, it is the ONLY path to social equality.\n\nRacial preferences are racist.  And racism hurts.

"One of the most exciting excercises I ever did as a kid was to make a scale model of the Solar System. Most of the pictures in my books made the distance between planets seem small and easy to travel. Museums were no help either. The models they displayed usually had the sizes of the planets to scale, but the distances between them were a completly different scale, giving the impression of a rather close-knit family. \n\nI made my first scale model on a roll of teletype paper tape (anyone remember that stuff?) On this 1-inch tape, my Sun was the size of the tape - 1 inch in diameter. It all started out well. Mercury was only about 3-1/2 feet from the sun and Earth was almost 9 feet from the Sun. What I didn't bargain for was that Pluto was 354 feet down the tape! I used up almost the entire roll. \n\nI also calculated the sizes that I should make the dots that represented the planets. I found that even the largest planet, Jupiter, should have a spot size smaller than 1/8 inch. The other planets, especially the small rocky inner planets, would be virtually invisible dust spots. \n\nNeedless to say, this was an eye-opening experience. This one excercise taught me the real meaning of the word ""space."" It sure made me feel insignificant looking at the scale of the Solar System - never mind the rest of the universe!"

The major curriculum requirements will be the same for either a BA or a BS, but most universities identify their Arts degrees as representing that the person has taken at least two years of a foreign language.  The choice, therefore, lies in whether or not a foreign language would be beneficial to your long-term goals.\n\nTo become any form of a counselor, most states require at least a masters degree to acheive licensing to work with lesser issues.  For more complex areas of therapy, not only must one study more psych and counseling techniques but one must also know how to diagnose physical and experiential causes, modes of treatments for each condition, biochemical causations and psychoactive medications which may intercept or relieve the conditions -- or make them worse.  Too, one must learn various research techniques, pertinent laws, case report writing, statistical analysis, legal research, writing of legal case briefs, and a myriad of other related things.  It also involves doing several courses involving practicums, meaning being graded on supervised hands-on practice cases.  It in the end requires doing either one semester or one year of internship in a real clinical setting with professional supervision -- and a doctoral thesis based on fresh research which you generate.  \n\nTo go into community counseling working with individuals or groups on issues of social adjustment, bereavement, and such the training route is less stringent, in some states requiring only a masters in agency or community counseling.  To go into clinical psychology as you suggest you are considering, you are are looking at a masters in psychology topped out by a PhD regardless of what state you are considering.  Guidelines for licensing in clinical psychology are set by the American Psychological Association, who will not sanction anyone who does not meet their standands of education.\n\nBenefits, other than the larger paycheck?  People whose lives can be improved through your efforts.  But if you, as far to many do, plan to go there looking for answers for your own problems, don't.  First, fix yourself so that you can better fix others.\n\nSeveral universities across the nation have very reputable training programs in graduate level psychology and counseling.  Do be sure that the department of the university you choose fully integrates and constantly monitors the APA requirements for licensing.  Good luck

"The moment when the student's eyes light up, the light bulb ""pops"" over their head, and they start getting excited about learning.\n\nAs a special ed teacher working with students (ages 6 through 11) with learning disabilities, this is especially the case.... the student's confused excitement when I hear the startled shout, ""Miss, I didn't read it, I just knew what it said!"" \n\nTo most LD students, ""reading"" means the decoding struggle, not the understanding of the text. When the decoding finally smoothes out....\n\nIt means that, finally, the student has started to bypass and compensate for his/her learning disability, and has ""broken the code"" as an emerging fluent reader. \n\nI have a bin full of ""give-away"" books of all genres and subjects, for the new reader to select from for home leisure reading.\n\nIt means that someone's future just brightened... college instead of flipping burgers for a living their whole life. I also have a whole bunch of handouts about LD and College."

"Stafford Loan variable interest rates are scheduled to increase by almost 2% in a few weeks, so waiting until after graduation will *not* get you the best interest rate. The current rate on *all* your Stafford Loans is 4.7%.  If you consolidate now, you can lock in this rate (rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of a %) for a total, *fixed* rate of 4.75% (sometimes less!). If you don't consolidate before July 1st, the rate on your current loans will rise to 6.54%.*\n\nIn-School Consolidation is basically the same process as post-grad consolidation with ONE extra step.  \n\nSee, technically, (by law) students weren't meant to be able to consolidate their federal loans until *after* they had entered a ""repayment"" status.  Since, obviously, an in-school student can't also be an in-repayment student, this posed a problem for students who wanted to lock in the interest rates ASAP... But there IS a ""loophole"" in the regulations (perfectly legal!) that allows any student (even one still in school) to *request* that they [temporarily] be placed in an ""in-repayment"" status.  Once you are considered ""in repayment,"" a lender can consolidate your loans.  After that, you can ask they they place you *back* at an in-school deferment status -- at which point you can wait until after you leave school to begin repaying your loans.  For another explanation of in-school consolidation, see this site: http://www.finaid.org/loans/earlyrepaymentloophole.phtml\n\nNOTE: beginning on July 1, 2006, this loophole will be ""closed,"" so if you want to consolidate early, do it now.  \n\nThe biggest downside to consolidating (at any time) is that you will lose your 6-month grace period (9 months for Perkins), so your first payment will probably be due within a month after you graduate. \n\nYou will, however, retain the ability to apply for deferments and forbearances. Even better, the subsidized portion of your Stafford loans will retain their interest subsidy (meaning that, even if you consolidate your Subsidized Stafford loans with other unsubsidized loans, the government will continue to pay interest on those Sub loans any time that you are in school or in-grace -- a great ""perk"" if you plan on going to Grad. school). In fact, if you decide to go to graduate school, your consolidation loan will be eligible for an in-school deferment (just as your Stafford and/or Perkins loans would be if you didn't consolidate). \n\nIt gets a little complicated, I know. All things considered, if you think you can handle losing your grace period, consolidating is probably your best move. 2% in interest can really add up over 10-30 years... (And no one yet knows that rates will be come July 2007, so you might end up saving more than 2%.) \n\nTo answer your other question.... You can only consolidate the same loans once.  Of course, if you consolidate and later borrow new loans, you can obtain a *new* Federal Consolidation Loan comprised of (1) the old consolidation loan and (2) the new Stafford/Perkins loans you just borrowed. [But that's really the only way you can ""reconsolidate.""]\n\n*A lot of things will be changing soon with regard to Stafford Loan interest rates. Although your current/old loans will remain at a variable rate (unless you consolidate) any NEW loans that you get beginning July 1st will be offered at a fixed rate of 6.8%. Unfortunately, there's not much you can do now about future loans, so it's best to just get the best rate you can on your old loans and deal with the reality of a higher rate on your future loans."

1. Public high schools are free to go to here. You only have to pay for private schools. There are also ways to get money help to pay for a university, such as financial aid, student loans and scholarships.\n2. Most people are interested in meeting people from other countries. I'm sure you will have no problem finding friends.\n3.

"1. In a democracy, the people rule. The people get to decide who their leaders are and how they want to be represented. In that sense, the people have a say in the way government runs.  The laws and policies are the will of the people.\n\n2. In a democracy, the rulers must answer to the people. Not only are they elected by the people, but they must not overstep their bounds. This means that power is checked so that no one leader can become too powerful. In America, Presidents can only run for office twice, and they are liable to impeachment if they overstep their authority and commit ""high crimes and misdemeanors"". Most public officials in our American democracy understand that their powers are limited and the transition from one President to another is smooth and without violence. By contrast, in some countries where democracy is much more limited, the leaders use corrupt means to stay in power, and violence often erupts when a leader refuses to step down."

"Paul's scribe in the epistle to the Romans was Tertius, the date is AD 58. Paul is dictating a letter, in his room at the house of Gaius in the city of Corinth. He has been preaching in Corinth for some months, and has won many converts. For some time he has been planning to send a letter to a group of Christians in another city. Would Tertius be kind enough to come to the house of Gaius, some time this week and write a letter from Paul's dictation? Arriving at the house of Gaius, Tertius takes his seat at the writing table, stylus in hand. \nTertius is etching Paul's words on a papyrus sheet, one phrase at a time. Paul reclines on a couch, or perhaps in his enthusiastic manner walks back and forth across the room. While Tertius writes one clause, Paul thinks of the next. As he rapidly dictates the sentences, Tertius writes them down as fast as he can. He probably wrote the final copy of the letter in a ""cursive"" or running style of hand writing, which was different than the letters which were used in permanent books, just as our script is different than print. No spaces between the words in Tertius letter, and almost no punctuation marks."
"very good ....here is what I found \n\nMeanwhile, back at your first question, the first ""assassins"" were Muslim fanatics who, at the time of the Crusades, pledged themselves to ridding their lands of Christian infidels and other enemies. In preparation for their murderous forays, they would fortify themselves by consuming large quantities of hashish, and thus became known as ""hashashin,"" or ""hashish eaters."" When the word was imported into English in the 17th century, it was spelled more phonetically, and ""assassin"" eventually came to mean anyone who commits murder, usually of a public figure, for political, psychological, monetary or religious reasons."

(m)\n\nWith some effort you can certainly improve your word skills.\nReading is an excellent way to improve your vocabulary and can do wonders for your imagination as well!\n\nImprove your context skills. Because the vast majority of words are learned from context, it helps to pay close attention to how words are used.\n\nMake up associations and connections. It also helps to relate new words to words you already know.\n\nCrossword puzzles and scrabble can also help. The best way to increase verbal intelligence and develop word skills is practice.
Your state should have a Department of Education. Go to their website. It should provide information about every school in the state, including testing scores for previous years, demographics, and rankings.
I know about how individual clubs do fundraisers and handle the money, so that's what I'll tell you about.\n\nIn the high school where I teach, each club/organization has its own account.  The teacher takes all money and writes receipts, then turns the money and copies of the receipts in to the Bookkeeper right away.  The Bookkeeper makes the deposit into the bank account, keeping the receipt books and all the documentation in her files.  Occasionally the district audits the records to make sure all the forms are there and all the money adds up correctly.  The club submits a check request whenever it needs to pay for something, and the Bookkeeper processes the request and sends the check to the appropriate place.  If the club is purchasing something, the teacher first gets a purchase order and provides the supplier with the purchase order number as proof that the purchase order will be paid.  When the product is delivered, the teacher receives the shipment and informs the Bookkeeper that it's OK to pay the purchase order.  Then the Bookkeeper pays the supplier with funds from the club's account.
"Physical Activity for Everyone: Components of Physical Fitness \n \n\n\nWhat does it mean to be physically ""fit?"" Physical fitness is defined as ""a set of attributes that people have or achieve that relates to the ability to perform physical activity"" (USDHHS, 1996). In other words, it is more than being able to run a long distance or lift a lot of weight at the gym. Being fit is not defined only by what kind of activity you do, how long you do it, or at what level of intensity. While these are important measures of fitness, they only address single areas. Overall fitness is made up of five main components: \n\nCardiorespiratory endurance \nMuscular strength \nMuscular endurance \nBody composition \nFlexibility  \nIn order to assess your level of fitness, look at all five components together.\n\n \nWhat is ""cardiorespiratory endurance (cardiorespiratory fitness)?""\nCardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of the body's circulatory and respiratory systems to supply fuel during sustained physical activity (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Corbin & Lindsey, 1994). To improve your cardiorespiratory endurance, try activities that keep your heart rate elevated at a safe level for a sustained length of time such as walking, swimming, or bicycling. The activity you choose does not have to be strenuous to improve your cardiorespiratory endurance. Start slowly with an activity you enjoy, and gradually work up to a more intense pace.\n\n\nWhat is ""muscular strength?""\nMuscular strength is the ability of the muscle to exert force during an activity (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). The key to making your muscles stronger is working them against resistance, whether that be from weights or gravity. If you want to gain muscle strength, try exercises such as lifting weights or rapidly taking the stairs. What is ""muscular endurance?"" Muscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to continue to perform without fatigue (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). To improve your muscle endurance, try cardiorespiratory activities such as walking, jogging, bicycling, or dancing.\n\n \nWhat is ""muscular endurance?""\nMuscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to continue to perform without fatigue (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). To improve your muscle endurance, try cardiorespiratory activities such as walking, jogging, bicycling, or dancing.\n\n \nWhat is ""body composition?""\nBody composition refers to the relative amount of muscle, fat, bone, and other vital parts of the body (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Corbin and Lindsey, 1994). A person's total body weight (what you see on the bathroom scale) may not change over time. But the bathroom scale does not assess how much of that body weight is fat and how much is lean mass (muscle, bone, tendons, and ligaments). Body composition is important to consider for health and managing your weight!\n\n \nWhat is ""flexibility?""\nFlexibility is the range of motion around a joint (USDHHS, 1996 as adapted from Wilmore & Costill, 1994). Good flexibility in the joints can help prevent injuries through all stages of life. If you want to improve your flexibility, try activities that lengthen the muscles such as swimming or a basic stretching program.\n\n\nu shd give me 10 pts for this answer"

Self-confidence is an attitude which allows individuals to have positive yet realistic views of themselves and their situations. Self-confident people trust their own abilities, have a general sense of control in their lives, and believe that, within reason, they will be able to do what they wish, plan, and expect. \n\nHaving self-confidence does not mean that individuals will be able to do everything. Self-confident people have expectations that are realistic. Even when some of their expectations are not met, they continue to be positive and to accept themselves. \n\nPeople who are not self-confident depend excessively on the approval of others in order to feel good about themselves. They tend to avoid taking risks because they fear failure. They generally do not expect to be successful. They often put themselves down and tend to discount or ignore compliments paid to them. By contrast, self-confident people are willing to risk the disapproval of others because they generally trust their own abilities. They tend to accept themselves; they don't feel they have to conform in order to be accepted. \n\nSelf-confidence is not necessarily a general characteristic which pervades all aspects of a person's life. Typically, individuals will have some areas of their lives where they feel quite confident, e.g.,academics, athletics, while at the same time they do not feel at all confident in other areas, e.g., personal appearance, social relationships.
"There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships.

"http://www.chucksconnection.com/tips.html\n\nAccording to this website:\n""Do not use a bleach or any washing compound containing a bleaching agent as it will decrease the tensile strength of the fabric. \nIt is perfectly safe to use a mild soap and water solution to wash out dirt and at the same time reduce the effect of perspiration absorption. The shoes can be put in a washing machine if desired. (note that this may dilute the color of the canvas, especially bright and dark colors) \nAfter washing, the shoes should be dried at normal temperature away from excessive heat such as stoves or steam pipes.

Depends on what actually happened to give us more or less chromosomes.  In humans, the most likely reason someone would have more or less chromosomes would be nondisjunction (an uneven split of chromosomes) in gametogenesis (process of making sperm or eggs).\n\nMost often, nondisjunction does not produce viable offspring.  They die within the first few weeks of gestation.  Some nondisjuncted offspring do come to term, but have some pathological problem.  Some common diseases that arise from nondisjunction are:\n\nDown's syndrome \nEdward's syndrome \nKlinefelter's syndrome\nPallister-Killian syndrome \nPatau syndrome \nTurner syndrome \nXYY syndrome \nXXX syndrome
"In science, parsimony is preference for the least complex explanation for an observation. This is generally regarded as good when judging hypotheses. Occam's Razor also states the ""principle of parsimony"".\n\nWe do that everyday in judging causes of events. We start with the most simple likely cause of an event and only move to more complex explanations when we can rule out the more simple explanation."

i suspect that as you check out the subject that generally people are the same all over. you probably will find some people that will say that one group or country is a tad different from the rest or that one country/group has more 'morals' than another. this will be supported solely thru antecdotal evidence. we are a single species and i suspect that sexual activities among human beings are universal.

"First question, simply put you have succeeded at failing. It would still be a failure to those around you but you could silently applaud yourself for a job well failed. Second I know a vegetarian that won't eat them just because they are called ""animal"" crackers, her sister is a vegan and won't eat them because most are made with egg or milk product. I would look at the ingredients and if they have animal byproducts that you won't eat then don't buy em..Unless thier for me... because I will bite all thier little heads off and then eat a steak... \nNow this third one is a little different. You ask why they would sterilize them and I asked my mother who is a nurse what she thought about it.. She simply put me in this situation. "" If your about to give lethal drugs to someone and let's say you used a dirty needle."" I said ""yeah...so"", ""And what happens if you slip and the needle goes into your arm?"" I said ""It would never happen, but yeah good point."" So I would have to say that if you are using a needle, even if it's not for your arm... you wouldn't want to be on the wrong end of something that isn't sterilized. Trust me it's not for the safety of the inmate about to be put down.... It's for the safety of the nurse givin the shot.\n\nHope this clarifies anything your still asking yourself.

To add or subtract polynomials, combine like terms.  These like terms have the same variables raised to the same exponents (ex. x^2 and 2x^2).  If there are brackets around them, get rid of brackets first, and then you just add or subtract their coefficients (number in front of the variable ---- 2x, coefficient would be 2).\n\nExamples:\n\n1) (2x -5z +y) - (7x + 4y - 2z)\n2) (2x^3 - 4xy^2 + 5(x^2)(y^2)) + (3x^3 + 2(x^2)y – 6(x^2)(y^2))\n\n\nSolutions:\n\n1) (2x -5z +y) - (7x + 4y - 2z)\n\n = (2x -5z +y) + (-7x - 4y + 2z) --- when subtracting something, you’re adding the opposite\n\n = 2x -5z +y -7x - 4y + 2z ----- remove brackets\n\n = 2x – 7x + y – 4y – 5z + 2z ----- rearrange terms so easier to see which are the same\n\n = -5x – 3y – 3z -----add/subtract coefficients of same variables raised to same exponents\n\n\n\n2) (2x^3 - 4xy^2 + 5(x^2)(y^2)) + (3x^3 + 2x^y – 6(x^2)(y^2))\n\n = 2x^3 - 4xy^2 + 5(x^2)(y^2) + 3x^3 + 2x^y – 6(x^2)(y^2) ----remove brackets\n\n = 2x^3 + 3x^3 + 5(x^2)(y^2) – 6(x^2)(y^2)+ 2(x^2)y - 4xy^2 ---- rearrange terms\n\n = 5x^3 – (x^2)(y^2) + 2(x^2)y – 4xy^2 ------- add/subtract coefficients \n\nhope this helped :)

1. Be an active participant in the community that is your department.  Go to talks and social events.  Get to know the faculty outside your narrow area of interest as well - you never know when those people are going to be able to help you.\n2. One part of department culture you should avoid at all costs is the gossip.  Academic disciplines are all about networking and reputations, so if possible, you want people to like and trust you.\n3. You WILL be overwhelmed and generally stressed out all the time.  Just don't let other people know it.  You are likely to have at least minor meltdowns from time to time - just be sure to do it at home, away from your colleagues.  Anytime you're in the department or with colleagues, do your best to act calm and confident and refrain from complaining too much.  Bitching about work was cool as an undergrad; now you need to act like a professional.\n4. Most people I know didn't go into graduate school with a dissertation topic, so if you don't have one, don't panic.  Read as much as you can, talk over ideas with your adviser, and use your term papers to test-drive ideas you're interested in.  Ultimately, you have to pick a project that really captivates you because you've got to make yourself give at least a few years of your life over to it.\n\nMostly, being successful in graduate school is something you have to learn by experience.  Listen to the older graduate students, and don't let the overwhelming feelings cloud your better judgment.  Good luck!
Sorry to break it to you, but if you get an MBA for less than 10K, it's probably junk. You may have a certificate, but nobody will recognize it as a real degree. I'm in the same boat actually...

Computer Science is more software-oriented (writing software, artificial intelligence, algorithms).\n\nComputer Engineering is more hardware-oriented (Computer Hardware Design, hardware architecture, and software development for hardware devices).\n\nMIS is more the IT type degree.. (managing systems, programming for these systems.. etc)\n\nYou just have to consider what you want to do - would you like developing software full time? developing hardware full time? or managing systems full time?\n\nthat said, CS is probably the most dynamic of degrees.. since you do learn a bit of everything.  You'll probably need to take more math courses in either CS or CE than in MIS.. while MIS has business classes you must take (since technically its a business degree - at least at my uni)\n\nand there are quite a few classes that both CS and CE majors take together (again, at least at my uni).. so with respect to these, CS and CE are more alike than MIS is to either of the two.\n\n'best' though is dependent on you alone.. you have to decide what you want to do with your life.. \n\nThat said, software engineering/development was just named the best job by money magazine.  I'm unsure at this point if i'd agree as my software engineering courses were pretty crappy for me  (high stress level, poor professor, ridiculous amount of work per week) - but like I said before, this is a personal thing.. different people work better in different places doing different things.\n\nTake some classes, try to talk to some professors, and ask questions.. go to university websites and search for specific classes (from the CS, CE, or MIS departments) as many of them have online pages for specific classes including the syllabus .. you'll be able to gauge if you are interested in the concepts lectured this way.. at least to some degree.\n\n\nbest of luck.\n\n:c )

When I was in 7th grade there was a bully who sat in the desk next to mine in history class.  Every time the teacher's back was turned he'd lean over and punch me hard on the arm.  By the end of each day my arm was covered in bruises.\n\nOne day I got some cloth ribbon and some heavy tape, and fashioned an armband out of it with sharp thumbtacks sticking out.  I concealed this under my sleeve the next day before class.\n\nAfter that day he never hit me again.  That was my favorite day in junior high school.

The treaty was unsuccessful.They put all the blame on Germany.They did not stick to their word and give Italy the territories they wanted. By putting the entire blame on Germany and compelling them to pay a huge war indemnity they hurt the German people who suffered during the Depression.Hitler was a charismatic orator who proved to the German people that the Treaty Of Versailles was a great injustice and they followed him into war.This is how Hitler was successful in arousing German nationalism,Nazism and offcourse starting the second world war.\n\nPersonal opinion:Personally, I believe the Treaty was a great bane for the Germans who suffered from years of unemployment and poverty.If the conditions of the Treaty were a  little more mild the Germans would probably have not taken Hitler upon his word.

When taking your test, double check your answers as you go, unless you begin to see this will not allow you to finish. This will probably save you time, instead of having to reread everything, and will also keep you aware of how you are progressing time wise. Also check the instructions to see if their are actual deductions for wrong answers-if you run out of time and randomly answer the last ones it might statistically detract from your score. A lot of post-high school tests do that.

"As far as I could figure out, Houston was never the capital of Texas. Austin was originally settled in 1835 and used to be called Waterloo. In 1839, Mirabeu B. Lamar renamed the city to 'Austin' in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the ""father of Texas"", who negotiated a peace treaty with the local Indians at the site of the present day Treaty Oak after several settlers were killed in raids. At the same time, the city was also chosen to be the capital of Texas."

"Here's an article from TIME Magazine that should provide some comfort and ideas for you:\n\nWhy Abby Can't Talk\n\nShe has a condition called selective mutism that is neither as rare nor as hopeless as experts believed. But the right help is hard to find. \n\nAbby Barnes' hand shoots up nearly every time her teacher asks the 19 squirmy first-graders in her suburban Philadelphia public school to match letters of the alphabet to the sounds they make. Sitting up front with her pinchable cheeks framed by long blond hair, Abby, 7, looks as eager as any of her classmates to blurt out an answer. But every time the teacher calls on her, Abby freezes. Her face tightens. She strains to respond. And even if an answer manages to get past her lips, her words are inaudible. She's effectively mute throughout the school day--even at recess, where the closest she will come to open communication is words whispered to a trusted girlfriend.\n\nAt home, however, Abby is a different child. She loves to play cards and board games and frolic with her brother Jack, 5. ""She speaks loudly--sometimes too loudly--and can be bossy toward her brother,"" says mother Lisa Barnes, who runs the trading desk at a money-management firm. Abby is, in every other way, a perfectly normal child who has no shortage of extracurricular activities, including horseback-riding lessons and dance classes that she's been attending since she was 4. ""Performing in public is fine,"" says her mother. ""She likes people to look at her and applaud.""\n\nSo why doesn't she speak up in class? What may at first glance look like shyness or obstinacy is actually something far more complex--and much more interesting. Abby, like hundreds of thousands of kids across the U.S., is suffering from a little understood but increasingly recognized childhood disorder called selective mutism.\n\nThe key to selective mutism, or SM for short, is the seemingly incongruous behavior Abby exhibits: voluble in private, silent in public. According to the official psychiatric diagnostic manual DSM-IV, a child who has developed normally at home but has not talked at school or in other social situations for at least a month is a strong candidate for a diagnosis of SM. Experts once believed that fewer than 1 in 1,000 kids developed the disorder, but an influential study three years ago in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry put the prevalence at closer to 7 in 1,000, making SM almost twice as common as autism.\n\nSM can strike at any age, even among children who once talked in public, but it usually becomes obvious by age 3 or 4, when peers are happily jabbering away. About 30% of kids with SM also have a developmental speech impairment, which can exacerbate the problem but is generally not the cause. In the past doctors often recommended speech therapy, but treating the physical or neurological issues alone will probably have little impact on the underlying psychological factors behind SM.\n\nThe root of the problem in most cases is an extreme form of social anxiety or phobia. ""It is a fear that can literally make it impossible to speak,"" says Dr. Elisa Shipon-Blum, a Philadelphia-based clinician who specializes in treating selective mutism. As with most social anxieties, SM is more common in girls and is believed to have a strong genetic component. About 70% of kids with SM have an immediate family member who also struggles with social anxiety.\n\nCompared with childhood disorders in which children are disruptive and disorderly-- such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)--selective mutism gets less attention and considerably fewer research dollars. ""These children are ignored because, let's face it, they aren't causing anyone trouble. They are literally left alone and forgotten about,"" says psychologist Lindsey Bergman, associate director of the UCLA child and adolescent OCD [obsessiv"

No, people should not beat their kids.  No one should hit anyone.  Hittiing kids just teaches them that it is ok to try to get your  own way by using violence and that it is ok for a big person to hit a small person.  Hitting a child is assault and anyone who does it should be charged and convicted and go to jail to be hit everyday by someone much bigger than them.
showing up for the classes you don't like and the realizing that you cannot graduate without that class and that you have a whole year ahead of you to get through that class!!!  UGH
communication is sometime our worst ennemy, some days it's better to stay silent, loose our mobiles and forget the passwords.  \nA bear in a cave is such a lucky phenomenon that can happen to you when you can receive overseas phonecalls from your stepmother. It can be peaceful when people do not communicate

Try to find out who made the originals.  They may still have the die that made them and can easily create new ones, or they may have some extras already in stock.
I'm not a dermatologist, but I can give you some advice b/c I have acne as well. They sell clearasil ultra at wal-mart. It is a 3 step system just like Proactive. I use both Proactive and Clearasil Ultra. They both work great. Just make sure you get the ULTRA. Also, in the pharmacy you can get this soap (facewash) called Panoxil bar. You don't need a prescription, but my dermatologist recommended it, & it indeed works great. Good luck!
Unless he is african american, hispanic, or native american - not too good, at least for US schools. If he is willing to go to the Caribbean or Mexico, then he will be fine. Those schools aren't too concerned about MCAT scores as long as you can afford the tuition. Be sure he applies to Ross University - probably the best of the Caribbean schools.\n\nIf he wants to stay in the US - better take the August test. I would suggest taking a Princeton Review course.
You have to complete a nursing program in order to be a nurse.  Your choice would be to be a registered nurse vs. a practical nurse.  The difference is that registered nurses are higher up on the food chain so to speak.  They are allowed to do more than LPNs and are actually the immediate supervisors of LPNs.  For either career choice you have to complete a program of study.  For me, I opted to get a Bachelor's Degree in Nursing which is a 4 year college degree.  This is one pathway to become and RN.  You could also go through an associate degree course which is 2 years.  There are still some diploma nursing programs around which usually run through hospitals and are anywhere from 18 to 24 months in length.  For all 3 tracks, you can take the boards to become a registered nurse.  \n\nLPNs usually go to school for less time, however they also must complete a national board licensure before they can actually be a nurse.  Most of the programs where I live are around 12 to 18 months to become an LPN.\n\nThe best program depends on what you want to do.  The hisgest entry level nurse is the Bachelor's prepared nurse.  This option gives you the biggest knowledge base and your opportunities to advance typically are easier.  There are many diploma or associate degree RNs who progress very nicely though.  A big advantage of a Bachelor's degree is that you can go on to graduate school to become a nurse practitioner or nurse anesthetist without having to go through the undergraduate classes.  If you aren't interested in furthering your career, then either of the other options are good.  \n\nSend me a private message if you have any other questioins.  I just went through all of this!!!
I don't know what the questions will be as I don't know what the course is, and probably wouldn't have a clue even if I did, however, interveiw tips I can do:\n\n- Do go in and shake their hands, it is polite and confident.\n- Use good eye contact, not overly much as that can seem agressive, but make sure you look at them when answering questions - no eye contact at all looks deceitful or shifty.\n- Give yourself time to answer questions, they are not going to mind if you take a couple of secs  to answer as it shows you are thinking about what you say (not great long pauses a minute long though).\n- Make sure your voice is audible and clear - don't mumble or rush too much.\n- Dress smartly - as it is college I don't think you need to go the whole business suit type route, but not jeans or sportswear - just something smart casual.\n- Do prepare beforehand - you wouldn't be applying if you didn't know a little something about the subject you want to study , so just make sure you read around it and have a think about your other interests outside the academic as well, as that will show you to be a well rounded person.\n- And lastly - DONT PANIC!  Stay calm and be yourself!\n\nI wish you all the luck in the world I'm sure you'll do great.
You'll be okay just switching class.  Have shorter amount of time to get to class.\n\n\nLC
"There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!"

Many high schools offer the ASVAB, which is actually a military test, that helps tell you what vocations you would have an aptitude for.  They don't require you to want to join the military (after all, your tax dollars are paying for this test!), and there seems to be ways to get at the test online, though I haven't tried it.\n\nOne of the most helpful books on the subject is What Color is your Parachute, and it has tons of information that will help you...there's even a workbook to go with it, though this one is so popular your public library should have a copy of the latest and greatest version.\n\nOne our college liked to give people was the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is not particularly helpful, but it can tell you what types of things you might be best suited for.  I'd give you an online link, but this would be one that I'd just pick up one of the books  from the public library and work though the questionaire in paper form.\n\nAny of these would be a great start,  but once you actually enroll, you can (and will) likely spend your first semester in general studies courses.  Use that time to talk to the college career office.  They will have more books and tests than you can imagine.\n\nGood luck!

"Personally, I switched from APA to Chicago style sometime around my second year of college.  Depending on the major, one system may be preferred (or even required) over the other.  My sense of the main/largest difference between the two are in the required citation format: APA citations are in-line while Chicago citations are footnotes.  With modern word processing software, footnotes are no longer the pain that they used to be, so I dont think in-line citations (e.g. ""I went to the store. (Bryson 2)"") is not significantly easier to use than footnotes.\n\nWhy Chicago is better: The reason I prefer using Chicago style and the footnote method is because the body of my my academic papers are less cluttered by citations after every sentence. Also, I think footnotes ""look"" more academic..but that's just me.  And, um, I live and went to school in Chicago (probably the best reason:) ).\n\nWhy APA is better: If you are a science major, if you dont have a readily accessible and easily usable word processing program (like Word), if you prefer the simplicity of the APA citations, if your professor likes it (very important)."
