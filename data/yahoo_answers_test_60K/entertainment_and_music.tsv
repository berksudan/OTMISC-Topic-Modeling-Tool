Wide release is expected to start on January 6 with a plan to be at more than 300 theaters by Jan. 27, right before the Academy Award nominations are announced.\nIt could be pushed to earlier dates depending on the response of the Platform Releases and of course, making sure it doesn't clash with a big studio blockbuster release either.

"Snopes - the Urban Legend Archive - is a wealth of information on these things. Here's what they have to say:\n\n""The figure behind the curtains is a ""standee"" (a stand-up cardboard cutout used for advertising displays) of Ted Danson, dressed in a top hat, white shirt, and tails. The standee prop was created as part of a story line involving a dog food commercial in which Danson's character (an actor) appears, but references to the figure were cut from the finished version of the film.""\n\n""(The standee shows up once more in the film: Ted Danson is standing next to it when the baby's mother comes to reclaim her child.) The figure was accidentally left in front of a window on the set by a propman and thereby ""sneaked"" into the background of one scene. Additionally, all indoor scenes were shot on a Toronto soundstage -- no real structures were used for interior filming."""

I think you may have something confused in your question.  Washtenaw Community College has station 95.9 in Ann Arbor, MI, but it's called WCC Orchard, and is primarily an Internet radio station.

The Eclectic Pop of Escape Pod\n \nESCAPE POD: Losing Control (7-inch Single on Dead Digital)\n\nThis single from 2003 offers an all too-brief dose of eclectic pop.\n\nCombining raw electronics and low-fi folk sensibilities, Escape Pod generates a sound that is haunting but reassuring. The minimal electronics are finely restrained to the point where the sparseness creates a lusher sound than the components, a flow expertly embellished by the vocal harmonies that describe unrequited wishes. Sedate drums and gentle guitar flesh out the compositions, delivering the ethereal sound into more accessible territory.\n\nComparable to the Pixies and Beck, Escape Pod's music provides a serene access to tuneage of less demanding quality, providing sonic refuge among airwaves overcrowded with harsh noise.

"Following a 2000 lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund (also WWF), the Federation changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment, or WWE. Its parent company, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, also chose to adopt this name. The lawsuit dealt with the wrestling company's breaching of an agreement with the Fund over use of the initials ""WWF"" in the United Kingdom. Rather than attempt a financial settlement with the Fund, McMahon changed the name of the company. The logo was altered, and a promotional campaign called ""Get The F Out"" was used to publicize this change. Also, all verbal and visual references to ""WWF"" and the World Wrestling Federation logo from the ""Attitude"" era were edited out from old broadcasts. Some observers saw the new name as further acknowledgement by the company on its emphasis towards the entertainment rather than athletic aspects of professional wrestling."

Yes it was Abbot and Cosstello\n\nAbbott: Well Costello, I'm going to New York with you. You know Bucky Harris, the Yankee's manager, gave me a job as coach for as long as you're on the team.\n\nCostello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players.\n\nAbbott: I certainly do.\n\nCostello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team.\n\nAbbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names.\n\nCostello: You mean funny names?\n\nAbbott: Strange names, pet names...like Dizzy Dean...\n\nCostello: His brother Daffy.\n\nAbbott: Daffy Dean...\n\nCostello: And their French cousin.\n\nAbbott: French?\n\nCostello: Goofè.\n\nAbbott: Goofè Dean. Well, let's see, we have on the bags, Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know is on third...\n\nCostello: That's what I want to find out.\n\nAbbott: I say Who's on first, What's on second, I Don't Know's on third.\n\nCostello: Are you the manager?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nCostello: You gonna be the coach too?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nCostello: And you don't know the fellows' names?\n\nAbbott: Well I should.\n\nCostello: Well then who's on first?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nCostello: I mean the fellow's name.\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: The guy on first.\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: The first baseman.\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: The guy playing...\n\nAbbott: Who is on first!\n\nCostello: I'm asking YOU who's on first.\n\nAbbott: That's the man's name.\n\nCostello: That's who's name?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nCostello: Well go ahead and tell me.\n\nAbbott: That's it.\n\nCostello: That's who?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nPAUSE\n\nCostello: Look, you gotta first baseman?\n\nAbbott: Certainly.\n\nCostello: Who's playing first?\n\nAbbott: That's right.\n\nCostello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?\n\nAbbott: Every dollar of it.\n\nCostello: All I'm trying to find out is the fellow's name on first base.\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: The guy that gets...\n\nAbbott: That's it.\n\nCostello: Who gets the money...\n\nAbbott: He does, every dollar. Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.\n\nCostello: Whose wife?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nPAUSE\n\nAbbott: What's wrong with that?\n\nCostello: Look, all I wanna know is when you sign up the first baseman, how does he sign his name?\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: The guy.\n\nAbbott: Who.\n\nCostello: How does he sign...\n\nAbbott: That's how he signs it.\n\nCostello: Who?\n\nAbbott: Yes.\n\nPAUSE\n\nCostello: All I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.\n\nAbbott: No. What is on second base.\n\nCostello: I'm not asking you who's on second.\n\nAbbott: Who's on first.\n\nCostello: One base at a time!\n\nAbbott: Well, don't change the players around.\n\nCostello: I'm not changing nobody!\n\nAbbott: Take it easy, buddy.\n\nCostello: I'm only asking you, who's the guy on first base?\n\nAbbott: That's right.\n\nCostello: Ok.\n\nAbbott: All right.\n\nPAUSE\n\nCostello: What's the guy's name on first base?\n\nAbbott: No. What is on second.\n\nCostello: I'm not asking you who's on second.\n\nAbbott: Who's on first.\n\nCostello: I don't know.\n\nAbbott: He's on third, we're not talking about him.\n\nCostello: Now how did I get on third base?\n\nAbbott: Why you mentioned his name.\n\nCostello: If I mentioned the third baseman's name, who did I say is playing third?\n\nAbbott: No. Who's playing first.\n\nCostello: What's on first?\n\nAbbott: What's on second.\n\nCostello: I don't know.\n\nAbbott: He's on third.\n\nCostello: There I go, back on third again!\n\nPAUSE\n\nCostello: Would you just stay on third base and don't go off it.\n

What you want to do is ask your service Provider if they host an internet service for your model of phone. If yes, be sure to ask what features are included so that you don't needlessly spend money. If no, ask if you can upgrade to a phone that is capable of the features you are looking for. It may be free, it may not.

"The last 15 years? Well, that would either be Michael Jackson or Madonna. Both created their own unique sound and had many other artists in the past several years come out and try to be like them. For Michael, that would be Usher, Justin Timberlake, and the like. For Madonna that would be Britney Spears, Christina Aguiliera and the like. They were both massive pop icons in the 80's and 90's. While Michael has lost most of his American following due to his legal issues, he is still one of the top recording artists in European and Asian countries. Madonna, on the other hand, continues to re-invent herself with each new album. This is shown in her most recent release of ""Confessions on a Dance Floor"". She's physically in the best shape she's been in for several years and her sound still makes people get up and move."

"I-tunes under ""deeper cuts"""
Swan Lake (Russian: Лебединое Озеро) is one of the most famous and critically-acclaimed ballets, with music by Tchaikovsky.\n\nThe original ballet was first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia on February 20, 1877 and remained in the repertoire until 1883. After Tchaikovsky's death, the ballet was revised by his brother Modest and the conductor Riccardo Drigo. This revised version received its premiere at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg on January 15, 1895 with choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, and many later stagings have followed their work more or less closely.\n\nA single dancer dances the twin roles of Odette and Odile, which is one of the most taxing of all roles because it requires acting two entirely contrasting characters, as well as the strenuous showpiece dancing itself, including thirty-two fouettés. This feat was put into the choreography because it was a party piece of Pierina Legnani, first prima ballerina assoluta of the Maryinsky ballet. Pavel Gerdt played Prince Siegfried.\n\nThe ballet's premiere in St. Petersburg was very poorly received. It had lackluster costumes and scenery, unusual choreography, and a mediocre orchestra. It also departed from the traditional Russian format of ballet, which used a story with just enough plot to sustain the virtuoso dancing; Tchaikovsky's ballet, on the other hand, included a well-unified storyline which lost much of the audience. A later revival in the year after Tchaikovsky's death was acclaimed as a masterpiece, however, having used phenomenal talent in all aspects.

Some people think characters in anime/manga are hot because they are ideal. Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga. Unfortunatly this isn't good because if we only look to our dream guy/girl we will miss out on meeting a great guy/girl in real life. I personally crush on anime/manga characters but I don't let that close my eyes to the real life guy/girls around me. I use thoses crushes to write fanfics.

The last time I sang to myself was this afternoon in my car, on my way home from the dentist. I was trying to see how I sounded with my new teeth! The last time I sang to someone?

"Superman is slightly more powerful than Wonder Woman.  It has been said in Wizard, the official guide to all things comics, comparing all the heroes in all the universes (well, comic universe, that is) that Wonder Woman is ranked #4 in terms of power/physical prowess and abilities.  Superman is ranked #3.  Thor of Marvel, and Silver Surfer of the same, are ranked #2 and #1, respectively.  \n\nNot only that, but Supes has been ""killed"" numerous times only to be brought back from the dead.\n\nHowever, Wonder Woman has been eliminated a few times (granted, they were in ALTERNATE universes and thus, are not canonical to the storylines of W.W.!)  and brought back to life by the gods, mainly because Wonder Woman is RELATED to the gods!"

"It depends if you are playing solo or with a piano accompaniment. If you are playing solo, you would use a tuning fork (440 Hz)to tune your ""A"" string. Then, you would use your ""A"" string as a reference to tune the other strings. The strings on a violin are ""G"" ""D"" ""A"" and ""E"". Basically, the pitch of the strings is in ascending fifth. You want to try to tune to a perfect fifth: ie. ""G and D"" ""D and A"" and ""A and E"". \n\nWith a piano accompaniment, you tune to the A above the middle C on the piano. And use that as your reference."
"In the late part of the 18th century and early part of the 19th century attempts were made to make both the trumpet and bugle into chromatic instruments.  One such attempt was the slide trumpet.  Some historians attribute the invention to England.  A French version appears around 1840.  A description of the instrument follows:\n\n""It was basically the natural trumpet of its period except that the bend joining the middle pipe and the bellpipe was made in the form of a U-slide which could be pushed out towards the player by means of a rod with a touch-piece lying under the second and third fingers of the right hand and automatically closed again by a spring.""\nAnother early attempt was the keyed trumpet and keyed bugle. The keyed trumpet is about 40 centimeters long and is held in a horizontal plane. The best way to think of these instruments is as almost a hybrid of a saxophone and a natural trumpet.  There are a number of keys (between five and nine) placed around the instrument and the pitch is raised or lowered by opening any combination.  The tone is produced with a metal mouthpiece as with any other brass horn.  Both Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) and Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) wrote concertos for the keyed trumpet and their works were the hallmarks of the literature for the trumpet.  The invention of the keyed trumpet is attributed to Anton Weidinger of Vienna in 1801.  Weidinger was a court trumpeter who was employed as a military trumpeter and theater musician, for whom Haydn wrote his concerto.\nThe keyed bugle was essentially the same as the keyed trumpet but with the bugle's distinctive conical shape.  The keyed bugle was made originally in England and became known to the public through the works of Richard Willis (17?-1830), an arranger, composer and performer.  The first patent was made by Joseph Halliday (dates unknown) in 1811.  Halliday named his new instrument the Royal Kent bugle in honor of the Duke of Kent.  His patent called for five keys and the instrument made its way to the United States with Willis when he was appointed bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point, New York.\nTwo performers on the keyed bugle worth mentioning are Francis Johnson (1792-1844) and Edward (Ned) Kendall (1808-1861).  Johnson was a talented black bandleader who played many instruments including the keyed bugle.  He also composed music for his band which played for parades, military drills, and balls in Philadelphia.  One of his compositions was The Bugle Quickstep, no doubt written with the instrument in mind.  The most important keyed bugle performer in the United States was Ned Kendall.  He started performing on the instrument around 1830, continuing the work begun by Willis.  Kendall perfected greater skill in playing and helped spread the popularity of the keyed bugle.  His solo skills were in high demand and he performed widely with a leading vocalist of the time, Miss Anna Stone.  Another performer on the keyed bugle was the bugler at West Point, Louis Benz, who was the post bugler for forty years from 1830-1870.  Photographs survive of Benz with keyed bugles.\n  \n \n Around the 1840s, while the keyed bugle was still popular, the development of valved brass instruments began to appear in the United States. This was the next step in making the trumpet and bugle chromatic instruments, and the development is highlighted in the story of the virtuoso instrumental piece called Wood Up Quickstep, composed in 1835 by John Holloway (dates unknown).  Many tales of the origin of the piece exist but according to Holloway it came to him while walking on the Common in Boston.  The piece became closely associated with Ned Kendall.  Despite the invention of the valved cornet, Kendall continued to play the keyed bugle all his life.  He took part in a famous contest with himself on the keyed bugle, playing against Patrick Gilmore on the valved cornet in December of 1856 in Salem, MA.  The cont"

"I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an ""authentic"" rock and roll band.  When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.  And they are a really good live act.  Of course this is all my opinion.  But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself."

Thailand is largely tropical, so it's hot and humid all year around with temperatures in the 28-35°C range, a degree of relief provided only in the mountains in the far north of Thailand. The careful observer will, however, note three seasons:\n\n    * Cool: From November to the end of February, it doesn't rain much and temperatures are at their lowest, although you will barely notice the difference in the south and will only need to pack a sweater if hiking in the northern mountains, where temperatures can fall as low as 5°C. This is the most popular time to visit and, especially around Christmas and New Year's, finding flights and accommodation can be expensive and difficult. \n\n    * Hot: From March to June, Thailand swelters in temperatures as high as 40°C. Quite nice when sitting on the beach with a coconut in hand, but not the best time of year to go temple-tramping in Bangkok. \n\n    * Rainy: From July to October, although it only really gets underway in September, tropical monsoons hit most of the country. This doesn't mean it rains non-stop, but when it does it pours and flooding is not uncommon. \n\nNote that there are local deviations to these general patterns. In particular, the south-east coast of Thailand (including Ko Samui) has the rains reversed, with the peak season being May-October and the rainy off season in November-February. \n\nDecide :D and rate me best answer

Rappers don't get paid jack.  If they can't cover more than what they can for the help, they get little to nothing.  That's just because 85% of those guys have little to no common sense, think ebonics is a primary language, and probably are just dropouts.  In life and school.  Prime example: 50 Cent was a hoodlum before he became a rapper.  Thing is, he's a great businessman so props to that jigga.

"John strikes me as a very serious musician who wants to stretch out creatively.  I don't know the man, but I would guess ""career move"" isn't a phrase in his vocablulary.

He says, ""I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me five dollars, and vice versa.""\n\nAgain, he declines and tries to get some sleep.\n\nThe American, now agitated, says, ""Okay, if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5,and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.""\n\nThis catches the Sardarji's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment, agrees to the game.\n\nThe American asks the first question: ""What's the distance from the earth to the moon?""\n\nThe Sardarji doesn't say a word, reaches into his wallet,pulls out a $5.00 bill, and hands it to the American.\n\n""Okay,"" says the American, ""your turn"".\n\nHe asks, ""What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?""\n\nThe American, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer & searches all his preferences........no answer.

"Clearly, Sidious takes out Obi Wan (he's good...but not ready for the emperor was he). Anakin, certainly is no match for Yoda either and I think he would be to twisted for even Yoda to bring him back by now. \n\nSidious must now take on a new apprentice, but he still succeeds in creating the Empire, although weaker without the power of Vader to help him. Obi Wan isn't able to deliver Luke or watch over him, or influence him to join the rebellion. Yoda still has him transported to ""his family"" and after Owen and Veru are slain he joins the Academy to become a gifted pilot in the rebellion. \n\nHan is never employed by Ben to fly to Alderan, and Leia is executed by General Tarken as planned, prior to the rescue. \n\nR2D2's plans never make it to the rebellion and they are ultimately destroyed. Luke is captured by the Emperor once he realizes someone that strong in the force exists. Luke, without the influence of Ben and Yoda, is easily converted and trained in the Dark Side from scratch (probably killing off the interim apprentice). \n\nThe Sith rule for 1000 years."

Because when it came out, there was nothing new and fresh that got children involved more in wanting to read and it filled that gap. It engages kids into using their imaginations more. It takes adults back to their younger years with the fantasy of it all. It's a good series that keeps growing and developing. Even though we've know from the begining that there would be only 7 books and ultimately a showdown between Harry & Voldemort, it's still interesting to see the unexpected twists and turns on the way to the end. It's just a GREAT series!

History was made in New York on October 6th, 1927 when the very first spoken voice in a feature film was heard.\n\nThe voice belonged to Al Jolson and the ground breaking movie – The Jazz Singer. The reaction by the theatre audience was immediate – they rose to their feet, applauding ecstatically. The moment came in the middle of the film when, during a nightclub scene, Jolson suddenly spoke.\n\n\n The first words ever spoken in a movie were, “Wait a minute, wait a minute. You ain’t heard nothin’ yet!” The words were truly prophetic in light of the massive advances taken in the realms of movie sound since that time.

Again, she looked around in vain for the culprit, but found none, so she proceeded with the day's lesson. \n\nEvery morning, for about a week, she went into the classroom and found the same word written on the board, and each day it was written in larger letters. \n\nFinally, one day, she walked in, expecting to be greeted by the same word on the board, but instead, found the words, ""The more you rub it, the bigger it gets!"" \n\n\n Gross, Grosser, Grossest   \n \n  What's grosser than gross? \nTwo vampires fighting over a bloody tampon. \nWhat's grosser than that? \nFinding a used condom on the bottom of a mayonnaise jar. \n\nWhat's grosser than that? \nWhen you open the refigerator and the rump rost farts in your face. \n\nYou want to know what's grosser than that? \nWhen you sit on your grandpa's lap and he pops a boner. \n\nBut the one thing that is grosser than that is when you are siting on your grandma's lap and she pops a boner."

who cares?
I agree with you...hes not the brightest crayon in the box.
First you must understand the notation that is being used to represent the chord.  The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary. The author of the tab should not have notated the chord this way because it is confusing. Since the /B part is not necessary you should play a regular Bsus2 chord.\n\nFor more information visit (found via Google):\nhttp://www.all-guitar-chords.com/

I think you need to book the next flight to Hollywood to pitch the idea to a major network.... I agree.
CSI's would never talk to suspects/witnesses or go into houses where they think the suspect is hiding & armed. \n\nI know more about the lab-rat types who don't go into the field at all. The cops just give them all the evidence they found and think could be useful and the analyst picks out a few things tha have the best chance of having the suspects DNA or other important evidence. There isn't time to analyze every single item left at a crime scene. You have to pick out the important things.\n\nTests take way longer to get back than on the show. The show would be ridiculously boring if they had to wait days or weeks for tests to be done.\n\nIn real life they don't really find that much evidence. This is actually becomming an issue in courts. They call it the CSI effect and it is very damaging. Jurors want to see concrete DNA evidence on everything or they think there must be some doubt. As if people have a floating cloud of DNA around them that leaves evidence on everything they touch. It just doesn't work that way.
'The 39 steps' is a book by John Buchan. Three film version have been made of it. All of the films have changed parts of the book. The 1978 film version did end in Big Ben but this is not 'the 39 steps'. Its generally regarded as the worst of the 3 films, however a fourth is in production. Big ben has more steps but this part is not currently open to the public. \n\nThe 39 steps is in a small coast town in Kent. Its a path down a cliff where you could leave / join your waiting boat.

do a yahoo! search for Classical Music Archives. there is a site that has hundreds of classical songs on it. it costs like $20.00 per year to join I think but the downloads are super-quick and there is a wide selection. there isn't any misidentification of composers/titles like you might find on limewire and you won't be able to find obscure movements of songs on limewire either.

Stephen Lynch is absurdly funny.  I would go as far to say he is my favorite comedian period.  Some of his stuff is absolutely classic, but even the weakest can draw a smile from me.  If you are well versed in history, you pick up on a lot of allusions (Thomas Jefferson, in Vanilla Ice Cream, refers to his alleged affair with a slave).  And so on.  It is too bad he isn't more well known.

That's an interesting question. Alfred Hitchcock said that the trick to a succesful suspense movie is having the audience want to warn the character not to do something, like opening a door or walking into a dark room.\nMaybe the same applies to other types of films.

i love inuyasha.  i am not too happy about how it ends.  pretty much leaves you guessing.  the show actually has a female character who isn't wearing a short skirt(kags) or low shirt(kagura) that shows what the good Lord has blessed her with.  ahem...that would be sango.  she also kicks rear end.  oh and i really miss tenchi muyoi(sp?).  it's been so long since i have seen it that i forgot how to spell the dang title.  oh and they need to bring the good episodes of dragonball z back.  not the crappy gt.  yuck.  sorry i know this is inuyasha section.  blowing some steam.  oh and for the devoted kagome fans i don't hate her.  if i was her and fighting demons i would pick sensible clothes.  fortunately for kagome her clothes are gravity defying.

Do as many shows as you can, especially as opening acts for bigger but similar artists.  Make a demo with a few original songs, and send it to several record labels (look at which labels similar artists are on).  Also, as much I personally hate it, a myspace music account reallly helps spread the word, or preferrably, a website.  Finally, be patient, and work as hard as you can.
no one knows ... it's a running gag on the show as there are so many cities named Springfield.\n\nThat is unless you can find a Springfield located on the ocean, near mountains, in the middle of the country, both east and west of the Mississippi River and possessing a major airport and a nuclear power plant.

Click Records, 3 the God Way, Canton Jones, Toby Mac, Thousand Foot Crutch, Platinum Souls, Manifesto, Grits, Holy Hit Makerz, KJ-52, John Rueben, Lecrae, Mr. Del, Lil iRocc, Verbs, Cross Movement, Kirk Franklin, Apple Jaxx, Romio no E, L.A. Symphony, Shei Atkins, Travy Joe, Mista and Mrs. Taylor, Probly Pablo, DJ Maj, Out of Eden, Tonex, Mynista, Y.N.G. Souljah, Mars Ill, and Papa San to name a few that we like.  \n\nThere are tons of places to buy music like this online if you don't have a Christian bookstore near you that has a good stock of hip-hop.  Some places that we go are:\n www.bus-shop.com\nwww.musicforce.com\nwww.cdbaby.com\nwww.musicchristian.com\n\nEven with Christian hip-hop, you have to check the lyrics.  If the words and actions of the artist are shady, you don't want to be hearing false preachers.  We like music in other genres, too.  Out of all of the ones listed, I would say that my personal favorites at this time are Canton Jones, Out of Eden, Toby Mac, Flame, Probly Pablo, and Manifesto.

Like I told someone else, each sign has their match(es), depending on your source, and their opposite.  Your opposite has personality traits that you lack and vice versa.  The catch with opposites is they can usually end up being the best possible match IF the two of you can work through any problems that arise seeing as you're both 180 degree opposites.  So keep your opposite sign in mind when matching yourself up.\n\nYour matches are Taurus, Virgo, Scorpio, and Pisces, but your opposite is a Capricorn.
My guess is that they'll probably package it with the original trilogy, but the ORIGINAL versions of those films.  So not only will those interested in buying episodes I-III get screwed, but so will those seeking the original versions of IV-VI.  Marketing...they sure screw ya.

Try going to a music store that sells music books in classical vocal or the music library, they should have the libretto(text)as well as the CD of the song or you may try Google and type Ave Maria. There are many versions of Ave Maria, be sure it's Schubert. If you need anything else e-mail me Klm4k8@umkc.edu. And you can try iTunes or classical CD of Schubert. :O)

ATRAC is a Sony proprietory digital music compression much like .mp3 or AAC.  Problem is it is only playable on Sony stuff.  Sony almost choked on it when they introduced it in the digital players meant to compete with iPod because it would play ONLY atrac and no mp3.  Hundreds of mp3's on your computer?  Sorry you gotta convert them all to atrac for your Sony player.  Consumers screamed, Sony listened...sorta.  How many codecs do we need?

"Well to start off, the bands name, if I'm not mistaking, means His Infernal Majesty, if you look at my sources dictionary.com states the meaning of infernal as ""Of or relating to a lower world of the dead.""  So the name alone refers to the ""Majesty"" or king of the ""underworld"".  That alone would lead you to believe it so, but it is all about how you interpret things, ""Wings of a Butterfly"" , a song by H.I.M. and a personaly favorite of mine, refers to sacrafices and rituals, and ripping the wings off of a butterfly as if to save a soul, and refers to many gods, which isn't quite Christian, but theres constant talk of love and the bands symbol is the ""Heartogram"" dare I mind you it resembols the symbol of ""witchcraft"", ""satanism"", ""wicken"" or what have you it is more or less a symbol of a heart, which can be taken as love or loyalty to the devil.  Another aspect to concider is these guys are Finnish (as in they are from Finland) their culture is much different from America I imagine.  All in all I don't find their lyrics satanic or offencive, and personaly like H.I.M.  But you should read up on a couple songs and make your own judgement, I provided the partial lyrics to WoaB below and a link to its full lyrics, and you can search yahoo for the rest.\n\n""Wings of a Butterfly"" - H.I.M.\nHeaven ablaze in our eyes \nWe're standing still in time \nThe blood on our hands is the wine\nWe offer as sacrifice \n\n[Chorus]\nCome on, and show them your love \nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul, my love\nRip out the wings of a butterfly\nFor your soul\n\nThis endless mercy mile \nWe're crawling side by side \nWith hell freezing over in our eyes \nGods kneel before our crime\n\nBest of Luck,\nBrad D."

"The twelve ghosts which make up the Black Zodiac all have their own unique back story, and while these were not described in the film, the production and make-up teams used them as guidelines. All the ghosts were contained in glass prisons, and were caught with the aid of the psychic Rafkin, who could locate them, and on the behalf of Cyrus.\n\n1. The First Born Son (played by Mikhael Speidel)\n\nThe First Born Son is the ghost of a little boy called Billy Michaels, who was obsessed with cowboy films. Not heeding his parents' advice, he played Cowboys and Indians with a real bow and arrow, and the arrow went straight through his forehead.\n\n2. The Torso (played by Daniel Wesley)\n\nThe Torso is the ghost of a gambler called Jimmy Gambino. Losing everything in a poker game, he tried to welch on his bet and escape. The mob, which he owed money to, caught up with Gambino and cut him into several pieces, wrapping them in cellophane and dumping the corpse.\n\n3. The Bound Woman (played by Laura Mennel)\n\nThe Bound Woman was a cheerleader, who was strangled after a high school prom after cheating on her boyfriend. She was strangled by him, and was later found buried on the football field.\n\n4. The Withered Lover (played by Kathryn Anderson)\n\nThe Withered Lover is Jean Kriticos, the wife of Arthur. She died in the freak house fire while trying to rescue her children.\n\n5. The Torn Prince (played by Craig Olejnik)\n\nThe Torn Prince is the ghost of Royce Clayton, who was a baseball star. He challenged a greaser to a drag race and was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\n6. The Angry Princess (played by Shawna Loyer)\n\nThe Angry Princess is Dana Newman, who constantly tried achieving perfection with her looks, despite being beautiful. She gave up eventually and slit her own wrists. She was found with dozens of self-inflicted gashes on her. The movie suggests that she killed herself for another reason (In the scene when she appears in the bathroom, you see the phrase ""I'm sorry"" on the floor in blood). This, however, was probably there to add more drama to the scene and not true.\n\n7. The Pilgrimess (played by Xantha Radley)\n\nThe Pilgrimess is the ghost of Isabella Smith, an English woman who travelled across the Atlantic and settled in New England. She was a separatist, and this isolated her from the other townsfolk. She was found guilty of witchcraft, and put to death in the stocks (pillory).\n\n8. & 9. The Great Child and The Dire Mother (played by C. Ernst Harth and Laurie Soper)\n\nThe Dire Mother is the ghost of Margaret Shelburne, who was imprisoned by a group of lumberjacks, forced to live in a cage as a form of entertainment, due to her being only three feet tall. She had a child with one of the lumberjacks, a son Harold who weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nHarold was spoiled by his mother, who raised him to be her protector and to exact revenge on the lumberjacks. Harold took up his father's axe, and was capable of chopping down massive redwoods single-handedly. Eventually he turned the axe on the other lumberjacks, and both he and his mother were killed by a frenzied mob.\n\n10. The Hammer (played by Herbert Duncanson)\n\nThe Hammer is the ghost of a blacksmith, George Markley, who lived in a small town in the 1890s. He was driven out of town after wrongfully being accused of stealing. Enraged, he tracked down the people responsible and hammered them to death. The other townsfolk captured him, and they drove large nails into his body and cut off his hands.\n\n11. The Jackal (played by Shane Wyler)\n\nThe Jackal is Ryan Kuhn, a psychotic mental patient with a penchant for attacking women. He was permanently in a straitjacket, and had a metal cage locked around his head. After years of this, he had grown deformed, and reviled human contact. He was the only victim of a fire that broke out in the asylum; he apparently ran into the flames rather than let anyone touch him.\n\n12. The Juggernaut (playe"

Here is your detailed synopsis:\n\nKyle Pratt is a frantic but fiercely intelligent mother whose deepest protective instincts will be triggered by a haunting in-flight nightmare: in the middle of the trans-Atlantic trip, her young daughter turns up missing without a trace. Or does she? Kyle arrives on the flight still reeling from the recent loss of her husband, a woman who has gone mad with grief or a formidably determined mother whose child is in grave danger that threatens the entire plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\n\nStarring:   Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby
"Here's a few excellent movies, spread out over a few different genres.\n\nDrama: 1.) Gangs of New York. Including powerhouse performances by Leonardo Dicaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz, this is a very poignant and touching film about the gangs that lived in the Five Points in New York from the mid-1800's up to Civil War times, and the rivalries b/n the ""Natives,"" a gang comprising of everyone that first lived there, and the ""Dead Rabbits,"" which is what the people who came from Ireland called themselves.\n\n2.) Amelie. This is a French movie directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Alien Resurrection and The City of Lost Children), and using a very vivid colorful style, this movie is about a young woman who, one day when she discovers a small cigar box left in her house for years, decides to help people out in mysterious, anonymous ways. But when she meets the guy of her dreams, can she find the courage to do for herself what she has done for others?\n\nComedy: Young Frankenstein. The best film Mel Brooks ever made, and one of the funniest comedies of all time, this film stars Gene Wilder (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory) as the legendary Dr. Frankenstein, in this classic parody of the classic Frankenstein movies. One of the funniest moments in this movie is when the Frankenstein monster visits an old blind hermit, played by Gene Hackman, who offers to feed the monster, and does things to the monster like pour hot things like soup and coffee in his lap and light his thumb on fire. This movie is not to be missed!\n\nHorror: Suspiria. Not very hard to find, this is an Italian movie (dubbed in English) about a young woman who arrives at a dance school and quickly discovers that strange things are going on in the school, including mysterious murders. Filmed using very vivid visual colors, the film's haunting music was performed by a group called The Goblins.\n\nAnime: 1) Princess Mononoke. This is an amazing movie about a young man called Ashitaka, who after one day of saving his hometown from a demon, gets cursed by the demon and has to leave the town and go on a journey to discover a cure for himself before the curse spreads over his whole body and kill him. In the meantime he comes across a war that's being fought b/n people and the gods of the forest, which are giant animals, and only wanting peace, tries to stop it. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, this beautiful, exciting epic film has a message about preserving life.\n\n2) The Irresponsible Captain Tylor. This is actually a TV series, made in about 1993. The character of the title is a 20yo boy who likes to hit on any pretty female he sees. After seeing an advertisement w/a pretty girl in it, he decides to sign up for the United Planet Space Force and becomes an officer. Blessed with incredible luck, he very quickly rises in rank to captain of the starship Soyokaze, and has to deal with the Raalgon Empire, whom the UPSF is at war with. Not to be missed, one of the funniest aspects of this show is that when everything seems dire for Tylor and his crew in a battle with the Raalgon, somehow his luck prevails and he surprisingly comes out victorious.\n\nHope that helps!"

"Hello! I hope this helps...\n\nIndigenous musical styles\n\n*Southern styles\nAmong the various groups of the island of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, a highly sophisticated musical repotoire called kulintang exists in which the main instruments used are bossed gongs not dissimilar to gongs used in Indonesia.\n\nAmong the Tausug of the Sulu Archipelago, The Sindil (sung verbal jousts) is a musical lighthearted style that is sung by a duo of both sexes sung in front of an audience. Teasing, jokes, and innuendos flow into the verses, the better ones being applauded by the audience. The gabbang xylophone and biyula traditional violin are the instuments mainly used. Although Sindil is a particular genre of music, the verbal jousting musical type is also found in many other parts of the country, especially among the Visayan peoples, who are ethnically related to the Tausug. Sindil are normally used at weddings and other festive events.\nOther musical traditions of this region are those of the serenade form Kapanirong and the outdoor ""loud"" music repotoire called Tagonggo.\n\n*Northern styles\nAmong the indigenous peoples of the Central Cordilleras of the northern island of Luzon, music is also played with gongs, but unlike those of southern repoitoires, these gongs, called Gangsa, are unbossed and have their origins in mainland Asia. Music is usually played to accompany dance, and because of this is mostly percussion based. gong ensembled are normally accompanied by drums. The music is polyphonic, and uses highly interlocking repeated patterns.\n\nSPANISH INFLUENCE\n\n*Harana\nThe Harana first gained popularity in the early part of the Spanish Period. It's influence comes from folk Music of Spain and the Mariachi sounds of Mexico. It is a traditional form of courtship music in which a man woos a woman by singing underneath her window at night. It is widely practiced in many parts of the Philippines with a set of protocols, a code of conduct, and a specific style of music. Harana itself uses mainly Hispanic protocols in music, although its origins lie in the old pre-colonial Philippine musical styles which still practised around the country (See Also Kapanirong style of the Maguindanao of Mindanao). The main instument used for Harana is the Guitar, played by the courter, although other string instruments such as the Ukelele and less frequiently, the Violin and Trumpets are also used.\n\n*Kundiman\nThe Kundiman is a lyrical song made popular in the Philippines in the early 19th century, but having origins in older pre-colonial indigenous styles. Composed in the Western idiom, the song is characterized by a minor key at the beginning and shifts to a major key in the second half. Its lyrics depict a romantic love, usually portraying the forlorn pleadings of a lover willing to sacrifice everything on behalf of his beloved. In many others, it is a plaintive call of the rejected lover or the broken-hearted. In others, it is a story of unrequited love. Almost all traditional Filipino love songs in this genre are heavy with poetic emotion."

Sean Paul most def!! There is no contest!!!
Tivo does not have any service like Itunes, Limewire, etc.  With the home network features though, any music you have on your computer can be listened to directly on your Tivo.  they have also added new features in the last few weeks that allow you to listen to Podcasts from the web and many streaming radio stations.
"First of all,actors do have to go to castings...We usually think that just because they are already famous or well known, they always get called for parts. that is far from the truth..\nSome screen writers make characters having a specific actor in mind, like for example Tarantino that usually wants an actor in specific...but most of the time..managers get the screenplay(movie) and contact there actor and make them do the casting for that part.some actors get it..some dont...you can be a great actor but if another one makes the role of a ""retard"" just a little bit better that you,then you know who will most likely win the part."

No, he was the guitarist that went nuts at the music video awards, the reason they broke up!!!

Have you tried Cingular.com? They have lots.
Post Office.\n;)
Nope. \nOn the off chance that he didn't die in 1977 (I believe he did) there is no way a body packed with that many drugs and arteries clogged with the fat of a million or so fried banana and peanut butter sandwiches could last this long. It's a miracle he lived as long as he did when you think about it.
they are live i think...
Ultimate-Guitar.com is really good about providing accurate chords and tablature. Most of the chords and tablature I use for Nickelback songs are from that website.
I'd go with both the drummer and bass player answers but Vapor Trails is possibly their best album/CD.\n\nI'd also call them the best (but certianly not most popular).\n\nOh, and fantastic lyrics, detailed time signature changes, and if anyone out there knows of a band that writes more complicated music, I'd like to know about it.
The birth of Wyatt...It truly was magical
If this question could be answered, then they would no longer be Lost and the show would end.

Like passing the basket or singing your own tune!\n\nPassing the basket: Several small rolled up papers with different nasty dirty words in them are passed around while the music plays.Anyone holding the basket or bowl will pick a paper and a supervisor reads the content aloud, anything it says must the person follow or pay a fine of $????!\n\nsiniging your tune; You are given a song to sing and then change the wordings into funny, vulgar or abusive lyrics.

"Oh good lord! Jack of course! Chuck would get all into some contorted sort of martial arts pose and then Jack would just up and shoot him in the leg and yell, ""Tell me where the bomb's at!!!""

Capt Picard, of course.  He wasn't a prick like Riker. More interesting than Data.  Not as gay as La Forge

I dont think hes gay but he damn sure gets on my nerves.  I get sick of his hair stroking and staring into the camera.  Its like watching Constantine all over again but less talented.
Yeah, you are right, the movie did not follow the rules of vampirism... many vampires were killed by bullets in underworld.

Why waste your time asking this question on here?  Go to ebay yourself, and look it up.  Dang dude, don't you know that this site is for asking questions that you can't just look up easily?  You are asking about a specific website.  Just go to the damn website and look it up!

Ebay is the best answer since you'll find out how much the books ACTUALLY sell for, but it's often no good for single issues (a random issue of X-Men or Superman can fluctuate between 1.50 and 10.00 between listings unless it's traded particularly often because without a steady stream of buying and selling you'd dependant upon a few random buyers and just because I'm willing to pay $10 for one issue doesn't mean anyone else would.)\n\nhttp://www.comicspriceguide.com/ has individual issues, and you can also try any comic store website to see what they price it at.  Keep in mind that these prices are usually at a premium and not necessarily what you could expect to get if you, for instance, listed them on Ebay or sold at a convention.

In a fictional book, you don't have to worry about accuracy as far as writing it.  You can make up whatever you want.  As far as reading it, you aren't too concerned with historical accuracy unless you're a Middle Earth nerd and know everything there is to know about the Elven race...including who fathered who(it's seems about as ridiculous as Leviticus at times).  You can imagine fictional animals and such...and the images won't be ruined unless you see a movie about the book.
Aside from the very cliche E-major, F-major, G-major thing, try playing around with:\nE-minor, F#7, B-7, E-minor.\n\nOn www.classtab.org you can download tablature for lots of classical guitar pieces, including a lot of spanish/brazillian sounding things.  Look for pieces by Heitor Villa-Lobos.  You can listen to the midi files first, and then look at the tab to see how to play certain parts.

I really like the remake of Freaky Friday w/ Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis.  Of course the original one w/ Jodie Foster was good too, but I like the new one better because the situations are more up to date.  If you haven't heard of this movie, the basic premise is that the mother and daughter switch roles (like, the daughter is trapped in the mother's body & vice versa) until each one totally understands the other's perspective on things.\n\nHope this helps!
I think it was actually Captain Picard. His character was better developed than Kirk. Also, he took an approach that gave his crew more power in the decision making process, and I thought that was smarter.

Baby pageants here are for boys and girls. They always have several winners and they usally get put on the covers of baby magazines and get scholarships. Also if you contact Baby Talk magazine they are always looking for baby models. If you can't find Baby Talk magazine, they always have them at pediatricians and OB/GYN offices. Good luck!!

"nick's as told by ginger. :D\n\ni love the show, because it portrays well the life of a typical teen- aged (or pre- teen) girl, who gets caught in your average everyday problems, like having popularity issues, an at- times- hostile *in* crowd, separated parents, annoying little brothers, love and relationships, friendships, among many other issues. it's about trying to fit in, and finding out who you really are and how those around you help you be that person you want to be.\n\n~~ As Told by Ginger is an American animated television series which debuted on Nickelodeon in October of 2000. Produced by Klasky Csupo Inc. (the creators of the Rugrats media franchise), and created by Emily Kapnek, the show revolves around the life of Ginger Foutley, a typical junior high school student who lives in a fictional Connecticut community named Sheltered Shrubs. The show is unique, in that many of the characters have actual wardrobes (to save time and money most cartoon characters are almost always drawn wearing the same outfit).\n\nCharacters\nGinger Foutley (Melissa Disney), the main character, talented poet (there are two episodes that deal with poems she's written) and diary keeper (she's often seen writing in it), \n\nDeidre Hortense ""Dodie"" Bishop (Aspen Miller) and Macie Lightfoot (Jackie Harris), Ginger's two slightly dorky best friends, \n\nCourtney Gripling (Liz Georges), their rich and arrogant classmate who has been hanging out with Ginger. Courtney completely disappeared during the high school episodes. \n\nMiranda Killgallen (Cree Summer), who has been doing things to keep Courtney and Ginger apart (in the very first episode, she even has her arrested for stealing, after she recommended Ginger to do so for Courtney's birthday party). \n\nCarl Foutley (Jeannie Elias) and Robert Joseph ""Hoodsey"" Bishop (Tress MacNeille), Ginger and Dodie's younger brothers respectively, who tend to do weird things that are, most of the time, a given episode's subplot (for example, running a lunch cart), \n\nBlake Gripling (Kath Soucie), Courtney's younger brother, who occasionally tags along with Carl and Hoodsey, \n\nLois Foutley (Laraine Newman), Ginger's divorced mother, who works as a late shift nurse at a local hospital, \n\nDarren Patterson (Kenny Blank), Ginger's next door neighbor, who later becomes her boyfriend. \n\nalso, i love hey! arnold. and spongebob squarepants, and anime like boys be, gto, gundam wing among MANY others"

Go to some art exhibitions/showings. Take some kayaking lessons. Maybe go take some mountain climbing lessons. Take a Yoga class. Even if you already know how to do this stuff, a class like that is a good place to meet women with similar interests, and it shows them that you are not a close minded person, that you are willing to do and try new things. If all else fails, church is a good place to meet women. If all of this fails, go to the bar, hook up for the night, and re-think the problem in the morning.

If you want an audio clip, it can most likely be found on a p2p file sharing system like LimeWire.  I found the audio clip from there but it was a long time ago.  They may also have the video clip but you can never tell what will surface from one search to another.  Thats the best I can offer you. Or find a way to record it yourself from the dvd. I used to have an mp3 player that would plug into devices and record the current playing audio.  I got a lot of movie audio clips that way.

The scenery of 'Troy' is pretty accurate . . . the costumes are pretty, and that's about as far as it goes.  The writers took A LOT of liberties with history simply in the fact that the 'bad guy' won.  That is, the Greeks sacked Troy, killed all the men, threw the babies from the walls and sent the women to various city-states as slaves.  Paris and Helen didn't escape in a tunnel.  No happy ending, but Hollywood seems to frequently ignore the facts.  They could have called it anything but 'Troy' and been more accurate.\n\nYes, I own the movie because Eric Bana & Brad Pitt look great in skirts.  Oh, and Sean Bean.  Yes.

THANK YOU!  This question has been bugging me for quite a while.  These people and their music are just fakes and phonies and that crap needs to be pulled off the market ASAP.
The Conductor uses a 'baton' to lead an orchestra.\n\nA 'metronome' is used to keep time while practicing.
It goes like this I don't like to be alone in the night, I don't like to here when I'm wrong or when I'm right, I don't like to have the rain on my shoes but i do love you..... now that is the first verse if you want the other one ask the question again as soon a possible.
"The title of music director is used by many symphony orchestras to designate the primary conductor and artistic leader of the orchestra. The title is principally used in North America and Asia, with titles such as ""principal conductor"" or ""chief conductor"" more common in Europe.\n\nIn the 20th century, the title and position typically brought with it an almost unlimited influence over the particular orchestra's affairs. As implied by the name, the music director not only conducts concerts, but also controls what music the orchestra will perform or record, and has much authority regarding hiring, firing, and other personnel decisions over an orchestra's musicians. Such authoritarian rule, once expected and even thought necessary for a symphonic ensemble to function properly, has loosened somewhat in the closing decades of the 20th century with the advent and encouragement of more power sharing and cooperative management styles (with the orchestra musicians themselves, the administrative staff, and volunteer board of directors).\n\nThe term music director became common in the United States in the middle of the 20th century, following an evolution of titles. Early leaders of orchestras were simply designated as the ""conductor."" In the 1930s, the term musical director began to be used, in order to delineate the fact that the person in this position was doing much more than just conducting, and to differentiate them from guest conductors who simply led one particular program or concert. George Szell, for instance, was appointed as ""musical director"" of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1946, and his position was so named until his death in 1970. His successor, Lorin Maazel, was given the title ""music director."" Other major American orchestras kept more current with the times and began using the simpler term in the 1950s and '60s.\n\nAlternatively, the term ""music director"" is sometimes the title listed in the film credits for a professional hired to supervise and direct the music selected for a film or music documentary, or for the conductor in charge of music for a theatrical production or Broadway musical.\n\nHope this helps mate."

No, I consider it to be yet another thing thats wrong with this world. It enrages me so much when I hear stories of David Beckham and his wife buying £100,000 yachts as christmas presents for one another when there are people dying in this world of starvation. \n\nI also have another theory. For every self centred actress who spends hundreds of thousands on looking emaciated in the name of beauty, why don't we send them off to a third world country, where they can starve themselves for free, and in return, use the money they would have spent to help people who don't want to starve.

Taurus & Virgo \nWhen Taurus and Virgo come together in a love affair, it's a union of innate practicality. Both of these Signs employ practicality in their daily lives as the most efficient means to most problems. They can be quite sincere and devoted to one another; as people, both have a great deal of integrity. Virgo likes Taurus's strength and dedication while Taurus appreciates Virgo's quick mind. \nDue to Virgo's naturally cautious nature, this relationship can take awhile to develop, but once it's established that both partners are in it for the long haul, it's like a runaway locomotive, running on its own power and difficult to stop. These two Signs have much in common: They highly value common sense and practicality; they're both materialistic but work hard for the creature comforts they so enjoy. Taurus is more sensual and indulgent than Virgo is; Virgo tends to be the inhibitive force in the relationship, tending not to get involved in the chaos of life in favor of analyzing all available options. Virgo's analysis leads to criticism, which Taurus can tend to take too seriously. Conversely, Taurus's stubborn nature can get on Virgo's nerves, causing Virgo to criticize even more! This pair must take care not to take one another too seriously. The good thing is, they're similar enough that they can learn to be patient with one another, especially Virgo, who loves to indulge Taurus's penchant for fine treatment and good food.\nTaurus is ruled by Venus (Love and Money) and Virgo is ruled by Mercury (Communication). Both of these Planets are close to the Sun, so they're closely related though they seem very different. Venus is physical; it's about romance and sensuality, both of which are important to Taurus. Mercury is about communication and it's androgynous -- Virgo will take on the form that it chooses. Virgo is very good at understanding other people and can easily learn to be the romantic and sensual partner that Taurus loves. Both partners are so devoted and romantic, their arguments surely won't focus on those issues. \nTaurus and Virgo are both Earth Signs. Earth Signs are steady and practical, concerned with possessions. Taurus and Virgo together love to surround themselves with beautiful things -- an opulent home, gorgeous artwork, classy cars. Their love of luxury and their desire to be financially secure ensure that this couple will work hard who never overspend. \nTaurus is a Fixed Sign and Virgo is a Mutable Sign. Taurus is stubborn and tends to make up their mind for good; more flexible Virgo can help teach Taurus the value in bending the mind a bit -- when it's practical, of course. \nWhat's the best aspect of the Taurus-Virgo relationship? Their dedication to working toward the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and Virgo likes helping Taurus achieve their goals. Their common interests and desires make theirs a highly compatible relationship.

"Terms from the days of vinyl records. As I worked in a record store selling Vinyl for 2 years during the 80s, I got to work intimately with them... so...\n\nLP = Long Play (full length album) - 33 1/3 speed\nEP = Extended Play (as in extended from a single) - 33 1/3 speed\nSingle = one song a side - 45 speed\n\nLP records could be a maximum of about 40 minutes with microgrooving, less without.\nEP records were from 3-20 minutes (as I recall).\n\nAn LP could hold 5-6 songs per side.\nAn EP could hold 1-3 (cramped at 3) per side.\nA single could hold one song per side.\n\nHow they were used.  Bands generally used LPs for full length album releases.  EPs were used commonly to release a short album release (a few songs or extended remix singles).  The EP format was also typically used on 12"" singles.  12"" singles also ran 33 1/3 speed.  45's (singles) were obviously used to release two songs from an album (not usually remixes).\n\nSizes for vinyl include 12"", 10"" and 7"" diameter.  EPs could be 10"" or 12"".  LPs were only 12"".  45's were only 7"".  \n\nAnd finally, there were picture disks.  These were a special process to overlay the vinyl grooves on top of a picture.  They were generally heavier and the vinyl didn't hold up as long.  Picture disks were, as I recall, always 12"" in size."

I can't imagine any reason why a party for a one year old would be any place other than at home.\n\nThe only reasons one might have it elsewhere seem to be:\n\n1.

Have it at a dance hall if your child cannot enjoy herself without dancing.\n\n4.  Have it at a country club if your child must golf during her party.

yes she did
I think the point they were trying to make at the end of the movie was what Evey, and essentially V, did at the end blowing up Parliament was for everyone dead and alive. If you noticed at the end, the cop asked her who he was and she was said that he was her mother, her father, brother, her, and the cop. That's why they showed Gordon, her mother, and her brother at the end. He sort of represented the people, only before he came along people were scared to speak up against their government, but after he went on TV and challenged everyone to think, that's when they started to agree with him. This was my interpretation. Hope this helps.

Well, it happened.  There is nothing ANYONE can do about that.  But it was wrong.  Just like it was wrong for the Egyptians to use slave labor to build the pyramids.  Just like it is wrong for those crappy little third world countries to use children for slave labor.  And so on.  It is NOT just an American problem, but a world problem.

The Church of Scientology has a history of going after their critics.

There is a technique called skim-reading that you can develop, where you literally scan the page, searching only for the relevant key details. \n\nThe technique for this is to remember that generally, each paragraph will only have one point to make within it, so once you feel you've extracted that point, move on. \n\nThis technique is partly intuitive, but really, you have to perceive the book in a differnt light, rather than something to be pored over, and relished, it is simply a tool to extract information from. \n\nDon't put pressure on yourself though, it takes time. Eventually, your eyes will learn to disregard the chaff (skimming over words such as 'and, 'is', 'they' 'we' etc, and focus only on the bits that give you the gist of the story / thesis.
"A ventriloquist is sitting onstage at a comedy club and he was telling rude blonde jokes, when a blonde woman stood up and said, ""I'm so sick of you people who give us blondes a bad name! It's JUSTb/c of you that I have to work twice as hard in my comm. just to shoe others I'm not dumb! There are other dumb brown heads and read head that are equally stupid as blondes!!"" \nThe ventriliquist said, ""Gee miss, I'm sorry, I didn't think of that before I said that."" \nTo which the blonde replied, ""Shut up I'm NOT talking to you!! I'm talking to that little jerk in your lap!!!"""

Is this the song you mean?\n\nPantera — “Cowboys from Hell”\n\nUnder the lights where we stand tall\nNobody touches us at all\nShowdown, shootout, spread fear within, without\nWe’re gonna take what’s ours to have\nSpread the word throughout the land\nThey say the bad guys wear black\nWe’re tagged and can’t turn back\n\nYou see us comin’\nAnd you all together run for cover\nWe’re takin over this town\n\nHere we come reach for your gun\nAnd you better listen my friend, you see\nIt’s been slow down below,\nAimed at you we’re the cowboys from hell\nDeed is done again, we’ve won\nAin’t talking no tall tales friend\n’cause high noon, your doom\nComin’ for you we’re the cowboys from hell\n\nPillage the village, trash the scene\nBut better not take it out on me\n’cause a ghost town is found\nWhere your city used to be\nSo out of the darkness and into the light\nSparks fly everywhere in sight\nFrom my double barrel, 12 gauge,\nCan’t lock me in your cage\n\nYou see us comin’\nAnd you all together run for cover\nWe’re takin over this town\n\nHere we come reach for your gun\nAnd you better listen my friend, you see\nIt’s been slow down below,\nAimed at you we’re the cowboys from hell\nDeed is done again, we’ve won\nAin’t talking no tall tales friend\n’cause high noon, your doom\nComin’ for you we’re the cowboys from hell\n\nhttp://www.lyricsfreak.com/p/pantera/104363/print.html

Bones and Booth go down to the tunnels that run underneath Washington, D.C. to investigate a body. They find out the body was a women documentary maker. She was making a film about the people who live underground. One of the suspects was man, who lives underground. Bones found a crate in his house, that had bloody clothes, and a camera. After talking to him, they find out he gave her something, and he is convinced that is the reason she died. They find a amulet with her things and soon discover it goes to a vault. In the show, they said that during the 1800's the American government had vaults full of precious items hidden in vaults under Washington. Some of the vaults were never found due to cave ins. So Bones and Booth try to find the vault. Along the way they discover another body. This one being from the Civil War. They also find that the documentary maker hired two rock climbers to help her find the treasure. Bones and Booth soon realize that one of the climbers had killed the women. Before they can arrest them they have to find them. They both believe they are in the vault. So underground they go. They find the two in a vault loading gold into bags. Bones finally gets to point a gun at someone. In the end one of the climbers killed the women because of greed. The first suspect was released and went back underground.

"Well, as informative as the Wikipedia is (to the non-initiated), to ANSWER your question, Captain America proper was not assigned to any specific unit; he was a freelance operative, more akin to an OSS officer, as he pretty much was sent where he was most needed as events warrented, though he often tried to help out any ""common joes"" he might meet along the course of his movements. And though given the rank of ""Captain,"" he pretty much only took orders from the President and top-level brass, so the idea of our favorite shield-slinger ""falling in"" to formation every morning with a commun unit and being checked to see if he shaved and shined his boots is a little...silly."

"SOCAN is an acronym, which stands for\n\nS        ociety \nO        f Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of\nCAN      ada.\n\nFrom their website (first link below):\n\n""SOCAN is an organization that administers in Canada the performing rights of virtually the world's entire repertoire of copyright-protected music. We distribute the fees collected as royalties to our members and affiliated performing rights organizations (PROs) worldwide.

We do this by collecting licence fees from individuals, businesses and organizations that play music in public, broadcast it, or communicate it by telecommunication.

"I never heard it said that it was Chris' own arrangement of the song.  I don't think that Chris tried to pass it off as his own arrangement because just the week before he gave proper credit to the Red Hot Chili Peppers for doing a similar version of ""Higher Ground"". The judges just said that he knows what songs are right for his voice. There has been speculation as to whether Chris mentioned Live's version in the pre-performance monologue and that it was edited out.  I think it is getting completely blown out of proportion and I hope it doesn't hurt Chris' chances.  He is one of the best performers in the competition in my opinion."

Anime (アニメ) is a style of cartoon animation originating in Japan. Anime is characterized by character and background styles which may be created by hand or may be assisted by computers. Storylines may feature a variety of characters and may be set in different locations and in different eras. Anime is aimed at a broad range of audiences because there are a wide range of different genres that any series may be categorised under. Anime may be broadcast on television, distributed on media, such as DVDs, or published as console and computer games. Anime is often influenced by Japanese comics known as manga. Anime may also be adapted into live action television programs.\n\nSome of the cartoon I've seen really are quite artistically dead, but at the same time some of the magazine anime and video anime are avant garde...\n\nso I can't say I'm whole heartedly behind this movement, but can agree to having seen anime dubbed in English.\n\nso the answer would be D

wow those are 2 completely different musical genres.  Ska, in it's purist form, is from Jamaica in the '60s.  It did gain popularity in the 80's with the two-tone movement, a form of mixing Ska with punk, new wave, rock, and stuff.  New wave was the post punk sound that was a cleaned up version of that music.  They're not directly connected, but they were mixed.

None of these are ""liberal"" entities.\n\nAnyone who claims that NBC, ABC, CNN, etc. display liberal tendencies has been listening to conservative propaganda for far too long.

Yes, it was Gina.  She just let Jade get to her too much.  I am now wondering who Jade will target next.  The others better not show any weakness or Jade will be all over it.  I would like to see Jade go.  She has this attitude that this show is beneath her and that she should already be a huge star.
Work as an intern in a studio with a producer. Take classes in music, communications, and business which is very important. Music is a business and it is a tough business. The more skills you have in music, the better chances of getting a job in this industry. Offer your services to studios and advertise as well as network with people in the industry. Definitely learn where hip hop came from. I did my internship at Virgin Records in England and thanks to that, I work as a fulltime producer at local recording studio.
JLU and Teen Titans
"You are ALL wrong. It was Captain James Shaft. \n\nThe true story of Captain James Hook, the pirate supreme of Never Never Land is a closely guarded secret. If the truth got out, children would be truly terrified. \n\nLong ago in the land of Never Never, Tinkerbelle was married to the gorgeously divine fairy price Jimmyshaft. You see, Bell is her maiden name she was once known as Tikershaft. Any who, one day the young child Peter arrived in Never Never Land and Tinkerbelle asked her husband if that could take him in. Jimmyshaft, being the kind fairy he was agreed. But after a time, Tinker started to fall in love with Peter, as any mother figure would.  Jimmyshaft got very jalousie because all of Tinks time was spent looking after Peter. She didn’t have time to play fairy games and use her magic to make Jimmyshaft happy all the time. One day, Jimmyshaft got so mad that he took a frying pan from the kitchen and hit pan in the head. Tinkerbelle got so mad that she through Jimmyshaft out of the house. This of course caused all sorts of rumors and destroyed the princes image. He was so ashamed that he exiled himself from the rest of the fairy folks and went to live with all the other bad fairs and imps. \n\nOne day many years later, Jimmyshaft saw Peter playing by the water. He pushed Peter in the water. As he did, he started laughing and yelled out, Look at the little pan head sink. Much to Jimmyshafts surprise, Peter knew how to swim. Peter got out of the water and tried swat Jimmyshaft, but he was just too quick and too small. Peter called out, if you were just a little bigger, I'd beat you silly. \n\nFor a long time this continued. Jimmyshaft would play a prank on Peter calling him pan head and Peter, now known as Peter Panhead, would yell out, ""If you where just a little bigger.""  \n\nEventually, after a long time passed, Jimmyshaft was tired of the game.  The final straw was when his now ex-wife Tinkerbelle taught Peter how to fly. He knew the only way he would ever get rid of the pesky Peter Panhead now was to drown him in the sea, but Jimmyshaft was just too small to do the job. So Jimmyshaft used the last of his fairy magic and turned himself and all of the fallen fairies and imps into pirates. There one solitary mission was to destroy the poor Pater Panhead. \n\nThe rest of the story you know. The pirates agreed that Jimmyshaft should be the captain but Captain Jimmyshaft just didn’t sound frightening so he changes his name to Captain James Shaft. But on the very first crusade to get Peter, Peter got the best of the old Pirate Captain and the Crock got his hand. This earned Peter the respect of the other inhabitants of Never Land and they stopped calling him Pan head and simply called him Pan...This later became a time like Khan or Lord. (see the Move Hook as reference.) And the now one handed Pirate Captain James Shaft was forever known as James Hook.\n\nWell, what do you think!  It doesn’t matter, because that's my story and I'm stick'n to it."

If she has pic's all over the place she either just coincidental has his last name and is just abnormally obsessed--in which case you should ask her because I'd imagine she'd be extremely excited to tell someone of her fan worshiping.

Depends what type of music you like.  Audioslave is awesome live.  The band LIVE puts on a great show.  Barenaked Ladies is one of the most fun live shows.
Yeah its a heavy metal music band, so long they've recorded 2 albums, first one (1998) named Psicosofrenia and the secon one (2004) named Breed of Prophanity.\nThere`s also another band of i think is black metal with the same name i think in germany

Well right before that, they show the crowd, and I'm one of the extras in the background with my Dad who is wearing a blue shirt and cowboy hat! It was awesome!!!"
i have never heard of them, so in my opinion it doesnt rock hard, and if it is emo...oh crap...you freak.

"The first song was ""Fury"", the second song was 'Beautiful, Loved and Blessed"". Both of them are on the new CD, 3121 that came out this week."
When Gemini and Libra come together in a love affair, they enjoy a great relationship based on intellectual interests and mental agility. Dual-natured Gemini loves Libra's balance, and Libra is always entertained by the chatty, brainy Twins. Libra loves art and beauty while Gemini loves the beauty of an idea, but these loves aren't far off from one another.\n\nBoth Gemini and Libra have a great deal of mental energy. They can come up with all sorts of great ideas when they work together, and Libra has the get-up-and-go needed to put their ideas into action, a quality which Gemini tends to lack. In fact, in the birth of an idea Gemini is better at pontification than direction, but this is a valuable contribution to Libra's mental process. Both Signs share a need for intellectual freedom, which they can certainly provide for one another.\n\nLibra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Libra and Gemini work well together; they combine the forces of love and communication. As Libra prizes harmony with their lover almost above all else, Gemini won't be able to indulge their love of a good, hearty debate too often; Libra would rather do almost anything than argue.\n\nBoth Libra and Gemini are Air Signs. Gemini loves Libra's energy and has no trouble keeping up when Libra is off and running with a new idea, art project or other pursuit. Both Signs have wide-ranging interests, giving them great material for provocative discussion.\n\nGemini is a Mutable Sign and Libra is a Cardinal Sign. Libra likes a position of leadership in a relationship. They most often come up with the date ideas, for example, and flexible Gemini's happy to go along -- as long as it's okay to change their minds at the last minute. Libra tends to initiate things but has trouble finishing them; Gemini is so adaptable, they won't mind switching gears on a moment's notice and moving on to something else if Libra gets bored.\n\nWhat's the best aspect of the Gemini-Libra relationship? Their ability to work together as an intellectual team. Together they can expose each other to new and different points of view and areas of interest, and help one another open up their worlds.

1. Get a half decent guitar. Don't learn on a cardboard box, it will put you off.\n\n2. Get a decent teacher. It's DEFINITELY worth the money. You can't learn any instrument properly from a video or book, no matter what it says on the cover. How's a book or video going to tell you that you haven't got it quite right?\n\n3. Practise regularly, daily if possible, for a decent length of time. 10 minutes twice a week will not make you a guitarist. Having said that, don't go mad and try to do 3 or 4 hours every time you practise, your brain stops absorbing new stuff after a while. 30 minutes is a good starting point, build it up from there.\n\n4. Expect it to take some time. You won't be out-playing Brian May in 6 months. It takes years of work and dedication.\n\n5. IT'S WORTH THE TIME! Playing an instrument is one of the most rewarding things you can learn.

"here are some of my favorites:\nTwo blondes sit on a park bench at night. One looks up and says, ""What's closer, the Moon or Florida?"" The other one looks over and says, ""Duh, can you see Florida?"" \n\nA blonde is jogging down the road and sees another blonde in a rowboat in the middle of a field.  The blonde on the road shakes her head and sighs.  ""It's blondes like THAT that give us SMART blondes bad names.  If I could swim,"" she said, ""I would go out and help her.""\n\nA blonde walks into a beauty shop with a pair of headphones on. She asks for a haircut. The blonde is led to a chair and asked to sit down. The woman who is about to cut the blonde's hair asks her to take the headphones off. The blonde does, and a few minutes later she passes out. The surprised shop worker picks up the headphones and hears a little voice saying, ""Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out..."". \n4,000 blondes pack the auditorium for the first annual Blondes Are Smart competition. A blonde is chosen from the audience to come on stage and answer a question to prove that blondes aren't dumb. The emcee asks ""What is 2 plus 2?"" The blonde thinks for a moment and answers ""Seven."" The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!"" The emcee asks again, ""What is 2 plus 2?"" The blonde concentrates for five minutes and finally answers ""Five."" The emcee shakes his head and the audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance! Give her another chance!"" The emcee asks once again ""What is 2 + 2?"" The blonde screws up her face in thought, scratches her head, and finally answers ""Four?"" The audience begins chanting ""Give her another chance..."" \n\n\nTwo blondes are walking in a forest, they spot a pair of tracks. One suggests they're bear tracks, while the other says that they a fox tracks. Then they get hit by a train. \n\nQ: How do you make a blonde laugh on Monday morning? \nA: Tell her a joke on Friday night. \n\nQ: If you drop a blonde and a brunette from 100 ft, which hits the ground first? \nA: The brunette, because the blonde has to ask directions on the way down. \n\nEnjoy!"
He is a looser because he's acting like he was a little bit famous before he married Britney Spears, but I think he was just a back up dancer that no one really knew or cared that much about to really know.

That depends on whether or not you consider a bass to guitar. There are plently of bands which have a guitar and a bass, for example AC/DC and The Who. There are also a plenty of bands that have two guitars IN ADDITION to the bass, for example The Allman Brothers and The Beatles.

It's a matter of personal preference. (and of course nothing beats a real piano.) But Digital pianos are easier to maintain. I suggest going to the store and playing all these models. I personally like Yamaha. I'd stay away from Casio. Don't know much about Kawai. Kurzweill and Korg have some of the leading technologies as far as sounding like a piano is concerned. You'll want something truly weighted to feel like a grand piano.
999
There music is jarring, contrived and gratuitous.
YES, DR DRE WAS FAT ONCE UPON A TIME.
"They sang from the American Standards Songbook with coaching from Rod Stewart and this was the singing order and song choice:\n\n1. Chris Daughtry - “What A Wonderful World”\n2. Paris Bennett - “These Foolish Things""\n3. Taylor Hicks - “You Send Me”\n4. Elliott Yamin - “It Had To Be You” \n5. Kellie Pickler - “Bewitched” \n6. Ace Young - “That’s All”\n7. Katharine McPhee - “Someone To Watch Over Me” \n\nParis, Elliott & Katharine kicked major butt on their performances.  Chris was out of his element.  Taylor was good, but he's been better.  Kellie self-admitted that she butchered it.  Was totally off-key and let the music get ahead of her.  Ace has GOT to go."

Well, it depends on what our desires is it? But the options here whether we can use it wisely or besides that. For me, if i had given this gift for one day, I'll hope i can visit someone who is really famous such as politicians, stars, etc. I know that I'll never can meet him or her in my lifetime. I mean if I'm not invisible. Maybe i can get somethings either from their daily life or activities.

The Call of Ktulu-no lyrics but its great
The name sounds Jewish.
"I'm sure I'm not alone in this -- Tori Amos.  \n\n  Amongst my friends she's considered ""uncool"" (although having that cool/uncool mentality at my age, to me, is a little pathetic.)  But I've never once wavered in defending her.  \n\n  I'm agnostic, and her music is one of only a handful of things that vouch for the existence of the divine.  \n\n  Even you don't like her songs (or, a more common complaint, her voice), you just cannot deny that she is extrordinarily talented -- she was the youngest person ever to get into the Peabody Conservatory at the age of five.  Even though she comes from the very tired genre of the piano/vocalist/songwriter, her arangements, expression and voice manage to be wholy unique.  \n\n  And those controvercial lyrics.  \n\n""God sometimes you just don't come through/Do you need a woman to look after you?""  Or on the stranger side, \n""Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?"" \n""Father I killed my monkey...""\n\n By listening to her music I was able to teach myself piano, an invaluable skill in my profession."
he's PR told hin to say that
"Tell them you want better commitment from them...DON'T threaten them with the ""I have replacements"" line.  It may be that they are being lazy because they are unhappy about something and you don't know about it because you haven't asked.  Next, consider which musicians are better for the band...the ones you currently have or the next in line.  If the ones that you have lined up are better, and you get along with them (a slightly better player is NOT worth a band chemistry problem) then fire the lazy guys and get the better guys.\n\nBeen here, done this a few times...the best approach is to make sure everything is cool and everyone is on the same page...if you threaten them, the new guys are going to be afraid of you doing the same to them some day down the line."

There aren't any outtakes as in bloopers. Jackson didn't want to put them in because he felt they would take away from the movie, which I have to agree with.

The Bold and The Beautiful.  Brook.  She is so bold and daring.  She has been married to everyone on the show.  She even had a baby with her daughter's husband.

I wouldn't say I was disappointed.  I liked the movie and the story itself.  It didn't make me uncomfortable in any way but that's because I'm actually open minded about this sort of thing and I think everybody should be allowed to love anybody they like whether they're opposite sex or the same sex.  I thought the acting was really good in the movie but the story was slow at times and dragged on. I think Jake Gyllenhaal's character was more 'in love' than Heath Ledger's character.  But there were a few times where I felt really sad for them 'cause they couldn't be together - like that one scene at the lake where Jake's character is really upset they can't see each other.  I'm glad the movie was made.  It definitely shows Hollywood is a bit more open minded these days.  I mean when you think of some foreign movies this subject is not that controversial but for Hollywood it obviously is.  I mean the supposed 'sex scene' wasn't all that bad - at least not as bad as everybody made it seem.  I'm not homophobic so for me it was fine to watch.  And it'll open doors for other small movies with interesting subject matters unlike the same old same old lame Hollywood bullcrap.
Kind of like your question you have just asked

You write a query letter with a synopsis of the idea, then send it to an agent or manager. They'll tell you if they like it or not. But you usually can't sell an idea, you have to write it. But it's possible. Good luck, I've sent many query letters.

Michael Jackson used to be a decent pop star.  But, as with many celebrities, their 'screen' persona is completely different from the person underneath.  Michael Jackson, as a person, is insecure and has strange obsessive desires and behaviors.  Michael Jackson, as a pop star, is a decent musician and knows how to put together good pop music.\n\nThe reality is, you have to be willing to distinguish the pop-star persona of MJ from the real person that is MJ.  There are basically two different people: the MJ on we see on stage and in videos (a persona created by the music industry) and the MJ in real life who dangles babies, hangs out with children and is obsessed with plastic surgery.

Changes in the singing voice are caused by physical changes in the larynx. At puberty, your body is growing and the increase in the size of your larynx causes the first voice change. As you age further, the vocal folds (which are mere folds in the muscle, not chords as so many people believe) grow looser, making it more difficult to hit those high notes.

CDs get a lot of scratches overtime.  I see you have tried the vaseline trick.  Did you try the toothpaste? howabout wipe off?  Let me post it for you in case you haven't:\n\nSquirt toothpaste around the scatched CD. \n\nTake the face cloth (or towel) and wipe the tooth paste (don't use the clear gel type) around. Use a circular pattern, don't rub too hard, but work the scratched area over well, and then wipe it off. Wipe from the centre of the disc to the outer edges to prevent further damage to the disc. \n\nAfter all toothpaste is gone you're good to go. \n\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 if necessary. \n\nThis doesn't always work but it should make a difference. Scratches will be there but it won't skip anymore.\n\nHope I was of help.

The song ""Where the Streets Have No Name"" is all about Bono's experiences in Ethiopia and how he felt like no one was paying any attention to the starvation there.\n\nAlso, Crumbs from your Table on U2's latest album, how to dismantle an atomic bomb, is about how an enormous economy like the US could help out poverty stricken countries with just a few ""crumbs from their table"" (i.e. just a small amount of money in the big scheme of things)"

That's the trouble with porn -- you get case-hardened pretty quickly.  Then everything seems bland, but you're addicted and so you seek something a bit more, a bit different.\n\nOn top of that, images get 'burned' into your brain, and emerge into your consciousness at inappropraite times -- like when you're having sex for real with a real living person -- and then it seems that you are uninventive, unoriginal and a poor second best to the porn.\n\nTake my advice, keep the porn at extremely softcore and do not let even that become a habit.  Instead get out and try to get as much social interaction as possible -- work, find a cure for cancer, have as much sex as you can.\n\nThe moment when you do not 'own' your own sex acts is a particularly sad point indeed.\n\nGet out man.  Now -- while the going's good...
It sounds like your throat is closed while you sing and you're pushing air through your vocal chords without allowing the sound to resonate. \n\nOne little trick that will help a lot. When you sing, physically try to open up the back of your throat. It takes a bit off practise but it really improves the timber and warmth of your voice. To know what it physically feels like try this... Yawn....notice how the fleshy part at the back of the roof of you mouth goes up? That's how it should be while you sing...especially for sounds where you tend to naturally close your throat like 'eeeeeee' or 'ooooooo'.\n\nBefore trying to go for 'Volume', let yourself feel the vibrations of sound in your mouth. Your mouth is like a natural 'speaker box'. If you feel the vibrations at the back of the throat, you're closing your throat...open up until you feel the sound vibrating on the roof of your mouth.\nAnd of course....breath from the diaphragm meaning use that huge muscle under your lungs to control your breathe. When you breathe in, your belly should expand and that muscle should be used to control the exhalation of breathe.\n\nMake an effort to enunciate clearly, especially the final consonants of words...and extra especially at the end of long drawn out words which end with a consonant. It will help improve the clarity and tempo of your performance and will generally help make your performance more polished and 'tight'. Good luck! \n\nMost importantly, don't just sing the words and the notes. Sing the SONG. If you do not have a personal connection with the song, everytime you sing it... you're just trying to get through it... and in that...there is no music.
I don't know specifically but there is a site called The comatorium... There they have everything. Just search it in the forum. It's a forum dedicated to the mars volta.

"Are you sure that's the name? I'm not coming up with anything. imdb.com has a record of ""Spirit of Love"" but it's from Hong Kong not Taiwan. try summarizing it or spelling out the chinese name for it. My mother is a fanatic for these long chinese/korean/japanese long dramas. Maybe I'll recognize it if I get more details."
Producers don't buy ideas! You can't even get them copyrighted. You need an outline of each idea, what its about, the characters outline, how the idea story begins, developes and ends. You will then need an agent. If the idea is good enough the agent & you go before a panel at the studio and you have 5 minutes to pitch your idea from memory. If they like it and want you to rewrite it (usually as a script) you get $50,000 to develop it. You really need to take a screenwriting course at a community college. Its more involved than you think.
yes
Because as you got older you became more mature and it no longer took bright coloured, fun cartoon characters with silly plotlines to keep you entertained.

ACE, finally!  The bottom three were Chris, Ace & Paris.
I have no idea what the astrological answer is, but my mother was a Libra (9/24) and my father was a Taurus (5/8). They married when she was 13 and he 21 (we're talking way back in the day, things like that happened more often. They eloped. Lived in respective homes and told no one of marraige for a year, they were afraid to!)\nAnyway, my main point, they had been married for 62 years when my dad passed away.\nThere was a good match for them, so it sounds like Taurus and Libra can swing it, to me!

"In Rooster and Dog compability\nThis is not one of the most-favored unions. While you may gain, Rooster, because the Dog is a loyal and loving partner, you worry the Dog to Death with some of your daring maneuvers. Suddenly, you both find it difficult to relax together. You tend peck, and your mate growls and snaps in defense, when you disagree. If you have similar goals, you can gain financially. \nwhile in libra pises compability\nThese two Signs together combine their heads and their hearts to solve all problems -- a winning combination. The best decisions are made with both the emotions and the intellect; this relationship tends to be extremely flexible and progressive. When problems occur, however, the communication breaks down between Libra and Pisces. Libra, who can at times be mentally manipulative, may give Pisces """"the silent treatment."""" In this partnership there's always an undercurrent of friction but neither partner will ever truly be the leader. Although they may disagree often, their differences of opinion don't last long. Their only real trouble may result from their tendency to slow down to the point of stopping when they get together."

Yes, I think Chloe deserved it. I think Santino was way too out there in his designs and much to stubborn when it came to interpreting what the judges wanted from the challenges, which ultimately gives an idea as to how he would work with clients. Daniel was good and had very refreshing designs. However, his inexperience shined through at the fashion show. Chloe was the strongest out of all three.

"There was a competition to cross the English Channel doing only the breaststroke. \n\nThe three women who entered the race were a brunette, a redhead and a blonde. After approximately 14 hours, the brunette staggered up on the shore and was declared the fastest breaststroker.\n\nAbout 40 minutes later, the redhead crawled up onto the shore and was declared the second place finisher. \n\nNearly 4 hours after that, the blonde finally came ashore and promptly collapsed in front of the worried onlookers.\n\nWhen the reporters asked why it took her so long to complete the race, she replied, ""I don't want to sound like I'm a sore loser, but I think those two other girls were using their arms.""\n\nAnother one!\n\nA Blonde suspects her boyfriend of cheating on her, so She goes out and buys a gun.\n\nShe goes to his apartment unexpectedly and sure enough, she opens the door and finds him in the arms of a redhead.\n\nWell, the blond is angry, She opens her purse to take out the gun but as she does so, she is overcome with grief. She takes the gun and puts it to her head.\n\nThe boyfriend yells ""No, honey, don't do it.""\n\nThe blond replies ""Shut up, you're next."""

I worked overseas with a guy from South Africa and he basically said that there are big problems there, great tracts of land in dis-repair and large ghettos, where black and white have to live.  Basically because after Apartheid lots of people lost their jobs.  Probably the same thing that would happen in the US if all the Mexican/Hispanics wouldn't do menial labor, and charged us for years of working like that.  The tourist/port sections are still OK because of the infusion of cash they get, but he described it as the country tax section as messed up and they were not able to support their own infrastructure.

"I like that movie. I think that it was shot without color on purpose because the setting of the movie is in the Victorian era, and even though it was 1980 or near there when filmed I think they were trying to put the audience in the mood, making it more ""realistic"", more like a documentary of John Merrick's life. As for being poorly shot, I don't know."

THEN the next day you will open your mail and find about 600 junk spam messages, which you will NEVER get rid of. I've managed to get mine down to about 200 a day.

"I prefer a staff.  I'm too clumsy for a lightsaber...I'd just end up hurting myself.  A wand is extremely tempermental, if not handled correctly, and I suspect I'd blow things up a lot more often than not.  A staff, on the other hand, has three things going for it:\n\n1. It looks cool, in a ""don't mess with me, I'm a mountain man"" kind of way.\n2. It can be used to beat people without killing them, even aside from its magical content.\n3. Finally, the word ""Staff"" sounds way cooler and tougher than ""wand"" (which sounds like something a magical fairy would carry) and ""light saber"" (which sounds a little too much like the fruity, ring-shaped pocket candy)."

They skinned a rabbit and snuck up on the blonde, put the guts behind her and ran back to the campsite. Three minutes later they heard a scream. \n\nThen they waited another half an hour and the blonde came back, sweating. She said, ""I had to poop so hard I pooped my guts out. But thanks to God and these two fingers, I stuffed them back in."""
Geez, that's screwed up.  Mandisa is EASILY in the top half of the remaining contestants based on SINGING.  Ace, Pickler, and Bucky especially, should have been gone before Mandisa.  WOW, looks like America sees that either she's black or fat and decides to not vote for her?  This is definitely not a singing competition.
Bugs definitely. Mickey is so feminine  its pathetic .plus Bugs is a deviant mastermind he doesn't handle things as trivial as mice he has Fudd handle the pest control.

"Its to do with intellect. A ""nerd"" or ""geek"" (Americanisms, Phtoo!) is an intellectual who has achieved a state of interest in something other than sports and sex. In the case of Science Fiction those who are challenged by anything more complicated than basic needs are not interested because they have to work to hard to ""get it"". Its just that its an exciting genre through conceptual stimulation. And the ""Down"" that comes from those who consider themselves above it through their own physical beauty, prowess or popularity is really a reflection of their own shallowness. Don't let the In crowd spoil your fun Science Fiction allows access to creative places like no other concept."

I am just thinking faces that might work as an elven face structure.  Very Triangular and fragle hair.\n\nI am thinking about a Link to the past.  Or the Original Zelda.  I know that David Bowie would at least make a good Gannon?  I know that would not be typical but seeing Gannon as a dark elf that is search of a triforce power makes me think of Labyrinth.

"Mischa Barton has developed an extensive filmography and theatrical resume that will surely make her one of the most sought-after young actresses of her generation. Her feature film debut occurred in 1998 with the critically lauded Sundance favorite Lawn Dogs (1997) opposite Sam Rockwell. Her hailed performance was followed by Pups (1999), a modern day version of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) for filmmaker Ash (Bang). She has since racked up key roles in the 1999 Blockbusters The Sixth Sense (1999) with Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, and Notting Hill (1999), with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.\n\nBarton has subsequently completed work on an additional five features. They include Lost and Delirious (2001) opposite Piper Perabo for Lions Gate and Julie Johnson (2001) with Courtney Love and Lili Taylor; both of which premiered at Sundance. She was also seen in Skipped Parts (2000) with Jennifer Jason Leigh and Drew Barrymore.\n\nAt age nine, Barton began her promising career in New York Theater with a lead role in Tony Kushner's ""Slavs!"" She soon segued into the lead role of Emma Hatrick in James Lapine's 'Twelve Dreams' at the renowned Lincoln Center. Among her varied stage credits are 'Where the Truth Lies' and 'One Flea Spare', both of which took place at the New York Shakespeare Festival.\n\nNo stranger to television, Barton had a short-term role playing the character of Lilly Benton Montgomery on ""All My Children"" (1970) in 1996. She also portrayed the title role of Frankie alongside Joan Plowright in the recent Showtime feature Frankie & Hazel (2000) (TV) for producer Barbra Streisand's Barwood Films.

I totally agree.  Loved him when I was growing up, but he thinks of himself as being a great entertainer when he actually isn't.  His features are all full of cheesy jingles and sound effects (and I wish he would stop using the same old music at the end of every hour - he could fit in another tune!)\n\nHe sucks up so much as well - every guest is wonderful and amazing. I was disgusted to realise he earns £440,000 per year for putting on the same old formulaic show day after day.\n\nCutting edge? I think not.
i like weezer their song beverly hills that what i like
The movie was decent but had several pitfalls. It takes over an hour before you see Kong. The action sequences are significently longer then they need to be. Jackson went way longer then he needed to. \n\nYou probably want to wait till they are 14 or 15. The scenes with the natives are pretty dicey and can easily scare young teenagers. Also, there are a bunch of scenes that are startling including dinosaurs and massive insects. \n\nBut for all its action, it does have a connection between naomi Watts (sp?) and Kong that you don't see in most action films. My ex-girlfriend actually started crying when they starting to strafe Kong. \n\nAlso Jack Black doesn't say or do anything funny in the movie whatsoever. That was a let down. \n\nGive it a year or two before showing them and be willing to sit down for 3+ hours.

"Wow, I thought everyone was over Avril at this point. *sigh* Okay, going back a few years here, so some of this may be wrong. \n\nAs I recall, she used to say she would never be in a movie. This was way back when like..she wore ties, her hair was pinstraight every day, and it was her natural color. This is when every teenage girl & guy fell in love with her, myself included. I was a diehard fan for a long time. Let Go was amazing. She had such an impact on many people at the time, 2002, 2003ish. Then she faded. Then she came back with Under My Skin. I was among those that counted the days, were the very FIRST to get new songs. I remember waiting forever, and finally, Don't Tell Me was leaked. I remember so distinctly, it was late January of 2004 and we got that song along with another clip called Daydream, which didn't make the album and pissed me off times 10.\n\nThis is when her image grew more girly. She stopped with the tie thing and shi t. She wore normal clothes and I still loved her. Then..she dyed her hair for like the first time ever? I'm not sure. And the color was pee blonde. That's literally what it was. It was so ugly. Her band members were dropping like flies and Jesse Colburn left at this time because they broke up. She started dating Deryck Whibley aka Pitbull Gnome Cow Midget Boy. =D Blah blah shi t happened. Then Evan Taubenfeld left her band (my favorite) and I faded away from her. She seemed to be getting uglier for some reason (I blame Deryck) and that was pretty much the end. She faded for like...almost a year. Then she signed that modeling contract and did Over the Hedge.\n\nNow, I think she's gorgeous whatever she does. Soo...after me ranting about how I used to be obsessed with her. I miss the brown hair, aka ""the old Avril."" Simply because that was like..her prime. And it takes me back to a wonderful year of my own life, so naturally it's my favorite. I have such a bad case of nostalgia that after she ""grew up,"" I hated it, even though I grew up too and that's when I got over her. It freaked me out that everything was changing. Not to mention I thought it was hideous. She like completely changed herself and reinvented herself every year or so. So yeah haha. Congratulations to anyone who's made it this far reading about Avril Lavigne. =D"

Duke Edwards\nFollowing a stint in military service, drummer/singer Eddie 'Duke' Edwards studied at Berklee in Boston between 1958-1961. Joining the north-eastern US chitlin circuit, he later travelled up to Montreal where he met jazz musician Sun Ra. During his 3-year stint working with Sun Ra, he appeared on the soundtrack album 'Grain of Salt'. In 1964, he was introduced to booking agent Ron Scribner and together they formed a company to promote local talent in Toronto. One of the bands they worked with was R&B outfit, Jon and Lee & The Checkmates. Edwards became the group's manager and musical director, as well as provider of material, composing the track, 'Pork Chops', which graced the b-side of the band's lone single, 'Bring It Down Front'. In mid-1967, he parted company with the group and returned to Montreal where he worked as musical director for the World Fair. He subsequently formed Duke Edwards & The Young Ones, an ambitious experimental jazz band that signed to US label Prestige and recorded 3 albums' worth of music. Following the release of a lone album, 'Introducing Duke Edwards & The Young Ones' in mid-1968 and opening for Jimi Hendrix and Aretha Franklin among others, he signed a solo deal with Polydor Records. Edwards subsquently formed a new band, The Cycle to record the intended album for Polydor but an offer to join Rhinoceros in August 1969 resulted in the project being scrapped. Edwards remained with Rhinoceros until the summer of 1970 when he dropped out to pursue other projects. He currently heads the Louis Armstrong Foundation in New Orleans and is working on the restoration of the largest surviving plantation in the American South, the 'Evergreen Plantation'.\n\nYou can try to contact The Louis Armstrong Foundation in New Orleans to see if he is still active in the foundation.

i have a better idea. go to your local public library. many have lots of cds. have them check with other libraries in your area.\n\nif they don't have what you want have them check http://www.firstsearch.org/ through there they can order cds from every library in the world. don't try to get an account at firstserch.org you have to get the username and password from your library since that is where you will have to return the cds.\n\nafter you get the cds load them into your computer and use windows media player to rip the songs off of the cds. this is so easy it's almost not fun. :) it only takes a few minutes per cd.\n\nthen return the cds back to the library and you're done.\n\ni do this all the time and it don't cost me anything.\n\ni'm fortunate enough to have a friend that gave me 2gb of space and unlimited data transfer so i simply uploaded them to my account and listen to them there.\n\nif you don't want to do that go to http://www.mp3raid.com and get some codes.

Well, there are two different topics here:\n\n1) The music creation / artistic part of making music\n2) The music business itself (i.e., lawyers, labels,\ncontracts, profits, royalties, paychecks, etc).\n\nWell, obviously, creating the music is the rewarding part emotionally.  You get to create something from your imagination and also something that reflects your personality and give it to public listening.  This is the part that is also the most fun portion.  It should not be tied down by business rules.  But, in many cases it is.\n\nThe music business is, as is all other money making industries, just a business solely interested in making money.  So, as long as the music is popular and it continues to make money, that artist is at the top.  If that stops, then the artist becomes a has-been.  If the artist was industry created (like so many artists of today), then that person becomes a nobody as fast as they became a somebody.  Today, the music business is almost solely focused on piracy without regard to anything else.  They are so entranced by this issue that they have forgotten that they really need to provide quality music to the listening public.\n\nSo, because of the piracy issue, the music of today is really not that great.  Much of today's music is primarily created in the producer's mind and by the producers... hiring people solely to fill the roles (just as as a film might hire an actor).  In the past, a group of musicians would get together and create music and then be discovered.  Today, it's just the opposite.  Producers create the music up front and then find someone with the look and a reasonably decent voice to fill the role.  Rarely is commercial pop music actually created by talented musicians.  It's now almost solely created by a producer who then hires musicians to play the music to what was already written (requiring only musical instrument skill, but little, if any, writing talent).\n\nThe contractual part of the music industry is where most new artists get bitten hard.  If you're undiscovered, then they rope you in to signing a horrible contract with small amount of pay and lots of concert work.  So, you get little in the way of pay, but you do a lot of work for them (that you are contractually obligated to provide).  So, if you ever get into the position of signing a record contract, be careful to read the verbiage exactly (and have a lawyer that you have hired go over it with you).  Don't blindly sign it simply because you want a record deal.

Awwww, you just made me remember the good times.*sighs* I was the number one fan of b2k..until they broke up that is. I think they should get back together without omarion. Sure he was the lead singer but I really think raz or boogie will be able to fix the singing part up. Dont you think? They have fizz for most of the rapping so I think its all good. Man, I used to love them thou, Omarion was my top fave*still is* and raz came in next for my fave. Man his lips look so damn kissable lol. If they make a comeback without o i think they will do good, omarion might even come back if they do good without him, who knows.*signs*the good ole days lol

"""Evanescence is currently working on their second album, the title of which isn't yet known. The album has progressed slowly for a number of reasons, but perhaps chiefly because of Amy Lee's desire to allow the creative process to fully take its course and not rush production. Besides that, other distractions have included other band members' side projects, health problems concerning guitarist Terry Balsamo and the controversy revolving around the dismissal of their former manager. Lee stated on EvBoard that Evanescence's new album will be wrapping up in March 2006. It should be on store shelves in late summer, with the tentative release date rumored to be August 22nd. However, recently the wife of Rocky Gray (the band's drummer) has posted news on another fan board, stating that the release will be pushed back to sometime in September, allegedly because ""Wind-Up [the band's current record label] wants to make a few changes to the upcoming single.""\n\n\nAfter a long period of stasis, the Evanescence website was updated with a short piece of news. The news read ""Evanescence is in the studio working on new music. Check back to the site for more info as it becomes available."" """

He asked, ""What are all those clocks?""\n\nSt. Peter answered, ""Those are Lie-Clocks. Everyone on Earth has a Lie-Clock. Every time you lie the hands on your clock will move.""\n\n""Oh,"" said Rumsfeld, ""whose clock is that?"" ""That's Mother Teresa's. The hands have never moved, indicating that she never told a lie."" ""Incredible,"" said Rumsfeld. ""And whose clock is that one?"" St. Peter responded, ""That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have moved twice, telling us that Abe told only two lies in his entire life.""\n\n""Where's Bush's clock?"" asked Rumsfeld.\n\n""Bush's clock is in Jesus' office. He's using it as a ceiling fan.""\n\n\nA man absolutely hated his wife's cat and decided to get rid of him one day by driving him 20 blocks from his home and leaving him at the park. As he arrived home, the cat was walking up the driveway.\n\nThe next day he decided to drive the cat 40 blocks away. He put the beast out and headed home. Driving back up his driveway, there was the cat!\n\nHe kept taking the cat further and further, and the cat would always beat him home. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right until he reached what he thought was a safe distance from his home and left the cat there.\n\nHours later the man calls home to his wife: ""Jen, is the cat there?""\n\n""Yes"", the wife answers, ""why do you ask?""\n\nFrustrated, the man answered, ""Put the little bastard on the phone, I'm lost and need directions.""\n\n\nA farmer who's been involved in a terrible road accident with large truck ended up in court fighting for a big compensation claim.\n\n""I understand you're claiming damages for the injuries you're supposed to have suffered?"" stated the counsel for the insurance company.\n\n""Yes, that's right,"" replied the farmer, nodding his head.\n\n""You claim you were injured in the accident, yet I have a signed police statement that says that when the attending police officer asked you how you were feeling, you replied, 'I've never felt better in my life.' Is that the case?""\n\n""Yeah, but..."" stammered the farmer.\n\n""A simple yes or not will suffice,"" counsel interrupted quickly.\n\n""Yes,"" Replied the farmer.\n\nThen it was the turn of the farmer's counsel to ask him questions.\n\n""Please tell the court the exact circumstance of events following the accident when you made your statement of health,"" his lawyer said.\n\n""Certainly,"" replied the farmer. ""After the accident my horse was thrashing around with a broken leg and my poor old dog was howling in pain. This cop comes along, takes one look at my horse and shoots him dead. ""Then he goes over to my dog, looks at him and shoots him dead too. Then he come straight over to me and asked  me how I was feeling. ""Now, what the heck would I have said to him?"""

The theme song for Half & Half is sung by the gospel singer Tonex and Shanice Wilson (married to Flex Alexander of One on One)..... Actor and comedian FLEX ALEXANDER of the UPN sitcom One on One, and his wife, R&B singer SHANICE, enjoy an outing in Los Angeles with their 1-year-old daughter, IMANI SHEKINAH, their first child. Shanice was in the studio recording the One on One theme song with gospel signer Tonex when she went into labor, and shortly after she finished recording, the baby was born. She is working on a new album.

"That is so funny. For some reason, Bear is a show that once you sit down and see it on, you can't stop watching. When I was in school I remember being home for days off and stuff. There was nothing on TV except preschool shows, since that is what is on at that time. So I started watching Bear, it's a really cute show, for all ages, I must say. Anyhow, after I saw the show, the songs stuck in my head for like a week. I would try to go to bed and I would start hearing ""What's in the mail today..."" It was crazy.\n\nOK, sorry. To answer your question, I do like the song. I like the mail song too. My brothers gave me the CD soundtrack a gag gift once. Try to get it out of your head after you hear it on a CD ;-)\n\n\nOh and I forgot to mention. When I was younger, the Lamb Chop song was really popular. Then the Barney song was also popular. All these type shows seem to have songs that will never leave your head."

Well, she is going to have his babies. Twins at that , at least that what was in the magazines.  SHe looks like she may have boys by the way she is carring.  If she does get married it would have to be through love and being in love and not lust.  IF they love each other they should get married but not for the wrong reasons.  She would have to explain to the kids one day why that the kids have her last name rather then his.  If she marries him, or maybe she is already married to him, in secrete from the public.  If she is married to him he can claim his kids as his with the last name rather then her going single raising the kids.
Kenshin... he's cute and funny
i agree...this kind of language reduces people and sounds rather idiotic. i think it is especially annoying when kids talk this way or when white people talk like that. its just annoying and rude...\nyou can disagree with me, but thats just my opinion!!
Doesn't seem that intelligent?  Have ever seen an interview with him? I don't even know you but I would venture to guess he could talk circles around you.\n\nYes, all of his actions as Marilyn Manson are designed to garner as much as attention as possible.
Oh my God. I swear he is SO yummy! Isnt he? God, have you seen him lately! Wow! \n\nAnd his lyrics. I swear I just want to hug the guy and take care of him. That sounds insane, I know, but everything he has been through just makes me sad. I just want to take care of him. I am just pulled toward him. I dont know why. \n\nIm not stalking the guy or anything but I am very drawn to him. I just love the guy!

I say no, because as music changes, instruments will have to evolve as well, and music is always changing. Also, if a new genre were to be created, or a new take on a genre were to occur, then that could possibly trigger the invention of a new instrument. Interesting question though, thank you!
I certainly hope NOT!  Those LA street gangs ruined many predomintly black neighborhoods, destroyed lives of thousands of young black men.  Those street gangs contributed to the downhill slide of many black American families and spread their poison into many American cities.\nTheir poison was drugs. Crack cocaine and weed were their main means of poisoning America.\n\nLet's hope the crips and bloods finally killed each other off.\n\nBut saddly, street gangs now come in all colors and ethnicities.  Crips and bloods were just  more noticible gangs of thugs.\n\nGang banging is to be shunned.  Saddly it is romanticized and made glamours by the raunchy hip-hop rappers many teens seem to idolize.  \n\nLeave that deathstyle alone and you'll grow up much happier!

I named it the best film of 2005.  Here was my snippet for the Top Ten List:\n\nMismarketed, misunderstood, and mishandled.  This would be a surprise to see atop anyone's list.  Yet Stay is a masterpiece of a film.  An intricate puzzle that goes far beyond Sixth Sense-ian twists to give profound insights into life, death, guilt, and human existance.  Not only is it the best of the year, it's one of the best films ever made.

"The song is called ""Someone To Watch Over Me"".\n\nTechnically, all of last night's songs were sung by Rod Stewart.  However, this is because he re-did it on one of his recent albums.\n\nThe song was originally written by George and Ira Gershwin, as part of the musical ""Crazy For You"".  Over time, it has been sung by many artists, including Frank Sinatra and Sting."

Yes!! Finally...another Sami Yusuf fan.  I absolutely love his songs.  They are so warm and amazing.  My favorites are Muallim and My Ummah (from his new album).  His voice is so beautiful and the words to the songs are so perfect that the combination makes me want to cry.  It's so great the way he promotes Islam through singing, a medium that many people understand and he does it without sounding like an extremist.
"There isn't really an answer to this question. The town is never mentioned in the movie, only in the books it is mentioned that she lives near Butterfield. However, Butterfield does not exist. In some publicity material Baum had for his 1904-05 comic page, Dorothy writes a letter to her old friends and the address given is ""Uncle Henry's Farm Near Topeka."" In the book Return to Oz, Dorthy lives outside Franklin, which does exist. There is a tourist attraction in Liberal, Kansas that called Dorothy's house, which is a relocated farmhouse built in 1907, along with the original model of the house used in the film and a collection of memorabilia. Hope this helps, although there is no real answer"

The Munsters acted like a normal family.  They did not see that they were so different, except for Marilyn who was the ugly duckling of the family.  They were honest and loving and just couldn't unbderstand other people's reactions to them.\n\nIt probably would have been a riot to have befriended them and been their neighbours.
Personally i think he should of  chose Goldie because she was the only one who seem to be mature enough to handle a crazy man like him, yet she still had a fun, wild, and crazy side. She had all the qualities that he may have needed. Hoopz was a good one but as i thought she wasent ready, NY was too in love to have just been meeting him at the start of the show and i thought she may have been more of a headache in the long run. She was very self centered just as Hottie was. Really i dont know how you can be so in love with someone who has various women at a house whom he kisses makes out with and does all these other things with when he wanted. I'm not sure if Flav is really looking for love i think he wants a playmate.

Not on the show.

Let me make it clear that you will not be able to check out their tags page, where they house all their anime links and such, without being a member of the community.\n\nIf you don't like, I'd go to gotlurk.net.

Their site has recent manga, and it's not hard to learn how to use IRC if you go to their forums.  Once in their forums, head to their support page, and it'll teach you all you have to do.  After you get yourself prepared, you'll easily be able to copy and paste the code for the manga into the IRC chat, and you'll be able to download it to your own computer.  I'm POSITIVE that Gotlurk.net/#lurk has Fruits Basket.  If you wish to choose this direction, you'll need the IRC client, MIRC.  You can find it at MIRC.com.  Believe me, it may sound complicated, but I now have all 42 volumes of DBZ, and it took me an hour to download 'em.\n\nI know it used to be available on directmanga.net, but I'm not sure if it even exists anymore.  If you don't like any of the ideas I've given you, you should try to search for, ""Fruits Basket Manga Scanlations"" on yahoo or google.\n\nI'm sorry if this is too confusing.  I'm gonna go searching for some Fruits Basket manga for you, too.  Good luck!"

I'm big Bob Marley fan, but I don't think he be the number one selling artist.  He probably would of made more great music, but his other albums would of not be selling as much as they do now.  Reason is that once he died he became a Reggae Icon and his music become more popular all over the world.

"Dammit, I used to have a book that told me absolutely everything about Star Trek and the Enterprise. Wish I still had it. I'm sure there is some Trekky website. \n\nI will look. You wait here for someone to give you a real answer.\n\n\nEnergize.\n\n\nI'm back -just like that. Isn't that amazing.\n\nStar dates were among hundreds of unexplained terms thrown into Star Trek by scriptwriters whose main objectives were plausibility, a space-poetical ring, and getting done by deadline.\n\nThe dates in the original show (1966-69) were of the form 0000.0 and were assigned pretty much at random, the producers merely keeping a list to avoid duplication. The numbers meant nothing at first but eventually it was agreed the units were roughly equivalent to earth days and the decimals were tenths thereof.\n\nIn Star Trek: The Next Generation things were more systematic. One production staffer was ""keeper of the star dates"" and parceled them out to the episode writers to avoid mixups. The numbers were of the form 40000.0, sometimes with two decimal places. The initial 4 was assigned arbitrarily, the second digit referred to the season, and the remaining three usually progressed from low to high over the course of the season. But everybody was still pretty vague on what the numbers meant in the context of the show.\n\nNot that star dates don't have a rationale. Something of the sort would certainly be required on an actual starship. We know from the theory of relativity that time is local, not universal. When a starship approaches the speed of light, time aboard it slows down from the perspective of us here on earth but continues to hum along at the usual rate for the passengers. Trying to use Earth time aboard the Enterprise would require abruptly speeding up the calendar every time Kirk had Scotty pour on the ions. Better to use ""ship time,"" that is, time as measured on the ship's own clocks. Ship date 1000.5 would mean noon (.5) on day 1000, presumably the thousandth day since the launching of the ship. ""Ship date"" doesn't sound as snappy as ""star date,"" which falsely suggests there is some universal ""star time"" (although see below), but I suppose we can allow for a little dramatic license.\n\nTrouble is, star dates don't follow this logical scheme. During the original series star dates ranged from 1312.4 to 5943.7--a span of 4,600 days, or about twelve and a half years. We know from the opening voiceover that the Enterprise was on a five-year mission. This means either that (1) Kirk and friends were running up some serious overtime, (2) there's more to star dates than meets the eye, or (3) nobody in the show gave the matter a moment's thought.\n\nThe real answer is obvious, but Bjo Trimble's Star Trek Concordance (1976), written with some input from producer Gene Roddenberry, gamely attempts to account for things by saying star dates are ""a function not only of time but of a ship's position in the galaxy and its velocity."" How mere mortals could cope with a timekeeping system of such breathtaking complexity is not explained.\n\nAnother problem is that several episodes in the original series took place only a star date or two apart, even though they seemingly cram in a lot more than 24 hours' worth of action. For example, ""What Little Girls Are Made Of"" begins on 2712.4, ""Miri"" on 2713.5, and ""Dagger of the Mind"" on 2715.1. The Concordance ventures the explanation that ""warp drive distorts time."" This suggests two things: first, star time is universal and not local (in fact the current assumption is that star dates are not peculiar to a given ship but are standard throughout the Federation); and second, inertial (e.g., earth) time would pass more slowly than ship's time, the opposite of what Einstein told us actually occurs. Bjo cheerfully concedes this is a little feeble but says it was the"

Well if you mean current festival that still takes place, has to be SxSW (South by Southwest) that takes place every March in Austin. It got its start back 1987.

Some stats:\n\nMusic\n• Showcasing Acts: 1493\n• Music Venues Participating: 64\n• Music Conference Participants: 10,821 (with band registrations 12,002)\n• Approximate Number of Music Media in Attendance: 2,176\n• Approximate Number of Music Trade Show Attendees: 13,500\n• Number of Music Trade Show Exhibitors: 192\n\nThe week prior to SXSW hosts a film festival that is not nearly as well known, but it also brings a lot of famous folks out to Austin.

It depends on whatever they are watching and the time of day they are watching T.V. For example violent shows or movies can cause kids to be violent. Shows that show leadership in a positive way can lead the child to be positive. T.V. is preferred to be watch during the day after homework has been completed and their chores are taking care of. When it comes to bedtime children should be sleeping instead of watching T.V.

Bad Day by Daniel Powter. I discovered this song nearly a year ago and have been infatuated with it ever since. I actually was one of the first people to hear of him in America because he was HUGE in France and I decided to have a listen. It really is a great song and I highly recommend the album. It's titled Daniel Powter and was released in 2005.

harmonics are really cool--i agree--the thing i like ilike about them is that they are outside the normal range of notes normally played on guitar--so a decent guitarist can really expand on what he,s trying to do with the limited range of notes usually played on guitar---they,re really cool when bent high or low with a whammy bar!!!

The Sopranos is finished after this upcoming season which begins March 12th.\n\nDavid Chase, creator and executive producer of the HBO hit series, assured critics Friday at the Television Critics Assn. winter press tour that he won't be coaxed back for more after the 20 episodes he is working on are completed. ""That will be the end"", Chase said. ""Definitely"".\n\nThe previous season of Sopranos was intended to be the final episodes, but HBO managed to lure Chase back for more. Twelve new episodes unspool in March, followed by the final eight episodes in January 2007. Chase even scotched the perennial speculation that HBO could produce a theatrical version of the show."

The moviemakers did put in more about their love than J.R.R. Tolkien did. Then again, they played up all the women characters more than Tolkein, and that's fine with me!
Trust me--my mom would guilt you into letting her win.  And if you won anyway, she'd get even.

"You should check out some old soul and funk music. Stuff like Marva Whitney and Lyn Collins from James Browns band, or the Isley Brothers, particularly the Brothers Isley record. You could check out Captain Beefheart if you dig weirder ""art rock"" music."
Did you see the movie called Made (Vince Vaughn)? There was a great scene where the stars are trying to get into a hot club and the bouncer lets Screech (Dustin Diamond) in before them. Classic.
Apparently it's a deep dark secret:\n\nA white scar runs up her left cheek. (She has had the scar since childhood but she hates to discuss it.) \n\nAnd they gossip about the origins of the mysterious scar on the left side of her face. Fey won't say how she got it except to mention that it happened during her childhood. \n\n“It’s a childhood injury that was kind of grim,” she said. “And it kind of bums my parents out for me to talk about it.”
There are no good rap songs.
Definetly. No matter what false alegations people have against him people who think for themselves and not just listen to what they read or hear will still support him and his music!

I love metal all types I love Iron maiden. I also like Korn, Slipknot, System of a Down, Killswitch Engage, God Forbid, Chimaira, Sepultura, and Static-x. Metal is often misunderstood.When I first got into metal my friends thought it was weird too but they got used to it. Just do whatever you want its your life not theirs.

"Birth name \nFrances Ethel Gumm \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNickname \nBaby Gumm \nMiss Showbusiness \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeight \n4' 11½"" (1.51 m) \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMini biography \nShe immediately attracted attention in such films as Pigskin Parade (1936), Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938) and Broadway Melody of 1938 (1937), but Judy Garland didn't truly become a star until she was cast in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Her performance as Dorothy won her a special Juvenile Oscar, and it was this role, of course, that gave her her most famous song, ""Over the Rainbow."" She then appeared in a long string of classic MGM musicals, including Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Easter Parade (1948) and several with her friend, Mickey Rooney. Unfortunately, the same studio that made her a star unwittingly made her a drug addict, providing her with amphetamines to keep her energy level high and her weight level down. This in turn kept her wide awake at night, unable to sleep, so she was given barbiturates to help her sleep. She soon couldn't live without these ""wonder drugs."" She also couldn't seem to live without a man, as she went through several affairs, often with older men, and by 1950 had been married twice, to bandleader David Rose and director Vincente Minnelli. She had a daughter, Liza Minnelli, with Vincente. All during this time her drug intake had increased dramatically, which led to increasingly erratic behavior and she often failed to show up on time at the studio. MGM eventually couldn't take it any more, and her contract was terminated in 1950. She divorced Minnelli the following year and married producer Sidney Luft. Luft, the father of her daughter Lorna Luft and son Joey Luft, took it upon himself to orchestrate her comeback with a series of very successful concert tours. He also produced the film A Star Is Born (1954), in which many feel she gave her greatest performance. By now she was concentrating on her career as a singer, which was winning her more legions of fans. She continued touring throughout the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in three more films and starring in her own television variety show in 1963, which had to be canceled after one season because the competition, ""Bonanza"" (1959), was too strong. She divorced Luft and married actor Mark Herron; she divorced him when she found out he was gay, and married disco manager Mickey Deans. Throughout this time, however, she still continued her dependency on prescription drugs, and finally the inevitable happened: on the night of June 22, 1969, she overdosed on barbiturates and died. Thousands mourned the world over. It was a sad way to end, but she has left a great legacy: her many films and recordings, as well as her children. Liza and Lorna are now singers as well, carrying on the family tradition.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIMDb mini-biography by \nTommy Peter \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMini biography \n""That Old Man River keeps rolling along"" was one of the many songs that Judy Garland recorded. She was born in the Upper Mississippi River town of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, where the Judy Garland Museum takes up an entire floor of the old grade school. A block away is the site of the home where Garland spent the first five years of her life. That spot is now occupied by a multiplex cinema in the town's only shopping center. Garland's father operated the only movie theater in Grand Rapids until he moved the family to California in 1927. Garland made her stage debut at that Grand Rapids theater with her two older sisters. In 1934 the Gumm Sisters performed in Chicago during the World's Fair there. "

"Operation Wrath of God and Operation Spring of Youth\n\nGolda Meir and the Israeli Defense Committee made a decision secretly authorizing the Mossad to track down and eliminate those responsible for the Munich massacre [25]. To this end the Mossad set up a number of special teams to locate and eliminate these terrorists, aided by the agency's stations in Europe [26].\n\nThe Israeli mission later became known as Operation Wrath of God or Mivtza Elohim[27]. Reeve quotes General Aharon Yariv — who, he writes, was the general overseer of the operation — as stating that after Munich the Israeli government felt it had no alternative but to exact justice.\n\n    We had no choice. We had to make them stop, and there was no other way ... we are not very proud about it. But it was a question of sheer necessity. We went back to the old biblical rule of an eye for an eye ... I approach these problems not from a moral point of view, but, hard as it may sound, from a cost-benefit point of view. If I’m very hard-headed, I can say, what is the political benefit in killing this person? Will it bring us nearer to peace? Will it bring us nearer to an understanding with the Palestinians or not? In most cases I don’t think it will. But in the case of Black September we had no other choice and it worked. Is it morally acceptable? One can debate that question. Is it politically vital? It was.[28]\n\nBenny Morris writes that, using information from ""turned"" PLO personnel and friendly European intelligence services, the Mossad compiled its target list, placing at the top Wael 'Aadel Zwaiter, a suspected member of Black September and the official PLO representative in Italy, who was shot and killed on October 16. Abu Iyad, the PLO's deputy-chief and chief of intelligence until his death at the hands of an Abu Nidal operative in 1991, later claimed that Zwaiter was not connected to Black September and had ""fiercely opposed ... all forms of terrorism"" (Abu Iyad 1983). Zwaiter's death was followed by non-fatal letter bomb attacks on PLO representatives in Algeria and Libya, on Palestinians in Bonn and Copenhagen, and on a Red Cross representative in Stockholm, writes Morris.\n\nOn December 8, the PLO's representative in Paris, Mohammad Hamshari was killed by a radio-detonated bomb under his desk. Over the next three months, writes Morris, four PLO, PFLP, and PFLP-GC operatives were killed in Cyprus, Greece, and Paris.\n\nOn April 9, 1973, Israel launched Operation Spring of Youth, a joint Mossad-IDF operation in Beirut. The targets were Mohammad Yusuf al-Najjar (Abu Yusuf), head of Fatah's intelligence arm, which ran Black September, according to Morris; Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's so-called Western Sector, which controlled PLO action inside Israel; and Kamal Nassir, the PLO spokesman. A group of Sayeret commandos were taken in nine missile boats and a small fleet of patrol boats to a deserted Lebanese beach, before driving in two cars to downtown Beirut, where they killed Najjar, Adwan and Nassir. Two further detachments of commandos blew up the PFLP's headquarters in Beirut and a Fatah explosives plant. The leader of the commando team that conducted the operations was Ehud Barak.\n\nOn June 28, 1973, the Algerian-born director of operations for Black September in Europe, Mohammad Boudia, was killed by a car bomb in Paris.\n\nOn July 21, 1973, in the so-called Lillehammer affair, a team of Mossad agents killed Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan man unrelated to the Munich attack, in Lillehammer, Norway, after an informant mistakenly said Bouchiki was Ali Hassan Salameh, the head of Force 17 and a Black September operative. Five Mossad agents, including two women, were captured by the Norwegian authorities, while others managed to slip away[29]. The five were convicted of the killing and imprisoned, but were released and returned to Israel in 1975.\n\nThe Mossad later found Ali Hassan Salameh in Be"

Yes. However it depends on what you hit at the bottom. If your head hits a rock, definitely. True story: A man parachuted from 5000 feet and his chutes didn't open. He landed feet first (must have been a really soft surface) and walked away. The only difference was that he was an inch and a half shorter.  So you just never know, but a fifty foot fall could kill you depending upon what you land on and how you land.

Based on the hit musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the tale tells the story of a disfigured musical genius who haunts the catacombs beneath the Paris Opera, waging a reign of terror over its occupants. When he falls fatally in love with the lovely Christine, the Phantom devotes himself to creating a new star for the Opera--exerting a strange sense of control over the young soprano as he nurtures her extraordinary talents.

I've had this happen to me twice. Tell them up front that they are annoying you. Don't go into too much detail, because it can really hurt their feelings. Just tell them that you need some time alone and time with other people, and that you feel trapped. If you see him/her walking around, dont talk to him/her. That will make them think you like them.  Just ignore them. That should work.
What's the question?

Every Zodiac sign has traits that the people born under don't like. Interestingly enough, if you ponder these traits, you'll find them pretty close to the mark.\nMy daughter is a Cancer sign, and she exhibits the artistic, intuitive traits. Also she's protective of her friends, going so far as to stick up for them in the schools she's attended.\nMyself, I'm a Capricorn, and I'm surprised to find my personality traits are remarkably true-to-form, even though I don't follow astrology daily.\nConcentrate on the strengths opf your sign; shrewdness, cautious, intuitive, imaginative...what's wrong with those?

This trend actually started from Disney.Disney found out that eliminating one finger could give a more plastic movement to the figure's hands.Also it is much more easy to draw because you have a less complexe pattern to follow within the limited space required for a cartoon's hand.\n   Then the trend was passed on from Disney to other creators of the era including the great Osamu Tezuka who made his astro-boy character with four fingers only.Suprisingly it worked so well that even today's characters such as the simpsons have one finger less!

So is the rest of the house. \n\nHe takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.

Diagnosed with cancer nine years ago, Mr. T. has never once asked God to remove the disease. Instead, he has only prayed that God would give him the strength to endure it so he can bless other people. Like Job in the Bible, Mr. T. has come to a place where he looks to God and says, “I trust and praise you in the midst of all this.” Not exactly what you would expect from a Hollywood celebrity.

"Clay is an amazing singer who has decided to use his fame to help others.  He has founded the Bubel/Aiken Foundation to help special needs children with inclusion.  He has traveled all over the world as an ambassador for UNICEF rather than playing the clubs to get in the magazines.  He made a decision to use his fame to help others, and I say BRAVO!\n\nThe whole ""homesexual"" thing...who cares yes or no?  I don't think he is because he says he's not, but even if he is...so what?  People who harp on this are bigots and idiots.  And you'll get NO APOLOGY from me for saying so.  Have you noticed that the same people who say ""he's gay"" will defend someone else for being gay?  What hypocrites!  I say WHO CARES?  I'm not looking to date Clay, just to enjoy his beautiful voice!\n\nHis new CD is coming out this summer, and I for one can't wait to buy it.  He has one of the truest voices out there.  He reminds me of Barry Manilow, singing songs that make people happy.  Barry was ridiculed by the critics and ""the cool"" too...but four decades later, he's still making number one CDs.  I hope Clay can have a career with such longevity.  Barry never cared about the critics...Clay shouldn't either."
I'm thinking it's the Everclear version. They had a video when that song came out, and are the most popular band of the three, which would mean more air time.

"Little Johnny was 7 years old and like other boys his age rather \ncurious. \n\nHe had been hearing quite a bit about 'making out' from the older boys, and he wondered what it was and how it was done. \n\nOne day he took his question to his mother, who became rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his older sister and her boyfriend. \n\nThis he did. The following morning, Johnny described EVERYTHING to his mother. \n\n""Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her. I figured 'Sis must be getting sick, because her face started looking funny. \n\nHe must have thought so too, because he put his hand inside her blouse to feel her heart, just the way the doctor would. Except he's not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have trouble finding her heart. I guess he was getting sick too, because pretty soon both of them started panting and getting all out of breath. \n\nHis other hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. \n\nAbout this time 'Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when her fever started. I knew it was a fever, because Sis told him she felt really hot. \n\nFinally, I found out what was making them so sick......-a big eel ;had gotten inside his pants somehow. It just jumped out of his pants and stood there, about 10 inches long, honest, anyway he grabbed it in one hand to keep it from getting away. \n\nWhen Sis saw it, she got really scared-her eyes got big, and her mouth fell open, and she started calling out to God and stuff like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever seen; I should tell her about the ones down at the lake by our house! \n\nAnyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting its head off. All of a sudden she grabbed it with both hands and held it tight while he took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's head to keep it from biting again. \n\nSis lay back and spread her legs so she could get a scissor-lock on it and he helped by lying on top of the eel. The eel put up a hell of a fight. \n\nSis started groaning and squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them. \n\nAfter a while they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her boyfriend got up, and sure enough, they killed the eel. I knew because it just hung there, limp, and some of its insides were hanging out. \n\nSis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging and kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead! It jumped straight up and started to fight again. \n\nI guess eels are like cats- they have nine lives or something. This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill it by sitting on it. After about a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I knew it was dead, because I saw Sis's boyfriend peel its skin off and flush it down the toilet."
"I didn't like it as much as I thought I would.  They did some things I didn't agree with at all.\n\nI was mad about Xavier dying, no matter what the clip at the end of the credits showed.  I was mad as Scott dying.  I could see him being a tragic figure for a long time, but I think he would have pulled out of it if given a chance.  I think they over-did pretty much all of the fight scenes to make up for a weak plot, and the emotional scenes, with the exception of the one where Rogue leaves and the part right after Xavier died, fell pretty flat.  I greatly dislike that Rogue actually took the cure, no matter that the end shows evidence that it's not as permanent as the humans thought.  I thought that she'd turn up during the last fight scene and drain Magneto or Phoenix.  I dislike that she came back to Bobby, too.  Let Kitty have him.  And I thought the ending with all of its sunshine and happiness was a little too trite.  I also do NOT like Storm as the leader of the X-Men.\n\nOkay, now for what I did like.  I liked the Rogue and Wolverine scene where she leaves, obviously, because that rang true for me.  I actually liked their explanation of how Jean survived and how Phoenix came into being.  That part was better than the comics or the cartoons, in my opinion.  I liked that they gave the background of Jean in film rather than dialogue alone.  I liked most of the fight scenes as being well done by the actors, and I liked that Wolverine killed Jean because I'm a sadistic person who never liked Jean in the first place and thought she was playing Wolverine a bit too much in the last too movies.  I'm protective of Wolverine.  I also liked Beast, pretty much through the whole movie.  Loved him.  Laughed especially hard at ""Oh, h@*&, you get the point!""\n\nMostly, though, *wailing* I WANT ROGUE BACK AS ROGUE!\n\nSorry.  At least she would get the chance to feel love through a touch a little before her powers came back, though."

The Jazzmasters do not go on tour anymore - havent recorded an album since the 90's\nPaul Hardcastle released some albums as the Jazzmasters in the '90s in addition to his normal output. The Jazzmasters moniker is somewhat misleading — the Jazzmasters are essentially a Hardcastle solo project featuring vocalist Helen Rogers as well as the occasional contributor like reedist Phil Todd. The first Jazzmasters album appeared in 1991, with subsequent albums coming every few years. The Jazzmasters albums explore more electronic sounds than Hardcastle's traditional output; it's not strictly dance music, but is quite lively and seemingly trendy for contemporary jazz music. The albums sold very well; however, critics were less than impressed.
i can't think of any that appeared in more than one but i can think of a few that have been in at least one;\njason biggs -the american pie trilogy\nantonio banderas -spy kids trilogy\nal pacino -the godfather trilogy\nice cube -the friday trilogy\narnold schwarzenegger -terminator trilogy\njason james richter -free willy trilogy\nsylvester stallone -rambo trilogy\nbruce willis -die hard trilogy\nwesley snipes -blade trilogy\nvin diesel - pitch black trilogy (yes the second one was dark fury they used his likeness and voice...\ni know this is not exactly what you asked for but i hope it helps...by the way the matrix is not a trilogy...did everyone forget about the animatrix

What's wrong with fiction? If Dan Brown was trying to pass this off as nonfiction, there would be a huge outcry, and rightly so. But I'm an ordained evangelical minister who has absolutely no problem with DVC because it's fiction and Dan Brown has never stated otherwise. If Christians would just go back to the Bible to find out the truth, then the so-called confusion being caused by DVC would be nonexistent. Problem solved.
"what movie are you referring to?  In some cases, I think this is true...but not the majority of cases. \n\nSome movies have a great compilation of popular songs that really tie a story together...esp. 80s movies or movies like ""Grosse Point Blank"" about a high school reunion that is filled with songs from the character's high school period.\n\nAlso, Musicals often have a weaker plot and are tied together by songs, so in those cases, I think the music determines the success of the storyline.\n\nOther movies have a very strong score that is unforgettable...ie. Superman, Star Wars, etc.  I think in those cases the score really boosts the already strong storyline."

"Wow. You would think a ""cheeky"" question would generate more answers.  I grew up in the USA, so I'm not even positive what ""cheeky"" is.  \n\nSelf confidence is a different matter.  I suppose any number of self-help books and techniques could help you there.\n\nBut I think first of all, you need to be yourself. That way you will attract friends who like you.  If you act cheeky and self confident, and feel otherwise, you will attract people you would rather not spend time with.\n\nHowever, that wasn't your question.  \n\nOkay, I just looked up cheeky: Impertinently bold; impudent and saucy. I would say read cheeky material, hang out with cheeky friends, and it's bound to rub off.  \n\nAs for self confident: showing poise and confidence in your own worth...it doesn't seem to be a synonym for cheeky. \n\nCheeky seems to hinge on a disregard for accepted measurements of society. Self confidence seems to require an understanding of accepted forms of evaluating an individual.\n\nPerhaps you could be a poised, polite, person...who is bold (cheeky) about facing life's hardships, but humble and self confident, when dealing with relationships.\n\n...you know, someone who faces life sarcastically, but treats people with serious consideration...\n\nNow that sounds like someone I could be friends with."

Depends on which version you watch.  I love that movie!  :)
"My favorite X-Men comic character is Iceman.  I suppose because he reminds me a lot of my favorite Marvel character of all time, Spider-Man.  Both characters have their serious side, but are still witty, even in a fight.  As you can imagine, I enjoyed watching ""Spider-Man & His Amazing Friends"" as a kid.  I really don't think Iceman, or most of the original X-Men lineup for that matter, have ever been given fair treatment in the movies.\n\nAs far as characters I'd like to have seen in the films, I will use the last member of the ""Amazing Friends"" I've yet to mention, Firestar.  Granted, she didn't appear in a comic book until well after her TV debut, but I would still like to see this ""hottie"" included in an X-Men movie.  Since Pyro is in the movies, having the two of them face off would be interesting, to say the least.  If Firestar created flames, one would have to wonder if Pyro could take control of them & turn them against her allies."

Lohan. She is real, not some stupid little twit who sings about rain, and yesterday. I cant stand little miss duff. I hope linsdey kicks her.
trance normally runs anywhere from 135bpm, up to around 155ish, but ideally, good trance normally runs in the 140bpm mark.\n\n8beat sections. 4 by 4. \ntrance normally has a 'mellow' section, where the overall tune is dropped to a mellow sound, either vocal or instrumental.(vocal normallly works best in my opinion. female vocals seem to work better than male, its softer)\ndownload and listen to a few trance songs, and you will pic k up patterns, commong things between them. \nbut the biggest thing is difference. notice, every trance song, has a different style to it. be unique, add your own touch. there is no 'rule book' so to speak. trance is one of the longest running genres, because, its so varied and can adapt easily to latest styles. many styles of trance. hard trance, progressive trance, euro trance....\n\ni never really got into the composing side of things. i played with it, using cubase but, primarily, just DJ'd, so i couldnt tell you the techniques, just what it sounds like

Xena would win, but only after seducing WW with her hot lesbian charm. WW and Xena would go to bed and as they are starting to make love, Xena pulls a sword from under her pillow and behead WW.Although that would be stupid, because Xena would have lost her chance to be with one of the hottest women in the world...LOL!!!
Not enough information for an accurate chart I'm afraid.\nThe best web site for this sort of thing is at the bottom of this answer.\n\nYou'll need birth date, time and location for an accurate chart, however you can get an approximation without the birth time if it's the best you've got.\n\nI was sceptical when I first came across this site. I have since been impressed time and time again. Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously. Remember it's all someone elses interpretation, so it can't be entirely true...\n\n...but it's close!\n\nBest way to find out is spend some time together first and then, if you feel it's going well and would like to understand the relationship deeper, suggest looking at the site together. His response will tell you what you need to know. ;)
Anything less than 8 hours will be great.

I live a few hours from AC and have a friend who lives right on the Shore and works in AC.\nThis is one of my favorite bars: http://www.cityatlantic.com/dining/anchorage-tavern.html and the Residence Inn is my favorite place to stay: http://travel.yahoo.com/p-hotel-372063-residence_inn_by_marriott-i  now these are both in Somer's Point which is right near AC, so it's a little nicer.\nBut if you're planning on not being able to drive and want to stay right off the boardwalk I would suggest this http://reservations.hotel-guides.us/hotel/10006044-11285666O.html Holiday Inn.  It's clean and nicer than a lot of Holiday Inn's (I won't normally stay in them - but this one is good).  Definitely go to the tropicana and the shops on the boardwalk etc.  Have fun!

"Ok, well Mr, Eko and Locke just found the question mark that Eko had in his dream. Since Annalucia was shot, she wants them to come together and find another hatch. Then they did and found another video. It says that this was some kind of team experiment. Michael shot Anna because he needed to free Henry for the others. He also shot Libby who later died. No body actually knows where Walt is. Michael blamed the shooting on Henry and even shot himself for ""proof"". I hope I helped!\n\nI think in the end this will be sort of like a dream or like prediction to someone. They might be getting on a plane and bam...there's the season all over again..."

I have  been playing Bass for over 20 yrs. played out in the  local circuit. I have to  say, there has to  be a top 10 or 5 at  least. Stu Hamm(satriani), Geddy Lee(Rush),Les Claypool(primus), James Myung(Dream Theater), Flea (red hot chili peppers.........see? the list can get endless.\n\nMy current fav for me is, James Myung of Dream Theater.......dude plays a 6 string bass so effortlessly that I  get jealous I'm not the player  HE  is. If you've not heard D T..check em' out. ya won't be sorry. ROCK ON!

Paul Edgecomb in Green Mile and of course, Forrest Gump; I also liked the character who gets stuck in the airport who's from another country.  (I can't remember the name of the movie OR his character in it this afternoon.. another brain cell bites the dust!) I guess my favorite, though,  would be his role in Apollo 13. That gave me cold chills!
You can download movies, games, applications.. other stuffs using bit torrents... there are many sites that you can visit to find torrents... www.mininova.org, www.torrentspy.com, www.torrentportal.com etc... to download a bit torrent software go to www.bittorrent.com\n\nWARNING: It is illigal to download copywrited material.
limewire is an illegal file sharing program, so be aware that you may be breaking the law by downloading music from there.\n\nthere arent really many places to find instrumental tracks legally on the net, but im sure if you search with a lot of search engines, you can find them on some website.
No both the movies are different although based on cricket follow a different story.\nI did nt like the songs of Iqbal. You can check online who is the music director of the movie.

Fullmetal Alchemist for Drama, Inuyasha for suspense and bloodshed, and Beyblade for Saturday morning boredom. I haven't seen a new ep of Fullmetal or Inuyasha in the longest time. But I've read the episode summaries of Fullmetal and know how it ends. What about Inuyasha. The movies have been great!!!\nYes, I deffinately like Fullmetal Alchemist the most. It's really a great plotline, but Yu Yu Hakusho and Rurouni Kenshin will take pride any day!!! ^_~V haha!

"I like this poem very much. It says exactly what a soldier must be feeling. I especially like the part that says ""My hearts pounding wildly as I fight to stay free. Sweat, grime, and sand are stuck to my skin. My clothes hang on loosely cause I've gotten so thin. I'm a father, a husband, a brother, or son."" I think that sometimes people forget that our soldiers are somembody's father, brother, or son instead of just an American soldier. This is well-written. Have you thought of setting it to music or putting it in a book with other poems like this that you write? I believe that it would sell. I certainly would read a book like that."

"Spike - The ultimate bad boy. The conflict of the character over the feelings he had for Buffy was terrific. How many of us have struggled with liking someone that we know we shouldn't.\n\nXander - The boy next door. Most of the time he was a nervous wimp but let any of his ""family"" be threatened and he was the first one on the way to help. Plus, the boy's love life sucked..first Willow, then Buffy and when he finally finds Anya; she gets killed....I really felt for him.\n\nGiles - The father figure. No matter how he tried to hold himself aside from the group emotionally, he could never keep his feelings at bay. No matter how digusted or disappointed he was with one of them, he still had their backs in a crisis.  The true father feelings that he developed for Buffy were wonderful."
being an american soldier, probably get killed... errrrr or kill alot of somalians...\n\nor maybe even steal a whole bunch of weapons from someone and sell them for money, and become a respected arms dealer, and then work my way up to becoming the drug/gun lord...\n\nbut probably get killed.

Yay you! Overall, before the media mauled the entire story, I heard from Courtney Cox's friend that it was mutual....or so they say. Anyway, it's not my life and I have no right to dig around their life. I'd hate it if someone did that to me.
No in no way Debojeet deserved this win.His opponent Vineet was the best in every song which he sang and have u seen his song of his first album which was just released,i thnk i hvnt seen such an idiotic soong ever b4.

I'm only answering your first question. No it's not ok to fist fight a woman if you are a man. If you're a woman then yeah it's ok. As far as that other stuff you wrote, you have too much time on your hands and really need to get a better hobby.
Yes She did her name was Keshai Cooper She was in her 20's
NO WAY! She's an insult to women, a terrible role model for girls, and the perfect example of conspicuous consumption. Instead of partying and blowing money she should think about spending most of that cash on something that's meaningful.She probably has no trouble sleeping at night because she's a spoiled brat without a conscience, but I wouldn't be able to stand myself.
Technically, Chelsea isn't a Brady. Beau's biological father is Victor Kyriacos. Since Sean Brady (Caroline's husband) raised him and he thought for years that Sean was his dad he simply continue to use Brady as his last name.\n\nAccording to a character bio.. it said that Max and Frankie came to Salem in 1987 to escape an abusive father. Both were adopted by Caroline and Sean Brady.
Neither - they were both so annoying!

A cocktail is a style of mixed drink. A cocktail usually contains one or more types of liquor and flavourings, usually one or more of a liqueur, fruit, sauce, honey, milk or cream, spices, etc. The cocktail became popular during Prohibition in the United States primarily to mask the taste of bootlegged alcohol, the bartenders at a speakeasy would mix it with other ingredients, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.

"Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: И́горь Фёдорович Страви́нский Igor' Fëdorovič Stravinskij) (June 17, 1882 – April 6, 1971) was a Russian-born composer of modern classical music. He composed in the primitivist, neo-classical and serialist styles, but he is best known for three works from his earlier, Russian period: Le sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring), Petrushka and L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). For some, these daring and innovative ballets practically reinvented the genre. Stravinsky also wrote in a broad spectrum of ensemble combinations and classical forms. His oeuvre included everything from symphonies to piano miniatures.\n\nStravinsky also achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his own works. He was also a writer. With the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, Stravinsky composed a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music. In it, he famously claimed that music was incapable of ""expressing anything but itself"". Robert Craft transcribed several interviews with the composer, which were published as Conversations with Stravinsky.\n\nA quintessentially cosmopolitan Russian, Stravinsky was one of the most influential composers and artists of 20th century music, both in the West and in his native land. He was named by Time magazine as one of the most influential people of the century.\n\nStravinsky was born in Oranienbaum (now Lomonosov), near St. Petersburg, Russia. Brought up in St. Petersburg and dominated by his father and elder brother, Stravinsky's early childhood was a mix of experience that hinted little at the cosmopolitan artist he was to become. Although his father Fyodor Stravinsky was a bass singer at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, Stravinsky originally studied to be a lawyer. He switched to composition later. In 1902, at the age of 20, Stravinsky became the pupil of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, probably the leading Russian composer of the time.\n\nStravinsky left Russia for the first time in 1910, going to Paris to attend the premiere of his ballet L'Oiseau de feu (The Firebird). During his stay in the city, he composed two further works for the Ballets Russes—Petrushka (1911) and Le Sacre du printemps (The Rite of Spring) (1913). The ballets trace his stylistic development: from the L'oiseau de feu, whose style draws largely on Rimsky-Korsakov, to Petrushka's emphasis on bitonality, and finally to the savage polyphonic dissonance of Le Sacre du printemps. As Stravinsky noted about the premieres, his intention was ""[to send] them all to hell"". (He succeeded: the 1913 première of Le sacre du printemps was probably the most famous riot in music history).\n\nStravinsky displayed an inexhaustible desire to learn and explore art, literature, and life. This desire manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations. Not only was he the principal composer for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, but he also collaborated with Pablo Picasso (Pulcinella, 1920), Jean Cocteau (Oedipus Rex, 1927) and George Balanchine (Apollon Musagete, 1928).\n\nRelatively short of stature and not conventionally handsome, Stravinsky was nevertheless photogenic, as many pictures show. He was still young when, on 23 January 1906, he married his cousin Katerina Nossenko whom he had known since early childhood. Their marriage endured for 33 years, but the true love of his life, and later his partner until his death, was his second wife Vera de Bosset (1888-1982). Although a notorious philanderer (even rumoured to have affairs with high-class partners such as Coco Chanel), Stravinsky was also a family man who devoted considerable amounts of his time and expenditure to his sons and daughters. One of his sons, Soulima Stravinsky, was also a composer, but is little known compared to his father.\n\nWhen Stravinsky met Vera in the early 1920s, she was married to the painter and stage designer Serge Sudeikin, but they soon began"

""Say, Lizard Pecker, WHAT did you say you gave your mule when he was sick with colic?"" Jon asked. \n\n""I said I gave him turpentine."" \n\n""Well, I gave turpentine to MINE and it died!"" \n\nAmanpreet nods his head. ""That's strange.

When they neared the pew where he sat, the youngster piped up so that everyone could hear: ""Don't pay for me Daddy, I'm under five."" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA little boy was attending his first wedding. After the service, his cousin asked him, ""How many women can a man marry?"" \n\n""Sixteen,"" the boy responded. \n\nHis cousin was amazed that he had an answer so quickly. ""How do you know that?"" ""Easy,"" the little boy said. ""All you have to do is add it up, like the Bishop said: 4 better, 4 worse, 4 richer, 4 poorer."" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter a church service on Sunday morning, a young boy suddenly announced to his mother, ""Mom, I've decided to become a minister when I grow up."" \n\n""That's okay with us, but what made you decide that?"" \n\n""Well,"" said the little boy, ""I have to go to church on Sunday anyway, and I figure it will be more fun to stand up and yell, than to sit and listen."" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA 6-year-old was overheard reciting the Lord's Prayer at a church service: ""And forgive us our trash passes, as we forgive those who passed trash against us."" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA boy was watching his father, a pastor, write a sermon. ""How do you know what to say?"" he asked. \n\n""Why, God tells me."" \n\n""Oh, then why do you keep crossing things out?"" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA little girl became restless as the preacher's sermon dragged on and on. \n\nFinally, she leaned over to her mother and whispered, ""Mommy, if we give him the money now, will he let us go?"" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter the christening of his baby brother in church, Little Johnny sobbed all the way home in the back seat of the car. His father asked him three times what was wrong. \n\nFinally, the boy replied, ""That priest said he wanted us brought up in a Christian home, and I want to stay with you guys!"" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTerri asked her Sunday School class to draw pictures of their favorite Bible stories. She was puzzled by Kyle's picture, which showed four people on an airplane, so she asked him which story it was meant to represent. \n\n""The flight to Egypt,"" said Kyle. \n\n""I see ... And that must be Mary, Joseph, and Baby Jesus,"" Ms. Terri said. ""But who's the fourth person?"" \n\n""Oh, that's Pontius -the Pilot."" \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Sunday School Teacher asks, ""Now, Johnny, tell me frankly do you say prayers before eating?"" \n\n""No sir,"" little Johnny replies, ""I don't have to.

the song is very Moby ish in sound. some of his ambient works with piano sound very much like the one in the commercial. however it isn't the same and i know i do not have it any where in my vast collection of moby Cd's. i think that it may be by some other author. but since i know that moby has done a bunch of works for TV and movies that are not on any of his albums it may actually be an original of his for the commercial.

Yeah, I remember seeing that at the time, it was pretty amusing. I think someone worked out recently that the scene where Trinity (or whatever her name was) goes into slow-mo in the air and kicks two men is actually the most spoofed scene of any movie ever.

I personally think when a couple shows so much affection in front of the public eye, it most likely won't last. Is like they were showing off to the world. I think it was lust and if she stays married to him is because he has her whipped. He's a maniac. I use to think he was cute, now he just freaks me out.

The Meisenberg Universitat ran a 15 year program on 7500 pregnant women and their babies between 1957 and 1972 (using findings reported by Dr. Joseph Mengela from his experiments at the Oswieczim Klinische in 1944-45).  The chief physicians involved were Drs. Heinrich Schimmelmann (a clinical obstetrician), Gertruda Greundfeld (a clinical psychologist) and Magda Zhitanska (a clinical pediatrician and para psychologist).  The team was headed by Dr. Mikhail Ivanovich Strovankiev (psychiatrist and mathematician) until he retired in 1964 and was replaced by Dr. Gunther Romanovich (psychiatric pediatrician).\n\nThey concluded  from their experiments that the children exposed to Bach and Mozart for at least 5 continuous hours twice weekly during the third trimester of pregnancy and the first 2 years of life were about 25% faster in learning mathematics at the ages of 7 - 14.  Because the study ended, there was apparently no follow-up to determine whether or not the trend continued at later ages.   \n \nThose children likewise exposed to Italian opera were on par with the children not exposed to music at all, while the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian folk music were about 10% ahead on the learning curve.  Rock and Roll resulted in about a 5% decline in math skills, but a 15% increase in language abilities, both in German and foreign languages.\n\nSchimmelmann, Greunfeld and Zhitansku postulated that the increased mathematical skills derives from the meticulous mathematical construct of Bach and Mozart,  while the more whimsical lyrical quality of the Italian operas did not engender the mathematical focus of the German selections.  (This may be a conclusion based  more on  propaganda than actual scientific results.)  They also attributed the increased math learning by the children exposed to Blues, Jazz and Bavarian Folk music on the less intricate but inherent mathematical foundation of these forms of music, while concluding that the less mathematical but more free-flowing and innovative rhythms in Rock enhanced the artistic and  imaginative characteristics of subjects, making them receptive to understanding language better, but less able to work problems in math and logic.\n\nThe experiment was a joint effort sponsored by the East German and Soviet governments, in conjunction with related research into para psychological phenomena.  The para psychological components of the study have been largely ignored, but the study did report increased psychic abilities in the children exposed to Rock, which follows from the conclusions reached as mentioned above.\n\nThe study was reported in the July 19, 1976, edition of Pravda and mentioned in the January 24, 1977, edition of Die Zeitung.  It was  largely discounted by the Western scientific community at the time.  To my knowledge, the actual study has never been published in the West and Western criticism was without benefit of reviewing the research.\n\nI became aware of the study while enrolled at Julliard in 1978, but was unable to procure a copy of the study beyond that reported in Pravda and Die Zeitung.  I was so intrigued by the articles that I have retained my notes on them, but unfortunately cannot locate the actual articles.  Sorry. \n\nIf you find anything further on the study, particularly about any follow-up study which may have been done, please post it here.  I had forgotten about the whole affair until reading your question.

I actually asked this question on here as well, since I really wanted to know.  I think we're curious because Paris and Nicole were best friends, and now they seem to hate each other.  It makes us wonder what happened so terrible to split up their friendship.  One of the answers I got was that Nicole was jealous that Paris was asked to be on Saturday Night Live and she wasn't, so she had a party that night and showed Paris's sex video.  I heard that from one of those magazines as well.  If that's true, that certainly would have ended a lifelong friendship.  Maybe we'll never know for sure, but I wish one of them would spill the beans.

good question....Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you and trusting them not to.. but still some people does..i loved a girl sincerely ofcourse she too,we came to know each other through mobile chatting,we loved without seeing eachother,we met last year in kolkatta,actually i am a south indian,for one month, after our meeting she was normal with me..donno what happened!! she started to maintain distance with me,by saying her family problems she asked to stop everything..but i could not do it..she wants me only as her friend..i donno what to do....!!i am still confused..this is my love story..actually love is..TO THE WORLD YOU MAY BE JUST ONE PERSON,BUT TO ONE PERSON YOU MAY BE THE WORLD,so..love the one who loves you..nawyia you just remember this..the person who loves you will hurt you much,but he/she is the only one who will cry for you whenever you are in trouble..be sincere in love..
Not at all.  She's a bad mother so far.  She has a lot of learning to do.  I mean come on!  That's is what being a mother is all about.  Learning what to do BEFORE you have the child.  I could have had a child at 13 and still been a better mother than her. And about her being pregnant....what in the hell does she see in KF?  I mean come on!  He's the opitomy of a hick and they're babies are little hicks in the making.  I actually think all this was done as a publicity stunt.  Why does she not take birth control?  Oh wait, I forgot.  Hicks don't use birth control.

I have purposely avoided seeing the film because it insults me.  I recognize the propaganda and agenda.  Maybe this answers your question.
Gemini is an air sign and thus a perfect match for Gemini would be considered other air signs. However Fire signs also match up well with Gemini and despite what you may have heard, Sagittarius (which is Gemini's Polar Opposite) is a GREAT match if you can learn to make your differences work for you. However be careful with aries and leo who are too arrogant for the tastes of geminis (and most other people too, lol). \nLibra and aquarius are air signs and thus considered perfect matches for gemini. Libras are the only ones who are capable of bending enough for stubborn geminis. Aquarians tend to be a little too suspicious for anything to really come about with gemini. \n\nAll of this is generally speaking of course. There are plenty of websites and books you can consult but keep in mind that everything you read will be generally speaking. Astrology tells you a lot about basic personality but it is highly complex science.

His voice is dark and seductively mysterious reaching all the secret dark corners inside me.\nI ran across his music by accident and haven stopped listening to him since.  \nI love the video that Ville Valo, H.I.M vocals, did with Lauri Ylönen, from The Rasmus, ""Bittersweet"" (Apocalyptica single)...Ugh, gut wrenching ballad...He's one of my lesser known favorites and by that I mean that he is not as popular as he should be."
Gary Sinise... but I'd have to say in his earlier years, Ed Harris could certainly hold his own. Only lately has he gotten a more aged look - which is only natural. But yeah, my vote is for Gary, he definately ages gracefully!
Douglock is a seperate entity than Cypher.  Cypher never was Douglock.  It turns out that Warlock had amnesia and then after wanted to honor the memory of his dead friend.

"In tonight's episode, the season finale, we open with Jim Brass being shot in slow-motion. The CSIs and paramedics rush to his aid and take him to the hospital. Once he's inside the room for surgery, he crashes. The doctors are able to restart his heart with the defibrillator.\n\nWe cut to a scene which presumably took place some time ago, with Jim Brass speaking to Grissom. Brass tells Grissom that he's the only person he trusts with his life and would like him to have power attorney over him.\n\nWe then move back to the hospital, where a surgeon briefs Grissom about Brass' condition. He was shot twice. One bullet was lodged in his vest and the other is lodged near his heart. Grissom then receives a call about a case. There's a dead body near the railroad tracks in Henderson. Because of this, Grissom has to leave the hospital and get to work.\n\nAs Grissom arrives to the scene at the railroad tracks, he and Sofia talk about Brass. She just talked to Undersheriff McKeen and has learned he's in pretty bad shape. They then walk further down the tracks and come upon a dead body lying in between the tracks. A train ran the person over about an hour ago and the engineer couldn't stop in time. One noticeable injury is the body was decapitated. Nick thinks it's likely from the train, but the head is nowhere to be found. Nick notices that there's virtually no blood on the ground, which is odd if this is where the decapitation took place. Grissom agrees but he thinks the body was likely dragged quite a ways, until the train came to a stop. Without the head, Grissom sends Nick to go look for it. Grissom and Nick split up to look for it, and Grissom finds a toupé. David Berman enters the scene to examine the body and is shocked to see that the person's waist is so narrow. It seems to have been compressed.\n\nAfter the credits roll, we rejoin David Berman trying to obtain a liver temperature, which can give them an idea of when the person died. Unfortunately, the liver isn't in the normal place, which is causing David to poke multiple holes into the body, to which Grissom asks, ""are you getting the liver temp or performing acupuncture?"" He's eventually able to find the liver, but the body doesn't look any better with all of the holes in it. Sara wonders if the man committed suicide... maybe lost a ton of cash at the tables and wanted to end it all.\n\nAt a hotel in the city, Catherine walks down a hallway, being briefed by the super. He found a deceased man, Manny Rupert, in his hotel room. Manny had been playing music pretty late that night, so the super knocked on the door to ask him to turn it down, but found Manny was dead, so he called in the police. The super is very talkative and seems interested in some sort of reward, so when Catherine gets to Manny's room, she tells the super to ""stay here and shut up."" Catherine then enters the hotel room and finds a lot of booze and cake on the table. Warrick and Dr. Robbins join her and are surprised by all of the booze in the room. The man clearly partied well into the night. Dr. Robbins believes Manny died only three or four hours ago, based on the amount of body rigor. Warrick picks up the wallet and notices there's no cash left. As Catherine makes her way around the room, she finds broken glass on the floor near the bed. A few pieces of glass appear to have blood on it, likely because someone without shoes stepped on it, cutting his/her feet. On the nightstand, Warrick finds a lot of pills, and inside, a pistol. Catherine checks the wall across from the bed and finds a few bullet holes. Someone shot out the mirror, which explains the broken glass.\n\nBack to the railroad crime scene, we catch up with Nick, who walks across a bridge and finds a large barrel which was used to burn something. It's parked in the middle of a small stream. Inside the barrel, Nick picks something out with a stick, but it's u"

Scorpio and Aquarius\nOn their first meeting Aquarians see Scorpios as deep and mysterious, someone very compelling to know. Scorpios see Aquarians as an unusual and intellectual challenge, someone it may take a long time to know completely. There may be an immediate sexual attraction between them as, like everyone, Aquarians find Scorpios magnetic, enigmatic and very attractive. Scorpios are always interested in potential sexual partners and they will find the Aquarian's cool emotional side so fascinating they will be sure there is a real passion hiding underneath.\n\nAquarians find Scorpios are a difficult but compulsive subject to analyse with their secretive nature and deep emotions. Scorpios will find Aquarians equally interesting but for a different reason. Aquarians want to be intellectual friends but Scorpios want to be passionate lovers and if the Aquarian does succumb to the Scorpio's charms they may find themselves almost consumed in passion. Although Aquarians like to experience everything possible in life they will not want a repeat performance. Once the Scorpio has figured out that the Aquarian really is as cool emotionally as they appear they will lose interest. This can cause obvious problems.\n\nAquarians want to be friends with everyone and Scorpios want to possess. This combination will always be difficult but if both have planets like Venus (love), Mars (desires), the Moon (emotions) and Mercury (mentality) in other more compatible signs it can be a successful match. If not it may be that opposites attract initially but they find it difficult to find anything in common to keep them together. This relationship will be hard work but if the Aquarian can learn to express their feelings without being fearful of losing their individuality and the Scorpio can learn to use their mental abilities and share their lives with a very interesting partner it may work.\n\n\nhope this will be helpfully for you ! :)

I'm trying to understand what this question has to do with Celebrities? You are not proving yourself very smart when you give no thought to where you post your question.\n\nAs for why guys don't understand girls, can you make the claim you understand guys any better?\n\nBeing confident in one's self is something, man or woman, should have in themselves. Being over confident isn't something males own, I know lots of girls who think they are hot and every guy wants to date them. They get offended if a guy that catches their eye doesn't fall down and kiss their feet. And then try to accuse the guy of being gay if he tells them they are nothing special.
".... i so better get 10 points for this....... OK here goes,,,, \n\ni was 17 and my mom went to Reno. My Ex  came over ""he is older than me"" and bought beer. well i decided to actually try beer for the first time. I felt nutten and kept  drinking. after the 3rd one i got tipsy. i was like ""this is fun"" and drank 2 more. I got so drunk i went out front and sat on a milk crate singing strange country songs out loud ""like different lyrics to different songs"" then  i noticed a cereal box on the curb and my cat walked by me so i picked him up.. walked to the cereal box ""with the milk crate as well"" and put my cat under the milk crate ""like a cage"" and picked up the cereal box and told everyone ""look what i got!!! a magic cereal box!! i traded my cat to the leprechaun for a magic cereal box!"" \n\n\n........... to this day i am teased for it ... hope it at least got a chuckle outta you because dang i be embarrassed lol"

In the United States, based on album sales:\n\n1. The Beatles\n2. Elvis Presley\n3. Garth Brooks\n4. Led Zeppelin\n5. The Eagles\n6. Billy Joel\n7. Pink Floyd \n8. Barbra Streisand\n9. Elton John\n10. AC/DC\n\nThere really is no reliable worldwide list because many countries do not keep good track of album sales, but I imagine it would be similar to this.

He died because a hater was jealous. Thats why. He was driving around in las vegas and got shot. Its a shame to if you ask me that someone let jealously got to someone so much that they had to end someone elses life. Tupac was the best rapper and he would still be if he was alive.\n\nR.I.P Tupac\n*gone but not forgotten*\n\nIts funny too because the person who killed him did it so pac wouldnt be succesful. Pac is dead now, but still, his music is selling millions. Funny how karma works huh?

There is no visual difference. Sound quality, unless of course you're tone deaf. If you've bought a new piano they will tune it for you when delivered but must be re-tuned again after it settles, usually within a year. If you play alot afterwards you'll need tuning more often.\n\nIn this case it's sound, not sight.

"Hi! The question should be, ""why do we fall in love and become fools?"" Actually, in my own opinion, it is not just fools who falls in love but everyone falls in love as well.. even the brightest man/woman became fools when love hit them. We don't and can't control it. It just happen. Sometimes, we do stupid things when we're in love. We follow our hearts than following our minds that is why we are like fools in the end."

I don't know your tastes, but I listen to LaunchCast to determine which music I should download. I don't get any of the music I like on public radio around here, so that's what I'm reduced to. I also check billboard top 100 to see if anything seems like something I'd like.
just about all of them.

Well if your story has any truth to it, obviously, it wouldn't be that hard to figure you out! You're the intern at the record label.\n\nAnyway, don't tell, just yet! Let the story escalate within the industry, let the price go up, and then sell!!! It's all about taking care of number one, and if someone is willing to pay you for it- go for it! Don't feel bad about kissing and telling, feel sorry for the fools who pay you to tell it, and more so, buy it, read it, and believe it!!\n\nAnd just think about the scandal, and the lawsuit, if you should loose your job over it! Why should you loose your position, (because your a woman, I presume), is the label dropping him because he willingly engaged in such situation, as well? By the time you're done with him and the record label, you won't need to worry about a career!

Then, I'd start the wheel spinning--going faster and faster, until she spun so fast, she passed out. Then I'd pick her off and toss her out of the tank, LOL!! Thanx for the Laugh, gerbil!!

"A crusty old Marine Sergeant Major found himself at a gala event hosted by a local liberal arts college. There was no shortage of extremely young, idealistic ladies in attendance, one of whom approached the  Sergeant Major for conversation.\n\n ""Excuse me, Sergeant Major, but you seem to be a very serious man. Is something bothering you?"" Negative, ma'am. Just serious by nature.""\n""The young lady looked at his awards and decorations and said, ""It looks like you have seen a lot of  action."" ""Yes, ma'am, a lot of action.""\nThe young lady, tiring of trying to start up a conversation, said, ""You know, you should lighten up a little. Relax and enjoy yourself.""\n\n The Sergeant Major just stared at her in his serious  manner.\n\n Finally the young lady said, ""You know, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but when is the last  time you had sex?"" \n""1955, ma'am.""\n\n ""Well, there you are. You really need to chill out and  quit taking everything so seriously! I mean, no sex since 1955! She took his hand and led him to a private  room where she proceeded to ""relax"" him several times.\n\nAfterwards, panting for breath, she leaned against his bare chest and said, ""Wow, you sure didn't forget much since 1955!""\n\nThe Sergeant Major, glancing at his watch, said in his matter-of-fact voice, ""I hope not, it's only 2130 now.""\n\n (Don't ya love military time?!)"

Micheal J Fox is a sweetheart. All around decent human being. My heart goes out to him because of his disease but he is putting that aside and trying to help other people with the same affliction. He is also Canadian.
The song was written and originally released in 1959 by Hank Ballard and the Midnighters as a B-side
You can find out for yourself if they ask you for money in order to represent your daughter. No legit agency would do that. Legit agencies would only take a percentage of your daughter's pay *after* they have gotten her work. They also shouldn't be trusted if they insist that you pay for new headshots by their photographer or any other service. They can recommend that you do those things, but if their representation of your daughter is contingent on you paying them money *before* your daughter gets any work, I wouldn't trust them.\n\nAlso find out what their union affiliations are (SAG, AFTRA, Actor's Equity, etc.) and see if you can find out information about them from those unions. Good luck! If they are legit, it really is a great thing!

Well because a building is never completely built. You are always having to rebuild something when it wears out breaks rots or just doesn't work with your kind of lifestyle.\nIn other words a building is always in the act of changing into something else to be built. It is never finished, if it is to stand for years and centuries it has to always be in a state of repair and that is building it over and over and over.

nah....elizabethtown is pretty good.  its from the same guy who did almost famous, cameron crowe, and i would say its typical of his movies.  they're all a little longer than they 'could' be, but you can't think of exactly what you'd cut out because its all good.  i enjoyed it, and i think thats saying something because i kind of think orlando bloom is kind of a douche.  he fits the pirates and LOTR and THATS ABOUT IT because hes not the best actor.  and in response to the other person....garden state was WONDERFUL and should NOT be compared to this movie.  same genre....completely different.  thats like saying gone in 60 seconds and armageddon are the same movie because they contain a lot of action where one family member is sticking up for another.  you shouldn't overgeneralize

Back when my dad went to school kids were told they were dumb. You were smart or you were dumb. The mother would say ""what is wrong with my child"" and the teacher would say ""your child is dumb"". Today it has to be A.D.D. or H.A.A.D.. People say ""my child has A.D.D."" no lady your child is D.U.M.B.\n\nof course it is all in the delivery. \n\nthen there is the old seenus trouble\n\nI ran into a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. I ask how he was doing and he said he was fine. I ask where he had been all this time and he said ""Man I was in the hospital"".\n\nI said hospital, Why??\n\nHe said ""man I had seenus trouble""\n\nI said man you mean sinus trouble.\nHe said ""no I mean seenus trouble, I was coming out of a hotel with a woman and her husband seen us""\n\nI am not a comedian I am a singer but that one usually works when I tell it between songs."

Bea Arthur is a practical lady.  She doesn't go for high-priced toiletry items.  If she had to decide between two shampoos, and one was $5 and the other was $10, she would go for the $5 shampoo.  Her home is practical, too.  It is nicely decorated, but certainly not lavish.  She's rich but not a snob.
I found Cheese to be amusing.
yes i think she is why did she get a nose job? because she is not great looking and wants to be hot like her sister jessica and ashlee cant sing what she was caught lip synching on tv boooo her

Mary and Matt come home and announced they are each expecting twins.  Then Lucy announces she's expecting twins. Two sets of boys and one set of girls.  Plus Simon and Rose do not get married.
I know for sure  that anise seed or anise oil, even the anise candy or tea is very good to clarify the vocal chords, another thing I have read is slippery elm bark, I guess you get it in pill form at a nutritional store.

The chances of you being able to buy a copy directly from a retailer are VERY slim, at best, so getting a copy from a ""fan"" or other interested party might work better.

They should've put it in Taylor's yard and then called the Police to report him and he would've gone to jail and never been seen again!
I would agree that Tool have a good record of mixing heavy and progressive rock. Certainly, their album 10,000 Days has performed well debuting at #1 in the US, Australia, Europe, New Zealand and Canada. It has also received a  generally positive critical response as shown by the links below
Phantom of the opera. It's about a man who was born with a deformity and lives under an opera house. He teaches a girl, Christine, to sing beautifully, and falls in love with her. Then Christine kind of falls in love with a childhood sweetheart, but the phantom (that's the man under ground) keeps trying to get Christine to himself. In the end, he lets Christine go with Raoul (the childhood sweetheart) out of love. Christine should definitiley ave gone with the phantom. He was so passionate, and he was never loved by anybody. It's my all time favorite because it's so sad, and because it's such a fantastic story, and the music is great. Good enough? Hope it wasn't too long for you!
First 8-track: I think it was by Steppenwolf. I don't remember how old I was.\n\nFirst record: `Chipmunk Rock' by Alvin and the Chipmunks.

Talk about stupid questions...\n\nanyway, no, Dumblebore is dead and he will stay that way. Harry can communicate with him though, using the portrait that appeared after his death.\n\nIt's more likely that Snape is indeed loyal to the order of the Phoenix and that him killing Dumbledore was something that he and Dumbledore set up together (remember their fight in book 6, the one that Harry overheard?) knowing full well that this would ensure that \na) Voldermort would finally take a chance to actually kill Harry, something he wouldn't do as long as Dumbledore was still alive\nand\nb) Voldemort really believes that Snape is a loyal deatheater, thus making sure that Voldemort doesn't expect Snape to kil him. Which will of course happen, probably helped by Harry. And probably Snape is going to die in this attempt.

"Get used to it.  Mass pop culture will NEVER catch up to all the sub-varieties of anything.  It can't.  The vast majority is NOT interested in the HUGE fine-tuning of what's what if it's not their thing.\nBe an ambassador.  Politely agree that, ""Yes, it's comics"", & that it's a Japanese form.  Then you can go into a two or ten minute dialogue on the subject, depending on the interest which they show.  Most non-fans have at least heard of ""Pokeman"", ""Dragonball Z"" and a few others.  Mention these & gradually segue into what you have & why you like it.  Then you can add on what you like which you don't have handy.  Deft questioning & a knowledge of the medium will assist you in suggesting something they may like."

"You would feel like the only thing you can think about is that person beyond a simple crush stage. Love is one of the most reconized entities that cant be seen with the eye. Its there but you cant see it. When you have a feeling for a person that takes over every possible thing in the worlds importance but that, LOVE. Nothing else matters in the world but that feeling for a person, LOVE. Love is a chemical release in the brain that tells you ""more!"" Love is a natural high, drug and emotion."

"I was also at the screening at the Arclight theaters and I have to say how bad it really was. It was trying so hard to be the next great American horror film. The music was so redundant and overdone. And yes there were little girls with long black hair AGAIN in some scenes. The POV of the spirit is the lamest thing I've ever seen. It's also very redundant. The whole dream/nightmare/memory thing...whatever it was...felt so unnecessary and redundant. There's so much redundancy and boredom to this film. The only reason why I jumped at some parts and many times why I do this in horror movies is because of the loud music. Who doesn't jump at sudden bursts of trumpet sounds? And Rachel-Hurd Wood was not that great either. She was much more believable in Peter Pan. She needed a rougher edge to her character and I think her innocence in real life bleeds through too much in her character. There was also a very awkward scene where she does the whole ""twitching-I'm possessed-help me"" act and the family is just staring and edited in a way that makes them look so careless. I couldn't help but laugh. Her whole twitching thing looked so fake as well. For some reason that moment totally made me picture the director shouting out his commands ""scream! shake harder..HARDER!!"" And Donald Sutherland can not act in this as well. And Sissy Spacek I feel like just wants money. She hasn't been in anything good since In the Bedroom. Story's pretty weird. For devil's sake....it's the same director as Dungeons and Dragons. He was ranting on to a select few of us outside the theater of the plot points and why people did this and that. No one can possibly know that the first viewing. Ok..enough of my ranting. I think with a lot of smart editing, and different choices of music placing, this film can be somewhat good."

No. I haven't seen it. The movie is rated R for brutal scenes of torture and violence, strong sexual content, language, and drug use. Due to the graphic nature of this film, its showing has been restricted in certain countries, primarily those with strict censorship policies. Quentin Tarantino co-produced it. No, the story is based on backpackers staying in a hostel. The film was set in \nSlovakia but filmed in the Czech republic and provoked a strong reaction in Slovakia.
NO i LOVE THAT SONG!
No -stolen\nYes-lied\nYes-broke your heart\nYes-cheated how do you get even? just forgive? \n\nI personally felt that I never truly got even. She ended up getting the better end of the stick.She made the wrong choices though, and she paid for them in the forms of verbal and physical abuse, but that wasn't due to me. She was booksmart, but dumb as a box of rocks when it came to being Street Smart. \n\nForgive?? No, not at all. When you lose your Best Friend and Girlfriend in the same day, and find out that they have been lying and cheating, and are living a totally different life than of the one you know, then in my opinion, there is no forgiving.

Is this a riddle?

I havent heard anything about it in a long time.  Last I heard was through a guy named Dan Kinno.  He is a young comedian that performed at my University.  He said he signed on for a small role and the sequal was supposed to be called Harold and Kumar Got To Amsterdam.  Thats all I had ever really heard about it.  I dont know if it is still planned or not.
Try using Google. search for 80's commercials. I came across a person selling many CD's of 70's and 80's commercials. I bought a set that contained Saturday Morning commercials. The quality isn't that great, and it appears that the commercials were copied off of VHS tapes. But if you can get past that, it brings back a lot of memories.

Check bulletin boards at music stores and put up one of your own saying what you play and what musicians you're looking for, what style of music you want to play etc. That's how most bands are started. \n\nAlso check the music classifieds on MySpace (they are region specific and have a lot of young musicians in them) or can do a Yahoo or Google search for Musician's Classifieds, alot of them will have different pages for specific cities and some of them have young musicians too.
Oboe is an instrument that takes a while to build up good tone. It isnt an instrument like clarinet or saxophone in which good tone tends to come quicker.  You just need patience! Keep practicing. Listen to recordings of other oboists and find things in their sound that you like and try to imitate them or keep their sound in mind while you practice. Some good people to listen to are Alex Klein, John Mack, Mark Weiger (he is my oboe teacher! has a couple cds out, VERY VERY GOOD) and Allen Vogel just to name a few!\nAlso, if you arent currently taking private lessons, look for an teacher! A good place to look is in the music department of a local college. Chances are there will be a couple oboe majors looking for students! Good luck and keep up the good work!\n\n**Edit**\nThe comment about sax and clarinet tone being easier is a fact. The first sound out of one of those instruments is a lot prettier than the first sounds out of an oboe. I have numerous years of experience on sax and clarinet so I know. In reference to dropping your jaw, it depends on how your embouchure is. That doesnt always work for everyone. Dropping your jaw will help if you have a very pinched sound or if your pitch is on the sharp side. Rounded out your embouchure will help give you a fuller sound if you bite too much. Other people's embouchures tend to be too loose though and causes the sound to be very thin and airy. Your best bet is to just get a private teacher and see what they say! It's hard to make embochure adjustments without seeing the player or hearing them.

HERE ARE MY TOP THREE:\n\n(1)Laugh as often as possible. ~\nLaughter releases endorphins, the body's natural pain killers. Laughter lowers blood pressure, reduces stress hormones and boosts your immune function.\n\n(2)You need a friend. ~\nFriendship is not a luxury, but is essential to work-life balance and your health. Studies show isolation decreases immune functioning.\n\n(3) Maintain an attitude of gratitude. ~\nIt's impossible to be grateful and experience stress at the same time. Studies tell us daily gratitude exercises result in higher levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, optimism and energy.
It just means that the woman is so special, so classy, so refined that she stands out. She is the most elegant and graceful woman you have ever known, she is three times a lady. The definition of a lady is a woman who has high standards of proper behavior, is well-mannered, polite, not to mention gorgeous...she is somewhat like a queen.\n\nLionel Richie was singing about a really special woman who made him really good. Three times a lady.

Cancer and Capricorn \n\nWhen Cancer and Capricorn come together, it's a union characterized by tenacity and strong willpower. Capricorn is logical and down to earth; Cancer brings an emotional charge to the relationship . Both have high standards for each other which are tempered by mutual respect. Cancer appreciates Capricorn's dedication and Capricorn admires the tenacity of the Crab. Together, this will be a very successful and secure duo. \nThis relationship has a strong foundation based on material and emotional security. Both Signs are dependable and conservative. Cancer can help Capricorn to relax a little and appreciate the rewards of labor. Cancer will also be the one to polish and preserve the fruits of their shared accomplishments. Capricorn can help Cancer achieve goals and keep a check on their Crab-like tendencies, enlightening Cancer to the more important matters of the world. This partnership succeeds due to an iron-clad commitment and a stable, traditional home environment. \n\nCancer is ruled by the Moon and Capricorn is ruled by Saturn. The Moon is a warm, feminine energy and Saturn a cold masculine energy. The Moon is emotional and nurturing; it is about maternal care-giving and intuition, both of which are important to Cancer. Saturn is using integrity and discipline to achieve goals. Cancer will show Capricorn how to enjoy life and how to appreciate beauty and comfort. Cancer soothes Capricorn's hard edges, while the Seagoat provides a solid foundation that Cancer desperately craves. Capricorn can teach Cancer to be more disciplined and to go out into the world and strive toward goals. Cancer is a Water Sign and Capricorn is an Earth Sign. Earth Signs are about possessions, and the Cancer-Capricorn partners usually surround themselves with beautiful things -- a stately home, gorgeous artwork, expensive cars. Their desire to be economically stable and their love of finery ensures that this couple will work hard toward this and other shared goals. Additionally, they are a practical pair, and they rarely have problems caused by one partner trying to live ostentatiously or beyond their means. \n\nCancer and Capricorn are Cardinal Signs. Both are initiatory, active and ardent. Though this can be a catalyst for some dynamite conflicts, it can provide Capricorn with an emotional pillar, as Cancer is entirely dedicated to the relationship. In turn, both can bring new ideas to the table, Capricorn excelling in business and Cancer in emotional counseling. These Signs will work well together if Capricorn and Cancer can each work in their own area of expertise. \n\nThe best aspect of the Cancer-Capricorn relationship is their utter dedication to each other and their mutual commitments toward the same goals. Both partners enjoy luxury and nice things, and aren't afraid of a little hard work to get them. Their mutual interests, stringent morality and upward spiraling make theirs a highly compatible relationship

"Some technical elements:\n\n1) Use of deep focus - deep focus allowed the camera to see the background as sharply as the foreground. Welles made good use of this. \n\nFor example, in the scene where Susan tries to kill herself. Welles implies to us what she did in just one shot, because you can see the medicine bottle in the foreground, Susan lying down in the ""mid-ground"", and the locked door in the background; this all implies that she tried to kill herself. If Welles didn't use deep focus, such a shot (and such economy of shots) would be impossible.\n\n2) Jump cuts - you can see this in the scene where Kane says ""Merry Christmas"" to Thatcher, then it cuts to a scene many years later, where Thatcher says ""And a Happy New Year"".\n\nWelles used jump cuts creatively in this film, such as the example above. It is a joy to see how freshly he uses jump cuts (and other techniques) in this film, even though the movie is decades old.\n\nSome symbolism:\n\n1) When came walks past the hall of mirrors, I think the image shows us how many faces Kane had in his life, and which one is the real Kane? Who knows? \n\n2) When the smoke rises to the sky during the last shots of the movie, I think the shot is saying to us ""Look... Kane had so much possessions in his life... But so what? All of it is fleeting just like that smoke""."

I want to f**k a dog in the a**! that song is the funniest,nextto anything by John Valby.
The most exciting (and scary) thing that I did was back in high school when I went on this huge 3 day bushwalk.  Where I live in Australia (Tasmania) the bush is notorius for being very tough and dangerous.  It was the hardest damn thing I ever did, it was full on and the pack i was carrying was so so heavy so i had a few teary and sore shoulder moments.  But it was the best thing that I ever did, it showed me how beautiful the world is and how different it is without all the luxurys that we are used to (shower, tap water etc...).  It was hard walking but great fun camping with all my school friends (I was about 14 at the time) and its something that I will never forget. The best thing was that I could look back and say wow, i actually did that!\n\nCollege (here in Australia, college refers to grade 11 and 12- i noticed that what Americans call 'college' we call university), anyway college days were the best days of my life, coming out of high school, meeting heaps of new friends and not having to worry about teachers so much was great,  I met friends there that are my friends for life.  We had so much fun, going away on trips together, going out clubbing when we turned 18, parties every weekend, meeting lots of new cute guys (hehe!).  I look back now and those were the best days of my life!\n\nAs for you, depending on how old you are, do something that u love, or get involved in a club or sport that you love.  That will give you lots of exciting things to do and u will meet heaps of great people with the same intersts who want to do exciting things as well! U can do anything u want if u put your mind to it and really want it, u can learn to juggle, go on a bushwalk, climb a mountain, go on a trip away, go orienteering (join scouts or something), go on camps, do gymnastics and learn heaps of cool tricks, there is so so much to do out there! Goodluck!

listen to older drumers, like from Rush or Led Zepplin(sp?)  study them and try some of the more complex beats.   you'll probably not be able to keep up, but its great inspiration.  also dont be scared to learn jazz, blues, rock, even folk.  some of the best drummers in the world are trained in multipal styles
A lot of songs by the Beatles, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Kinks, Crosby Stills Nash & Young, the Eagles, and even some Rolling Stones sound fine played on an acoustic guitar.

Beverly Clearly books they rock trust me i am your age
It was a good cinematic version of the AWESOME broadway play. I saw the show live and loved it....then saw the movie. They are both great in different ways. The movie gave you more of a realistic view of what the characters were going through, but still, nothing compares to the energy you feel when you see it live.
Yeah, almost forgot about that. \n\nWith Windsor Davies as the sergant major ball. Class.
Yes, they are legal, and in most cases, they do work, just like any other ringtone, you download them into the phone.  However, BEWARE of anything that is free.  I do technical support for one of the top three cellular phone companies, and our particular company's policy is to warn our customers about using these websites.  For several reasons,  one being that when you go to these website, you usually end up getting set up on some kind of monthly alert for new ringtones.  They come as text messages, and can cost you as much as $20 a month.  Also, your cell phone company should have a homepage, and links to downloads from that homepage.  Only those links from that home page are safe and protected from virus, worm, etc.  If you go to any other site on your phone, you are just as subject to pick up a virus as if you were on a regular pc.  I'm not saying they are all bad, of course.  Just use caution.

That light-up fretboard seems like a gimmick.  For its $600 list price, you could get a much better electric guitar and learn it the regular way.\n\nI recommend the G&L Tribute series guitars.  They have good electronics and good workmanship, and play well.  It's important for a beginner to have a guitar that plays easily and feels good; otherwise it's not enjoyable and you won't want to keep practicing.

A DVD Recorder
"Okay, it's going to cost a little bit more, but you need to upgrade to digital cable with DVR. Having tons of shows at your fingertips ""On Demand"" will mean that you never have to sit through stuff you don't want to watch ever again. When you add the Digital Video Recorder to the package you can record all the shows you're not home to watch and view them at your leisure.\n\nI work very odd hours and these options have revolutionized the way I watch TV. Also consider that On Demand programming is commercial free and that you can fast-forward through the ads you have recorded, and you will also spend less time watching TV all told.\n\nDo it."
Well, if you get a chance, watch the movie Easy Rider...the campfire scene with Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda was filmed as the actors smoked actual marajuana.  In most cases, tobacco or sage is used.

I'd pick you up in my ferrari and drive like a madman to the chopper that's parked outside Buckinghame palace, where the queen has been standing for 1 hour (in the cold with just her slippers & cardie on) waiting to wave you off.  After hovering above a few streets throwing large denomination notes to passers by we zoom off to our lear jet, parked at Heathrow, where a brass band plays a farewell to you.  On board we party like hollywood celebs whilst we fly to our private island (just off Miami - I had it specially built).  Once there we spend a few hours playing elephant polo with European royalty to relax, perhaps having a swim in the solid diamond pool filled with expensive champagne.  Then, after a vigerous rub down from Brad Pitt your whisked off on the back of a Harley Davidson (Ewan McGregor driving this time) to Las Vegas where we blow a couple of million in the casinos.  After arriving in Tokyo a few hours later (party all the way)on concorde (which I had specially re-instated for a one off flight, compliments of the British government), The Time life magazines top 500 most influencial people sing happy birthday to you, whilst a TV screen shows George Bush and Osama Bin Laden shaking hands and agreeing that your birthday has ushered forth a new era in world peace, whilst the pope tap dances in the background holding a card saying 'God bless you and your birthday'.  As a small finale the citizens of the middle east form the words 'God bless this day, Happy Birthday' in candle light.\n\nOh yeah, and George Clooney would appear to you in the firework celebration in the form of a large animated display, portraying him giving you a movie style kiss.  Whilst you were watching that he would secretly be getting your name tatooed on his arm and trying to gather the guts to ask you out on a date.\n\nHow does that sound?
If you mean the book, it's already out! If your talking about the movie, we still have to wait at least another year or 2.
Study your butt off today...   Or practice your programming depending on what type of Computer test it is..

"Although we never learn exactly what he does down at the ""salt mines"", we do know that Ward Cleaver is a responsible businessman and an even more responsible parent. He is generally even-tempered, though he occasionally blows his stack with the kids or at the office when Fred Rutherford pushes him over the edge. An exceptional TV dad, Ward doesn't gloat when he's right about something, and will always admit when he's wrong. He loves his family, and shows it by being attentive and levelheaded.\n\nWard grew up on a farm and had a grandfather who was a Civil War hero. He became president of his fraternity at State College (which he attended with bride-to-be June Bronson) and was an engineer with the Seabees during World War II."

it requires some intensive film viewing in the past years matched  with critics reading .If you are snobbish enough or against mainstream movies,commercial work-out here are some sites you can check out critics .Also you can trust other people's opinion on different blogs or www.imdb.com.And finally you'll see that you can determinate in the end the style of one movie which is not always about the genre:comedy,drama,romance but also about the realism,purpose,playwright.it's not tough especially if you love movies.Why did i say intensive film viewing for a while: because after some time you'll define your style and become quickly bored with the same plot or cliche lines and in the end you'll be your own sleuth for a new good movie.

"cause he's an alchoholic\n\nthe connection with corn liquor produced in the South, since corn is ""cracked"" before being mixed with other ingredients and fermented into alcohol. In the US, this industry is strongly associated with Southern states, especially the illegal ""moonshine"" corn whiskey that was produced secretly to avoid government taxation in the 1800s. On a recent visit to my parents, who live down in North Carolina, we visited a cultural museum where one of the featured exhibits was a still (the equipment for producing corn whiskey.) To the best of my knowledge, there are no stills in museums up here in Boston. Most sources that believe this to be the root of the word point to song The Blue Tail Fly (more popularly known as Jimmy Crack Corn) which tells the story of a slave who escapes punishment when his master is killed in a riding accident - even though it happened because he failed to keep flies from biting the master's nervous horse."

Your best bet would be to go to www.imdb.com and look up whatever show it is you're looking for.  To test it I typed in harvy birdman, simpsons, and muppet babies (haha, thought I'd go for something I didn't think I'd find, but amazingly I did).  So if I could find info for those 3, I'm sure you can find info on the voices of the characters, as long as it's probably not too new.  Hope that helps.

I was so sad to see it end.  But I'm glad I did.  As they were playing parts of the old episodes it brought back old memories.  I just didn't understand why Mary couldn't be there.

I think you should start a website on your own.  You can recruit a nerd to help you or just do it yourself.  Post your songs on the site.\n\nCreate a music video and insert the address of the website at the end and post it on popular video sharing sites like Google video or Metacafe.  Instant exposure.

Pete Wentz because i think it would be cool to hang out with a person that plays the same instrument  as me and i just wanna hang with him cuz fall out boy is my favorite band ever and Pete... my favorite bass player ever.
Good for you dude, I started playing when I was 15..I'm 34 now and can play like nobodies business. An electric guitar is the way to go when starting out. The string guage is much lighter, which makes it allot easier to fret. After you learn some stuff, it is good to play acoustic because it will build finger strength (much more pressure needed to play acoustic), which in turn will make you a stronger electric player.

Comparing the two is somewhat ridiculous. But the one major thing they have in common is that they make bubblegum pop music. Evanesence is probably better because they have at least some musical skills and write their own songs. But they aren't that much better. Amy Lee has a horrific voice and she proudly displays her horrific voice at live shows. Without any shame.

"I agree!!!!!! Finally someone with a lil sense that is not posting dumb a$$ questions like  ""WHO THINKS 50 CENT IS HOT?"". 50 SUCKS! I work in radio and I HATE having to play his crap during my show. \n\nP.S.... MOS DEF IS MY FAVORITE!!!!! :o)\n\nPPS... Deuce Iverson.... CIARA is not a rapper. She sings. And she's not from the ""streets"". She started off modeling. Thats not gangsta. SHAKIRA is not a rapper! And she is from Columbia. Thats not gangsta either. And Chamillionaire has been around for about 5 minutes. He's not the greatest. He hasn't been around long enought. At least the Tupac and Biggie thing makes more sense... but I'm pretty sure you're just saying that because its something you heard while looking at BET or MTV, or maybe reading in your Word Up! Magazine. Sorry, but you're a dumb a$$ too. \n\nI swear, I understand its entertainment... but its amazing how many people know NOTHING about music. 50 Cent is no where near the best rapper. His lyrical content SUCKS! T.I. is not the greatest.... AT ALL. He makes good songs... but he's no where near the best. \n\nI work in radio, and I'm telling you... TURN OFF YOUR RADIOS and TVS if you want to know what real rap and hip hop is."

Ok I TOTALLY AGREE! I HATE KATHERINE. I loved Chris so much, that I almost stopped watching. Katherine has screwed up soo many times...and when she was in the top 4! That should have been an automatic off. Her parents drive me crazy. When Elliot got voted off, they were like YES YEAH GO KATHERINE...um...inapporpriate at the time! TOTALLY. She is ugly, she flops around on the floor like a dead fish, she can't dance, she wears clothes that are too tight and they show her rolls over the undergarment. Plus, she's NOT THAT TALENTED. I mean she is OK...but not as good as some. Ok..enough of me going off...I just really don't like her. So my votes go to TaYLor. SOUL PATROL! :)

You should go see a modeling agent but not one who wants you to pay upfront nope never! one who wants a percentage is the best bet. I was a model for 3 years (FUBU, FORDS, I got offered GUESS!)

I think that Taylor Hicks will win American Idol 2006 and he will be the second winner of American Idol from Alabama after Ruben Studdard.

Cruel intentions?   But that was actually step brother and step sister betting that he could get the bookworm but the steps ended up sleeping together and he died at the end of the movie.

They are actually Jor-El's underwear, which Superman wears to honor his late father & the entire Kryptonian race.  However, since no one wants to wear the same underwear that covered the junk that helped to conceive him, & have it pressed against his own junk, especially since his father's junk also touched his mother's junk, Superman decided to wear these outside his tights.  That way, he could honor his father, but not feel all dirty about it.\nIn an ironic twist of fate, Superman saved a young girl during the 70s.  She, too, wondered about the underwear outside the clothes.  She also thought that was a very bold & inspiring fashion statement.  Therefore, she also decided when she got older, she would occasionally wear her underwear on the outside of her clothes to honor the Man of Steel who saved her life, on those rare occasions when she would wear any underwear.  Today, we know this woman as Madonna.
shakira, she's got a better voice, unique too thats a for sure.
"I love that movie. I have been a Cusack fan since Say Anything and I think High Fidelity is one of the funniest movies about relationships I have ever seen. Jack Black making fun of the guy who wants to buy ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"" and the fantasy scene where they hit Tim Robbins's character with the cash register always crack me up. Definitely one of my top movies. I went to see About A Boy because it was also written by Nick Hornby and it is extremely funny as well."

"All three are Fabulous Artists, with just incredible talent!! They all three, amaze me beyond belief! Robert DeNiro is the type I would love anything he does, because I love him as an actor! He's handsome, in a good way to me. Al Pacino, does good Bad Guy stuff, and very good at it, love all his movies. Now, Tom Hanks is a unique type. I've actually been told I look just like Jenny in ""Forrest Gump"" Robin Wright, is her name, she's married to Sean Penn. But, Tom Hanks, is the top of all three to me! That man can do anything, and  be up for Oscars, everytime!! I just love, love, love Tom Hanks. He's such a kind soul, in real life too."

Hmmm...recorded by Chet Atkins...during my time...about 30 years ago but not my kind of song.\n\nFrog Kissin'\n\n\nDo you remember in the fairy tale, how the wicked witches spell\nTurned the handsome prince to a toad?\nBy the power of a potion, she handed him the notion\nHe was lower than the dirt in the road.\nAnd though she left him green and warted, her evil plans were thwarted\nTheir chanced to happen by a young miss\nWho inspite of his complexion, offered him affection\nAnd broke the wicked curse with her kiss \n\n\nSo if you've never been frog kissing\nThen you don't know what you've been missin',\nThere's a wealth of opportunity under each and every log.\nAnd if you've never been charm-breakin',\nThen you've never been handsome prince makin'.\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a frog!\n\nOnce upon a time ago, I was down and feelin' low\nLike a lonely frog in a pond\nMy life was just a joke, and I was just about to croak\nCuz I'd be zapped by life's wicked wand.\nBut in the depths of my depression, there came a true expression\nOf love from a person so sweet.\nShe gave me warm fuzzy feelings, feelings that were healin'\nAnd she knocked me off my little webbed feet.\n\nThere's a happy-ever-after-land, deep in the heart of man\nWhere a prince and princess abides.\nBut all we get are glimpses, of the happy prince or princess\n'Cauce they're covered with a green warty hide.\nThough they're full of life's potential, they're lacking one essential\nTo enable them to shine like a star.\nThat's a handsome guy or missus, to smother them with kisses\nAnd love them just the way that they are.\n\nThat's the secret of frog kissing\nYou can do it too if you'll just listen\nThere's a wealth of opportunity under each and every log.\nThat's the secret of charm-breakin',\nThat's the secret of handsome prince makin'.\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a...\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a...\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a frog!

"This is a gentle, innocent film about the reflections of an aging man (David Morse), who returns to his home town after the death of his best friend. Memories of life at age 11 floods back as it was a magical time that changed his life. Three 11 year old children (Anton Yelchin as Bobby, Mika Boorem as Carol, and Will Rothaar as Sully) share their lives. Carol & Bobby have a special affection for one another including sharing a kiss ""by which all others will be measured"". Bobby lives with his mother (Hope Davis), a bitter, vain woman who looks for pleasures for herself without sharing much with her son. Into their lives comes a mysterious new boarder (Anthony Hopkins), who befriends the boy but generates distrust from the mother. As time passes, the man and boy share confidences and special powers are revealed. The man warns the boy to be on the lookout for the ""lowmen"", who were seeking him. The two share a summer's adventures and come to love one another before the inevitable happens. A confrontation with a school bully (Timothy Reifsnyder) also changes everyone.this the film but u get the plot!!!!"

"Why do you care so much about what everyone else is always worrying about?  Take your own advice: ""Find something else to worry about like your own life, [nobody else has]  anything to do with you.""  \n\nI am sick of hearing, people such as yourself, complain about people complaining about celebrities.  In retrospect, isn't it the same thing? What makes it OK for you to ""talk s***"" about ""everyone"" else, but not OK for ""everyone"" else to talk s*** about celebrities? Obviously if, Tom and Katie, Brad, Jennifer, and Angelina (you state their names as though you know them), didn't want the attention, they wouldn't have pursued such career option; as a Hollywood 'celebrity' they put themselves out there, as did Rita Haywood, Frank Sinatra, Grace Kelly, Mary Tyler Moore- this isn't anything new!  So do yourself a favor, and 'mind your own.'\n\nAnd actually, your absolutely wrong when you say ""nothing any of these celebrities are doing has anything to do with you"", because they are making tacky, movies, ( & videos, and music), that they do want ""everyone"" to buy into, therefore, they are asking for my, and everyone else's criticsm."

"Peter Noone [awwww] started the official site Hermans Hermits in 2000 - the link is http://www.hermanshermits.com/ ENJOY! =)\n\nThe Beatles broke up in 1970, and Lennon followed with a solo career marked by uneven recordings and public pleas for world peace. After a reclusive five years as a family man, Lennon released an album with Yoko in 1980, Double Fantasy. As their new song ""Just Like Starting Over"" was reaching the top of the charts, Lennon was shot to death outside his New York home by Mark David Chapman, a schizophrenic fan."
There's some truth to a lot of what's been said here. They come from the heart when they speak. They do fight and forget. I'm not sure about the in bed part from the earlier answer given, though I've had no complaints either. Speaking for myself, when in an arguement, it takes me a long time to get to a heated arguement, but when I get heated, it also takes a while to cool down. I don't argue about petty things, but choose my arguements more carefully (Though there are always some hot-button issues). I'd sacrific anything for my family. I'm not needy, and I'm not dependent on another person for my own happiness either.

"Absolutely not!  It will be difficult, but it is a difficult field for folks of ANY age to break into.  Think of all the experience you have had at life that you can use to pull material from?  Jobs, relationships, trips, housing situations.  If this is what you dream about doing, don't let age stop you.  That is just finding an excuse to not face your fears.  Think of how many stand up comedians have become ""famous"" within their first 5 years of working?  So you may be 45 when you are famous.  Big deal, you have a whole lot of life left.  You should spend it in a way that makes you happy.  Do you want to look back at 80 and wonder if that guy on Y! answers was right 40 years ago?"
I think Tom Cruise is a huge part of the reason. He has pushed his profile, beliefs, money, power and self righteous judgements onto the world so profusely that people in general are not wanting to hear, see or support anything connected to him. I have not seen the movie, however the majority of people I have heard that have are far from excited with it. So word of mouth would have an effect om whether others choose to see it. Personally I'm going to give it one huge miss. I don't like his acting anymore than his personality. I think his biggest fan is himself.
He's still alive.
Direct TV all the way. You have more channel choices and my favorite part is the information display so you actually know what you are watching, what it is about, if it is a repeat, etc. As far as HD if you are a new customer to Direct TV you get a lot of incentives (such as free HD reciever) I just signed up last month and it makes a huge difference. Right now, DirectTv only has a small handful of HD channels, but they have recently installed a new satellite and HD users are supposed to get a largely expanded choice of HD channels in June i think.

I do! It is important to test the limits of what is known. That is how our knowledge of ourselves as well as our environment continues to grow. He made it a little over 7 minutes. The record is 8:58 minutes.He still has something to shoot for. Peace.
A buddy of mine watches the show and got me into it as he was telling me the story, and the Sasuke character rocks. I've always found that the second, or co-lead characters in either anime or American comics tend to have a little more depth and interesting background story than the lead. Primarily I believe this fact exist because the creator is trying to give the co-leads some audience appeal, from Sasuke's outfit color combination to his fighting abilities and origin this character is off the chain.\nPeace.
I like George. He's so good with the patients. He seems to be just an average guy that you might find living next door, plus he's cute in a lost puppy dog kind of way.\n\nAlso really like Dr. Bailey, I get a kick out of her don't-mess-with-me attitude.
It's not Rocky Montolla.  The song is Rocky Mountain High by John Denver.  Something like this rocky mountain high in Colorado.
"Jack is my favorite. They all need someone level-headed like him to lead the tribe. He balances out the other characters who get frequently caught up in their emotions.\n\nI like when Sawyer shows his ""nice"" side and helps out the tribe with something.. like on the last episode when he gave them the heroin for Libby. I crack up whenever I see him reading something with those homemade granny glasses."
Be happy, kiss him back and  enjoy!

Do you mean “The Good Humor Man” ? There are two. One was released in the 1950’s and was directed by Lloyd Bacon. The other was released in 2005 which was directed by Tenney Fairchild. As of right now, both are unavailable to purchase on DVD or VHS. However you can go to www.videoeta.com and click on search, type in the name of this movie, click on which version you’d like, hit the notify me button on either DVD or VHS… and the rest is explained.

Neil Peart is is up there with the best drummers of all time. Tommy Lee isn't fit to clean his sticks. I can't believe you had to ask! You should be ashamed of yourself and as a pennance, you will be forced to listen to Motley Crue's mince until you realise the error of your ways. Only once you have repented, will you be allowed to listen to Rush.

I don't think so i think the child is going to be beautiful but you wont be blinded by its beauty.The thing with being famous is it doesn't matter if you are unattractive as long as you famous and you've got money you are the most gorgeous person.That's what Ive noticed because they are some celebrities who i find very unattractive but people praise them and sit saying oh my God she is glamorous,beautiful and that bone structure,blah blah blah.

"Good morning Pd. Thankyou for sharing your concept of Y/A. I, too, browse the questions, much like a bee hovers over the flowers, picking and choosing. You must be one of those people who work while everybody else is sleeping. I did that myself for many years. I noticed from your profile that you often share a joke with Y/A ""peeps"" so I thought I'd start your day off with one from me. Hope you like it.\n\nHave you seen the new study released by the American Psychiatric Association? Its a survey about how women feel about their a$$es. The results were interesting:\n\n1. 85% of women surveyed feel their a$$es are too big.\n2. 10% of women surveyed feel their a$$es are too small.\n3. 5% of women surveyed say they don't care, they love him, he's a good man and they would have married him anyway!\n\nHave a good one, Pd."

The new album seems political to me, Vicarious anyway. I'm more a music person and don't absorb the lyrics right away...so for 10,000 Days I've only had the album since 5/3/06 and really haven't focused on the lyrics yet. The drum and bass are classic Tool. I can't take it out of my car. I understand his pain and longing for a twisted relationship on the older albums lyrics. The band was very disconnected from their audience when I've seen them live. I understand needing people to keep back because they are freaking me out. Maynard puts out that vibe at 10 feet and in every song he performs.

I believe it was a matter transporter, they were made into tiny particles then, re-done on whatever planet they were in. I don't think they ever beamed anyone up in London. But I'm not a trekkie, so I wouldn't know.\nI am interested in science fiction though, such as time travel.

Based on his battle with the Avengers, I would have to say Graviton would win.  Graviton would be able to create a protective field to defend against Magneto's metal attacks.  Then Graviton would be able to either throw all kinds of non metal items at Magneto, or just crush Magneto using his gravity powers.
Erm... I'm not sure. I don't think there was enough heart in the movie for Lewis.
OMG, yes, don't get me wrong, he has introduced me to some hilarious cartoons, but there has got to be a limit. Especially when the kids are not home and my tv is still on the cartoon network!!\nMy bf's best friend is a Dragon Ball Z fanatic. He has a room in his home dedicated to it.\nI find it really funny, when my man starts telling me the personalities of characters in cartoon land. I thought it was because he is 6 yrs younger than me, but I guess I lot of guys get into it.?
It is a very tough question you asked my dear friend and for this reason i think no one gave any answer yet.

Hi!\nI  don't know what style of christian music your friends like, but here are some options-\nIf they like rock try: RED - End of Silence, It is really, really good.\nor you could try Skillet - Comatose, it's also good. Plumb - Chaotic Resolve, this was the best c.d. that came out this year! BarlowGirl - Another Journal Entry, not as good as their self-titled c.d. but still good. Sarah Brendel - (Self-Titled) She has a rather thick German accent, but it's worth listening to.\n\nIf they like Pop try: Krystal Meyers - Dying for a Heart, she sounds a little bit like Hillary Duff, but better. Natalie Grant - Awaken, this c.d. has a mix of all styles, but mostly pop. Nichloe Nordeman - Brave, this is a softer side of pop, but I love it. Jars of Clay - Good Monsters, this C.D. was rated c.d. of the year by CCM magazine. Rebecca St. James - If I Had One Chance to Tell You Something, she is more rocky that pop, but really good. Ana Laura - (Self-Titled) Softer pop, good.\n\nIf they like softer stuff try: Leigh Nash - Blue on Blue, she was the lead singer in Sixpence None the Richer. Michael W. Smith - Stand, I haven't heard this C.D. but, if you like Michael, you'll probably like this!\n\nIf they want Christmas music try - (Most of these C.D.'s are older,)Jump 5 - All the Joy in the World, classic bubble-gum music. Point of Grace - A Christmas Story or their new one - Winter Wonderland. Stacie Orrico - Christmas Wish, this is an E.P. with only 6 songs, but it's worth it. Natalie Grant - Believe, this is more of a Gospel type with strong vocals. Leigh Nash also just released a new Electronic E.P. that I think you can get at iTunes. Rebecca St. James - Christmas, a mix of traditional songs.\n\nThere, I hope this gives you some ideas!
yah! i do this thing where i chew the dirt out from under my nails! people hete it!!

Five years isn't that long ago.  I'm still about the same person I was then.  I've moved, taken a new position at work, divorced my wife, learned my daughter is bi (no biggy in that news), rode my bike a little more because I was in an area I knew quite well. But life's full of little changes and I can't wait for the next ones to come along.
i downloaded the songs from limewire and then decied to go out and but  teh soundtrack, it was worth the movie.  high school musical is awesome the songs are catchy and dancing was okay..espically the big girl who liked hip-hop. funny.  but totyal i have seen it 37 times and counting. i have a 10 year old that must watch it everyday.
If you have a really good voice and have loads of confidence then i dont see why not, get the contacts you need and you never know whats around the corners. Never say never!
you can download them on limewire or you can watch them for free on this cool website: http://movies.quicksilverscreen.com/watch-lost-episodes-online-free/

Of course you can wear your DVDs out....like everything else in this world the DVDs have got a lifecycle as well which according to the SONY web site is between 21 and 27 years depending on how often do you use them, where do you keep them (in terms of environment), is your DVD reader new or old (older readers scratch the discs far more often than new one, if the reader is more than 16-18 months old - consider it as very old one)....there are a DVDs which are called TITANIUM - they have a special cover which protects them. This way the DVD itself last longer

I think Leona should win. She is the only contestant with a top quality singing voice, besides Ray. I liked Ray at first, but  I'm getting pretty sick of his swing interpretations. It's not my favourite genre of music so that doesn't help much.\n\nITV is going down the pan by screening stuff like mediocre talent contests and non-celebs in some godforsaken jungle. Thank God we don't pay license fee for this dross! >_<

Well, first find out what kind of wood your cheapy guitar is.Then if you look it up and its basswood, or something decent, change some stuff around. Better tuners are always nice, nothing sucks more then bad tuners going out when your playing. I dont honestly think the nut is gonna help unless its seriously ruined. Pickups are nice, but none of this even matters if your using cheap cables, and a cheap amp too. Everything has to be good quality or theres really no point in adding to your guitar.I mean if you get let say a pair of emgs put in, they would normally be great mid-high range guitar tones, but if your amp doesnt have good distortion and sounds grainy, well your upgrade is only doing half of what it should.The cheapest thing on my list is cables-bad cables suck tone.You could also get a nice lil graphic eq, they can help a lot for a lil money.
It could not happen, if you found that many people stupid enough, they wouldn't be brave enough, most would run like f*ck, and the even more stupid of them who stayed would get squashed to death, are you planning on trying this little stunt, if so, will you be a runner, or a stay'er?

Same Old Lang Syne - Dan Fogelberg\n\nMet my old lover in the grocery store\nThe snow was falling Christmas Eve\nI stole behind her in the frozen foods\nAnd I touched her on the sleeve\n\nShe didn't recognize the face at first\nBut then her eyes flew open wide\nShe went to hug me and she spilled her purse\nAnd we laughed until we cried\n\nWe took her groceries to the checkout stand\nThe food was totaled up and bagged\nWe stood there lost in our embarrassment\nAs the conversation dragged\n\nWent to have ourselves a drink or two\nBut couldn't find an open bar\nWe bought a six-pack at the liquor store\nAnd we drank it in her car\n\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\n\nShe said she'd married her an architect\nWho kept her warm and safe and dry\nShe would have liked to say she loved the man\nBut she didn't like to lie\n\nI said the years had been a friend to her\nAnd that her eyes were still as blue\nBut in those eyes I wasn't sure if I\nSaw doubt or gratitude\n\nShe said she saw me in the record stores\nAnd that I must be doing well\nI said the audience was heavenly\nBut the traveling was hell\n\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to now\nAnd tried to reach beyond the emptiness\nBut neither one knew how\n\nWe drank a toast to innocence\nWe drank a toast to time\nReliving in our eloquence\nAnother 'auld lang syne'\n\nThe beer was empty and our tongues were tired\nAnd running out of things to say\nShe gave a kiss to me as I got out\nAnd I watched her drive away\n\nJust for a moment I was back at school\nAnd felt that old familiar pain\nAnd as I turned to make my way back home\nThe snow turned into rain

He is appearing in the world-wide smash hit ""Zombie Prom,"" a movie adaptation of the theatre show, which was released as an independent movie.  He also produced his own film ""Starrbooty"" which is being released to indie theatres soon.  \n\nRuPaul owns his own record label and production company and lives in New York.

I think it was the story he told her when she walked up on him about to stitch himself up....He wanted her to do it and she was afraid and he told her that when he was first doing surgery he was scared to death but he would only let the fear take hold of him for like 5 or 6 seconds and then he would let it go.  I think that is the story, but I am not 100%.

Finding Nemo ( after Captain Nemo) is an Academy Award-winning computer-animated film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released to theaters by Walt Disney Pictures and Buena Vista Distribution. It was released in the United States/Canada on May 30, 2003, in Australia on August 28, 2003, and in the UK on October 10, 2003. The movie is the fifth Disney/Pixar feature film and the first to be released during the summer season.\n\nThe movie was released on a two-disc DVD on November 4, 2003 in the United States and Canada, and in Australia on January 16, 2004. It went on to become the best selling DVD of all time at 28 million copies sold.\n\nFinding Nemo set a record as the highest grossing opening weekend for an animated feature, making $70 million (surpassed in 2004 by Shrek 2). It was, for a time, the highest grossing animated film of all time, eclipsing the record set by The Lion King. However, in less than four weeks of release, Shrek 2 surpassed Finding Nemo's domestic gross. By March 2004, Finding Nemo was one of the top ten highest-grossing films ever, having earned over $850 million US.\n\n\n[edit] Totals\nBudget: $90,000,000 \nMarketing cost: $4,000,000 \nOpening Weekend Gross (Domestic): $70,251,710 \nTotal Domestic Grosses: $339,714,978 \nTotal Overseas Grosses: $524,911,000 \nTotal Worldwide Grosses: $864,625,978 \n\nA clown fish named Marlin living in the Great Barrier Reef looses his son, Nemo after he ventures into the open sea, despite his fathers constant warnings about many of the Ocean's dangers, is abducted by a boat, and netted up and sent to a dentist's office in Sydney. So, while Marlin ventures off to try and retrieve Nemo, Marlin meets a fish named Dory, a blue tang suffering from short-term memory loss. The companions travel a great distance, encountering various dangerous sea creatures such as sharks, anglerfish and jellyfishes, in order to rescue Nemo from the dentist's office, which is situated by the Sydney Harbor. While the two are doing this, Nemo and the other sea animals in the dentist's fish tank plot a way to returning to Sydney Harbor to live their lives free again.

i heard there was some kind of false news report on the web about him dying some months back. i just could not believe it!! so i looked it up and it was there, seemed real. but no, he's not dead. he's very much alive and has been touring since that false story was reported. man, according to the net a lot of live people are dead, it's really sad!!
I think all kinds of crisis are possible in some form or another.\nBut i also think they're overrated to a great extent. I think people just get tired of the consistency of their lives so they go through a depression. They end up splurging on something crazy but it doesn't fulfill them because that's not what they really want. They just want some excitement and change. And that could happen by taking a road trip or something similar. Just anything to break up the routine. Like eating breakfast in bed one morning or jogging at a different time or doing something you've always wanted to do... Am i making ANY sense?
No,but i've just been singing it

"For their sun sign, they are either a Pisces or an Aquarius. I'm guessing that they are born on the cusp, but that still doesn't mean that they are both signs. If that person is a Pisces, then oh my, they are just full of water signs! All of the water signs are represented in each part of their major three placements!\n\nThey are probably going to be extremely emotional with lots of feelings. Inside, they're a water sign. Outside, they're a water sign. Their emotions are that of a water sign. I'm going to include some interpretations, not necessarily of love, but of just how having each of those placements will affect them.\n\nThis is from Bob Marks Astrology:\nMoon in Scorpio: The Moon is emotions and Scorpio is the sign of extremes and jealousy. Any questions? It goes without saying that these emotions have to be channeled into the right direction or there may be a few minor problems. On the positive side, this placement increases the emotional need for great sex.\n\nSun in Pisces: Aquarius is the genius who ""knows"". Pisces is the mystic who ""feels"". I call Pisces the most agreeable sign in the Zodiac, because whomever they meet, they agree with. Then they meet someone with the opposite opinion and agree with them too. Afterwards, they go off and do something totally different from either thing that they agreed with. They just don’t want to get into upsetting disagreements. Yes, of course there are many people with a Pisces Sun who will argue, but less than with any other placement. Usually, in those cases, you will find a strong Mars in the horoscope, or Saturn for firmness. Sun in Pisces increases imagination and sensitivity. It inclines to charity and taking care of the poor, sick, and unfortunate. Many of those poor, sick, and unfortunate also have strong Pisces or Neptune placements. Pisces can play both sides of the sympathy fence. More than other placements, it gives a far-away look to the eyes and the ability to just ""go off’. It is the only sign that can be alone in a crowded room.\n\nAnd Aquarius Sun, just incase they are an Aquarian sun instead of a Pisces:\n\nSun in Aquarius: The line between genius and madness is thin. Many people with the Sun in Aquarius have erased that line.Think of Carol Channing or Tommy Smothers if you want a picture of what the zany type is like. Ayn Rand and Angela Davis, the Marxist revolutionary, represent the type that is certain they have found the philosophical key to the Universe. Thomas Edison represents the truly revolutionary side of this position. So, in a lesser way, does Charles Lindburgh. Sometimes they see so far ahead that what they talk about seems totally crazy. Years later, they are, more often than not, proved right. Aquarius is the sign of friendship, and Aquarius Sun-Signs are frequently closer to their friends than their families. Jack Lemon once said in an interview, that his son was his ""best friend"". You could tell by the way he said it that he held ""friend"" in higher regard than ""son"".\n\n\nThis is from Astrology-Numerology.com:\nThe Moon rules the sign Cancer, and therefore is called the ruler of your horoscope. When the Moon is so predominate in a chart, it produces a personality that is sensitive and a little on the timid side. You like to feel out a situation before projecting yourself into it. The Moon is the indicator of emotions, the feelings, and the sensitivities. It is also closely related to the mothering instinct. You are very protective of those who are close to you, as you are protective of yourself. If you don't have a family around you to mother, you'll probably exhibit these characteristics with your friends. \n  \nBeing extremely receptive, you may be somewhat psychic or at least extremely sensitive to your environment. Your moods are very strong and changeable, much like the tides. You are ruled by your strong emotions and intuition. You can change moods in "

Sometimes sleep aides don't work if you are really uptight. You must turn your brain off, if you can.  Try meditating if you can, put all your problems into a basket.  Take them one at a time and place them in the basket, and when you are done, send them to God.  I used to put people I was worried about on a bus.  One by one I put them on the bus.  When they were all on the bus, I imagined God as the driver, and I let Him take them in His bus away to take care of them. It might help you.  Another way, is to visualize a white light above your head, concentrate on it, and see it, feel it and it's love. Bring it down through the top of your head, feel it's warmth and relaxing your brain. Then bring it down to your eyes, nose, mouth, neck, shoulders, torso, all the muscles you can imagine, on down to the legs, also through the arms, and hands, just keep on going to the feet. The more you can envision the better, then just relax each thing that you go to and relax it. By the time you are through, you will be relaxed. You have to only concentrate on each area of your body and nothing else. This works too. I believe it is part of Yoga. You must block out any other thing in your mind, and that means the things you are worrying about, or it won't work. P.S. I am not a guy as the picture shows, I am a older woman who has used this to block out cancer when I was being treated with radiation.  The inner meditation visualizing your inner self and fighting diseases also is encouraged by the cancer support groups. I have been cancer free 20 yrs. It was breast cancer, and I elected to not have them removed, it was early stage, but I did take radiation and surgery to only remove the small tumor. It does not work for everyone, this type of treatment, but do what your gut tells you, and also the doctor of course. I also took Tomoxifin for 5 yrs, but the stress of it coming back was with me for a very long time. Stress can kill, so try to control it as best you can.

"The season finale is May 18th: It's entitled, ""The Graduates"".\n\nSUMMARY OF EPISODE 21 entitled “The Dawn Patrol”\nAired: 4/13/06:\n\nIt’s dinner time at the Cohen household. Ryan and Seth whisper conspiratorially about the wisdom of Seth lying to Summer about Brown. Seth still stands behind his decision, but not so much that he wants to tell his parents about it. Kirsten mentions that tickets for graduation have come in, and Ryan suggests giving his to the Nana since he won’t be needing them. Kirsten thinks Ryan should maybe invite his mom. Ryan thinks maybe he should avoid the topic and hope it just goes away.\n\nLater, Kirsten drops in on the pool house, apologizing for making Ryan uncomfortable. But Ryan is actually aware of the reality of the situation. This could be his last chance to see his mom. So it’s off to Albuquerque. \n\nWhen Marissa gets out of the shower the next morning, Volchok is waiting in her bedroom. And he’s ready to get her out of that robe and get it on. But that will have to wait, because Julie’s in the doorway and she already doesn’t like Volchok. It’s cool. Volchok doesn’t have to stick around for this. Julie tells Marissa no more Volchok, which is usually just the impetus Marissa needs to do something. If anything, Julie should’ve told Marissa to marry Volchok. Then she would’ve dumped him before lunch.\n\nAt harbor, Summer glumly shuffles around the student lounge. Seth watches her longingly from a distance, but doesn’t say anything. Taylor takes in the scene and then joins Summer at her table. But not matter what optimistic viewpoint Taylor has to share, Summer doesn’t want to hear it. She’d rather rant and rave about what Seth did to her. She can’t figure it out either, because she’s gotten even hotter this year and there’s no way a guy like Seth could walk away from her unless he was hiding something. And she’s determined to get to the bottom of it. \n\nMatt’s enjoying a morning cocktail at the yacht club when Sandy arrives for a meeting they’d planned. Matt hands Sandy a projection of calculated future earnings, with a little pain and suffering cash thrown in. Either Matt gets his money from Griffin or he tells the DA about the documents he has on Griffin. Sandy realizes he’s being blackmailed for the second time in a week.\n\nMarissa drops by Volchok’s ultra cool loft to hang out. At the same time, Ryan arrives at a small diner in Albuquerque looking for his mother. But her shift doesn’t start for a couple of hours. He’ll be back. Dawn’s young coworker, Chloe, is more than pleased to see somebody as cute as Ryan show up. Hopefully she has a troubled past, or else Ryan just won’t be into her. \n\nMeanwhile, in calculus class, Summer frantically tries to get Seth’s attention. She then bursts out laughing and explains to the annoyed teacher that Seth’s dead-on impersonation of the teacher’s penguin walk was cracking her up. The teacher gives them both weekend detention. In the hallway, Summer explains that she broke up with him, she has the power to revoke said breakup. Which she is doing until he can sufficiently explain what his deal is lately. She kisses him and then reports to Dr. Kim’s office. Seth is slightly confused, to say the least.\n\nAfter nightfall, Ryan heads back to the diner. He sees his mom slinging club sandwiches and flirting with a biker and decides he’d rather not go in. But when he turns to leave, Chloe asks where he’s going. And if he’s not going inside, would he like to go somewhere with her? Indeed he would. \n\nJust then, Marissa and Volchok are about to go downtown when there’s a knock at the door. From outside, Julie calls out for Marissa. Marissa hides as Volchok lets Julie in. Julie explains to Volchok that’s he just one in a long line of Marissa’s phases, and it’s inevitable that she’ll wise up one day and leave him in the dust. Marissa overhears the entire conversation.\n"

"I reach deep into my ""Sol"" and belt out a good hardy laugh.  But not all the time... only when she shines her light ""just so"" and blasts her rays for all to see.  Unfortunately, where I live the sun likes to play hide-n-seek all the time.  So when she's out there... all alone in the sky.... beaming her radiant light... I know she's ready for a good time.  And so, I laugh.... and smile and enjoy each moment I have with her.  Until she decides to become reclusive again and hide behind the clouds."

First of all it's illegal.\nSecond, it's not a matter of votes but of educated votes.  An uneducated voter is a scary prospect and potentially quite detrimental to our community.  \nIf the fact that thousands of people have died throughout our history to establish our right to vote and millions of people around the world still have no say in their government is not enough to persuade someone to exercise their right than they don't deserve to vote.

"Whoa!!!! You really have missed out on ALOT!!! Way too much to catch you up on every detail. But yes Dan did kill Keith, but Keith didn't try to kill Dan. Deb started a fire in Dan's office trying to kill him. And yes, there was a school shooting. One of the guys from the river court, the one that helped Mouth out some, was ""being bullied"" and brought a gun to school. When the school was on lock down, Keith came in to talk him out of doing anything stupid and he shot himself. Then Dan, being mayor, went into the school and picked up the gun and killed Keith!!!  But it really is worth going and buying the dvds to catch up, you missed alot of good stuff!!!!!"

It’s a conjunction that many MySpace people use, which results in a truly horrific sentence.  It is pronounced “and and” and originated with programming languages, which use this command for short-circuit logical operations.  That said, the proper use of && (if so be one) would function much like the dash—this is the longer hyphen and demonstrated herein.\n\nThe ‘trendyXcore’ kids tend to misuse this punctuation by inserting it everywhere an ampersand is present.  It is not functional as such and is better used to replace a dash.

Leo. Congratulations\n\nLeo is the fifth Sign of the Zodiac. These folks are impossible to miss, since they love being center stage. Making an impression is Job One for Leos, and when you consider their personal magnetism, you see the job is quite easy. Leos are an ambitious lot, and their strength of purpose allows them to accomplish a great deal. The fact that these folks are also creative makes their endeavors fun for them and everyone else. It's quite common to see a Leo on stage or in Hollywood, since these folks never shy away from the limelight. They are also supremely talented and have a flair for the dramatic. Warmth and enthusiasm seems to seep from every Leo pore, making these folks a pleasure to be around. They do love pleasure!\n\nIt's the Lion which symbolizes Leos, and the king (or queen) of the jungle is a most appropriate mascot, since these folks consider themselves the rulers of their universe (and the Zodiac at that). Like Lions, Leos tend to be dignified and strong, and it is this sense of their power which allows them to get things done. A Leo on your team is a good thing, since Lions are eager to see their projects through to completion. Putting these folks at the helm is a good thing, too, since the Leo-born are natural leaders. They may ruffle a few feathers along the way, however, since they can also be overbearing and somewhat autocratic. This may be in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign -- Lions are indeed opinionated and set in their ways. That said, they are well organized, idealistic and have a knack for inspiring others.\n\nMost compatible sign: \nGemini Sagittarius, Aries, Libra\n\n\nCheck the link for your compatibility with other signs. Happy Hunting.
"A woman who worked in the next cubicle over from me was singing with the radio one day.  The song was John Mellencamp's ""Authority Song"" which says, ""I fight authority, authority always wins,"" but she was singing, ""I fight with Dorothy and Dorothy always wins.""\n\nI told my boss about it, and he admitted that he'd always messed up the old Rick Springfield song ""Don't Talk To Strangers.""   Where it says, ""Some sleek, continental dude,"" he thought it said, ""No sleep, but a nap will do."""

I don't know whether Kitty could go through Sue's force field. If she can't, Sue wins by default, just trap her in a bubble. If she is able to go through the force fields, Sue's in big trouble. Sue could fill the space around her with invisible force fields, so that Kitty wouldn't be able to solidify to attack her w/o harming herself. (I'm quite sure that Kitty can't selectively solidify one limb at a time, oslt.) But it would come down to a matter of timing, before they each were able to figure out each others' strengths and weaknesses.\n\nColossus vs. Thing is more difficult. Go to Marvel Directory and look up both of them, to see who is more powerful, strength wise. I'm inclined to say Ben Grimm will win. He is wiser, more mature and level headed.  Even if Colossus is stronger, Ben still has a good shot. He could talk the kid down. I just don't see Piotr as being so enraged that he would be willing to keep on attacking someone who was in his weight class and didn't want to fight. Ben would offer to buy them a round of beers, like he did with the Sandman. He knows how to turn an enemy into a friend.\n\n20 NOV 06, 1318 hrs, GMT.

sensual is all about feeling, it can be related to anything from comfy clothing, to silk sheets, to the touch of a loved one to the first drop of summer rain on ur skin\n\nit can also be related to smells and sounds
i feel driving is just for fun and it is useful cause we need not depend on others.
I thought it was great! A good change from the last couple that rely more on graphics and futuristic gadgets. A real hard hitting back to basics bond; just what they needed. I did think the slightly longer start was right though with the film showing how he became 007, so there was some justification to having it. I do agree the ending did seem to go on a bit.. I'm going to have to see it again soon. Loved the poker, stunts and the new gritty Bond character.
"hi there\n\nur 1st q about ""which ep has hikaru (one of the twins) stuck in the net with haruhi"" .... well, that one is in episode 21 :\n\nEpisode 21 - ""Until the Day when it Turns into a Pumpkin"" :""Itsuka Kabocha ni naru Hi made""\n\nIt's Halloween at Ouran High and Renge suggests they celebrate by having a Kimodameshi or test of courage. While the twins, Haruhi, and the class representative set things up, the rest of the Host Club and Nekozawa pull a halloween prank on them that results in the twins being separated. \n\n\nur 2nd question about haruhi dancing with host club members..that one is in the last episode (ep. 26)\n\nEpisode 26 - ""This Is Our Ouran Festival"" : ""Kore ga Oretachi no Ouran-sai""\n\nThe members of the Host Club race against time to stop Tamaki from leaving Japan and keep the club alive. \n\n\n:) :) :)"

"It's on yahoo's homepage.\n\n\n""Barbara Walters said Wednesday all is now ""well with the world"" following a flare-up earlier this week between Rosie O'Donnell and Kelly Ripa on ""The View."" \n\nRipa called in to the ABC daytime talk show after co-host O'Donnell accused her of making a homophobic comment to Clay Aiken, a guest host on ""Live With Regis and Kelly."" \n\nAiken covered Ripa's mouth with his hand during an interview on Friday's show. Ripa, 36, pushed his hand away. \n\nADVERTISEMENT\n \n \n""Oh, I'm in trouble,"" said the 27-year-old ""American Idol"" star, to which Ripa responded, ""No, I just don't I don't know where that hand's been, honey."" \n\nO'Donnell said Tuesday on ""The View"": ""If that was a straight man, if that was a cute man, if that was a guy that she didn't question his sexuality, she would have said a different thing."" \n\nRipa said O'Donnell misunderstood her remark. \n\n""He's shaking hands with everybody in the audience. I mean, it's cold and flu season. That's what I meant,"" she said. ""And to imply that it's anything homophobic is outrageous, Rosie, and you know better."" \n\n""I understand cold and flu season,"" O'Donnell replied. ""I'm just saying from where I sit as a gay person in the world, I have to tell you, that's how it came off to me."" \n\nAiken has been the target of speculation about his sexuality. Tabloid reports earlier this year suggested he had a gay affair. Aiken has never directly addressed the rumors. \n\nRoger Widynowski, Aiken's spokesman at RCA Records, declined comment on the Ripa-O'Donnell flare-up when contacted by The Associated Press. \n\nOn Wednesday's ""The View,"" Walters said, ""Rosie O'Donnell is one of the kindest, most sensitive people I know. And so is our friend Kelly Ripa. And Rosie and Kelly talked yesterday after the show. Rosie and Clay Aiken have talked. And all is well with the world, and all is well with them."" \n\nWalters said her speech was unrehearsed and that O'Donnell was unaware she was going to say something."""

Daisy Dukes by 69 Boyz.
I've given it a good listen, and must say that I'm not very impressed.  I enjoyed their earlier songs quite a bit, but with a single release like the queen and I, what were they thinking???  The attempt at using concrete metaphors in their lyrics has resulted with GCH recycling played out themes, and tired rhymes.  Why in god's name would you sing about myspace?  Sell out much?
"Yes there are I""m a 47 year old male and have read every book and seen every film. When the books are released I'm there at midnight getting mine. I don't stand in long lines at Barnes and Nobel or borders or some place like that. A lot of the older readers of the series have found out that the local supermarket also sells books, so maybe 15 or 20 of use stand in line inside the market in our PJ'S pick up the book speculate about the story line. Most of my friends read them in line while waiting to pay for them. But I don't I grab some snacks walk the half block home with some of my Harry Potter loving neighbors sit in my favorite chair and let the adventure begin. I also have all the films on DVD. If anyone thinks I need to get a life.....I do I go out with women quite often and enjoy their company very much I just happen to enjoy a great story as well."

I bet their love will not last forever coz both of them have their own history... \n\nBrad Pitt cheated on Jennifer Aniston while on the set filming with Angelina Jolie... So that's how they fall in love with each other... Besides, before he got married to Aniston, he also cheated on Gwyneth Paltrow eventhough they were already engaged at that time... So all I can say is I guess Brad Pitt likes to cheat on his girls when he's getting bored with them... Soon he will feel the same way too for Angelina Jolie...\n\nCheers... (^_^)

"I cannot believe how little some people really know about music…but I guess that’s what happens when MTV gets their hands on something.

You could do a great deal worse than download utorrent - or another torrent clinet and then check places like http://www.isohunt.com\n\nInterestingly, SOME TV programs (SouthPark) DO permit legal downloading f their material, once it has been aired. There may also be films of a certain vintage which again ARE legal to download.\n\nClearly there are others which would be illegal unless you already owned a right to have it (bough DVD but DVD no longer read) etc. For people like that, there are LOTS of the other films available too - including Bond films etc.

First, the Speedometer predates the Speed Limit.\n\nSecond, they tried reducing the numbers on the Speedometer and drivers didn't like it. In fact, they paid extra to buy racing gauges.\n\nAnd Third, speedometers are usually spring activated. The more the go to the right the more the spring is strained. Over time the sping gets spung and the needle begins to float and stick and give you inacurate readouts. So. if you keep the needle on the left hand side of the dial it should keep functioning longer and designing the dial to do so makes perfect sense.

In almost all cases the SUN sign is more important . . . no life on our Planet Earth without the Sun!\n\nAs the creating Yang force the Sun gives us our vitality, designates each individual character and shapes ones position in society. It is the center, the heart!\n\nThe Ascendant is the point on the eastern horizon at the time of birth and connects life on Earth to Cosmic Consciousness -- it is known as the *gate to the outer world* or *the path in life.* One can also call it the *assistant* instead of Ascendant (It assists the Sun).\n\nOnly in strong double sign combinations with the Sun in the 12th House is (can be) the Ascendant *stronger* than the Sun!\n\nAnything more is a professional consultation.

if you're talking about a movie in theaters, then it means that it is only playing in a few theaters. a limited movie usually only plays in big cities. many movies have limited openings at first and then open to a wider audience at a later date. other movies that are only limited sometimes open everywhere if they become popular. an example would be the movie little miss sunshine. it was limited at first, but became so popular that it eventually played in almost every theater.

"Ultimate must-have (IMHO) is ""Oh, Mercy"".\nDaniel Lanois produced this around the same time he also produced U2's ""Joshua Tree"" and The Neville Brothers ""Yellow Moon"" - an excellent man to have in the studio.\n\nAll the songs are vivid portraits of emotions and humanity.\nEach will be relevant years from now as they are today as they were when the CD was released (1989).\n\nSecond best must-have is ""Blood On The Tracks"".\nThis 1975 recording is raw emotion over a love that has gone south.\nPowerful lyrics and excellent musicians create a sound-scape into the heart and soul of Dylan.\nObviously, ""Tangled Up In Blue"" is the best song on that album (and perhaps Dylan's' best song ever, or at least in the top ten list), but listen to the other cuts and feel the vibe going on in this mans' heart and head."
I keep irregular hours. I'm not accountable to anyone, and it would be an adjustment to always let someone know where I am, what time I'll be home, etc. I like to do household chores at odd times.  I might drive someone else crazy!

"Numa Numa (or ""the Numa Numa Dance"") is an Internet phenomenon based on amateur videos, particularly one by Gary Brolsma, made for the song ""Dragostea din tei"" by Romanian pop band O-Zone.\n\nThe phrase ""Numa Numa"" comes from the chorus of the song, ""nu mă, nu mă iei,"" meaning, roughly, ""(you) won't take, won't take me.""\n\n\nNu mă, nu mă iei (""You don't, you don't take me"") becomes ""noma, noma yay!"" (""drink, drink, yay!"")"

Dont think they have been released yet, there are reports that Britney will give them away to Vanity Fair mag, She was supposed to sell them to People Mag like she did w pix of Sean Preston BUT the proceeds of the pix would go to Kevin. And since she has filed for divorce, she's playing hard ball, by threatening giving them away for free, meaning K-fed would make nada on the pix!

I love anime and Japanese movies! Akira is one of the classics and Ghost in the Shell is good. If you want more extreme go for Legend of the Overfiend (its a bit mental but a classic). \nCheck out Appleseed too, http://www.appleseedthemovie.com/,  that's worth a watch. \nI personally like some of the more extreme Japanese movies (not necessarily animated). One of my favourite directors is Takashi Miike - if you've got a strong stomach check out Ichi the Killer (there's an animated version too) and Audition. Happy viewing!
I am an Everwood fanatic and still have not managed to make myself delete the series finale from my TIVO.  Julia had a habit of buying important gifts way ahead of time in case anything ever should happen to her or Andy.  She had written that when Ephram was young.

Try to understand that if you based your viewing upon the bad traits of people in Hollywood and on TV, you wouldn't be going any movies or watching TV again.\n\nI really think the liberals are making too big of deal about this. It's sad, but a lot of people are racists.  It's time to drop it and move on, IMO.

She asked if he could hear her confession?\n\nVirgil granted her request and later met her in confessional.\n\nWhile listening to the young girl Virgil felt more than Priestly toward her ordeal.........he renounced his faith................

"OMG!! So much happened! Logan broke up with Veronica. Wallace, Piz, Mac and Veronica go to a frat party because they get a note from the rapist saying he'll pick his next victim at the party. Veronica thinks she found the next victim, goes to her dorm room and waits for the rapist --it's Mercer. He and the R.A., moe (the one with keys to all of the rooms and who drives the booze cruiser) was helping him. They drug Veronica, but Parker saves her. Keith bursts in with a gun and takes the two to jail. Later we see Logan taking a baseball bat to a cop car windshield. ""why is he doing that?"" I think. The next shot is of Logan in being ushered into the jail cell with Mercer and Moe!!!\n\nMeanwhile Keith has been hired by Dean O'Dell to find out if his wife is cheating (we already know she has, with Prof. Landry). When Keith discovers this he tells O'Dell, who goes to the hotel room where the lovers are meeting with a gun. We don't see what happens in the room. Later that night, Dean O'Dell is in his office, when someone he knows, but we don't see, walks in. The next morning Weevil finds the dean dead, laying over his desk.\n\nCatch this one on rerun if you can. I've been a fan of this show for three years, but this was their best hour of television so far! Hope I helped!"

"I think it all depends on the movie. In ""Labyrinth"" she was good, but, she was still young so she didn't have the experiance she does now. She also still had some baby fat and some curves. In ""Requiem for a Dream"" she was amazing especially since that movie wasn't an easy one to act for. ""Hulk"" and the horror one she did (I think it was ""Dark Water"") don't really showcase any of her skill but, she looked good in them although it looked like she was losing weight. I think she looked better body-wise when she was younger (I don't think sticks are attractive) but, facially she looks better now."

Well,  you can clean the house and take care of the baby while I lay around and watch tv, take a hot bath, maybe read a while, take a nap....then you can make dinner, help the big kids with their homework, fold the laundry that's been in the dryer for 2 days now, make sure everyone brushes their teeth and gets to bed on time and then you're free to go.  Don't complain, at least you get to go!  Are you in?

"The Wikipedia entry for this channel is pretty interesting:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Games_and_Sports_for_Kids\n\nWhen I've watched Nick Gas with my kids, I've noticed that most of the shows are somewhat dated...although still fun.

Lyrics to Keisha White I Choose Life\n\nUsed to be easy, \nUsed to have truth hangin’ round, \nNever had secrets, \nAlways singin’ your praises good and loud, \n\n(The relationship started out good, honest, and she was proud to have him)\n\nAll I got is questions, \nAnd you left me wondering why, \nWhy you keep your distance, \nEvery lonely night, \n\n(He doesn't come home every night and she wonders what it is he is doing because he doesn't tell her)\n\nWhen love was bound together, \nBelieved it by the letter, \nIt closed my eyes for ever, \nCause  everything has changed and now… \n\n(They used to be tight and she closed her eyes to anything that might be wrong)\n\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \nAfter all the clouds go by, \nIt’s just another empty sky, \nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \nNothing’s gonna make it right, \nLook at me cause I choose life, \n\n(She isn't going to let him get away with his crap, she isn't going to wait for it to get better, she is going to move on)\n\nIt’s all about giving, \nIt’s not about winning the game, \nMy mind was opened, \nReady or not you closed it up again, \nStill I keep asking, \nIf you’ve got something to hide, \nI never stopped learning, all the reasons why, \n\n(In a relationship you have to give yourself, she gave herself and he didn't and he hurt her so she closed up inside. She thinks he is hiding something because she learned he has in the past)\n\nIt took about a minute, \nTo find the point and hit it, \nGotta take this life and live it, \nCause everything has changed and now… \n\n(It didnt take her long to find the problem and fix it because life is short and you have to live it)\n\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \nAfter all the clouds go by, \nIt’s just another empty sky, \nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \nNothing’s gonna make it right, \nLook at me cause I choose life, \n\nWhen all the lights go out, \nSo suddenly, I lose my way, \nSo baby tell me, is something goin on, \nYou gotta free me, this time I’m gonna be strong, \n\n(She feels clueless when he doesn't tell her whats going on. It makes her believe he is doing something wrong and she wants him to break it off because she isn't strong enough to do it herself)\n\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \nAfter all the clouds go by, \nIt’s just another empty sky, \nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \nNothing’s gonna make it right, \nLook at me cause I choose life, \n\nI ain’t gonna look the other way, \nAfter all the clouds go by, \nIt’s just another empty sky, \nI ain’t gonna wait to see the rain, \nNothing’s gonna make it right, \nLook at me cause I choose life,

I am 53 and I went through the drug scene growing up and to be honest with you I enjoy being sober.  Life is so grand that you don't need the artificial highs to enjoy it.  I get high when I see my children and my grandchildren.  I catch a buzz when I read my Bible and go to church.  I get happy when I am just with my wife watching television or talking to one another.  There is life after drugs and alcohol.  I regret the times that I have missed by being high, I will never get those years back, but I do not dwell on it and just go forward.
LOLOLOL now that is my kind of question!  Good one!  Most def agreed!  LOLOLOL

He must be having a metal breakdown or something.  I've never seen his stand up, but I would imagine if he's done it before then he would have some snappy comebacks for hecklers.  There's no excuse for what he said.  You make fun of how hecklers look maybe, but not outright racially attack someone with malice.

My best suggestion would be talk to your music teacher about it. They tend to know everything you need to know. Also do have any really nice reputable music stores around?

Heath Ledger is another one of those wonderfully talented blokes that make me sick (j/k).  Any role he takes he makes his own.

"hey bud-\n\nthis is impossible but...\n\n""Achilles Last Stand"" is the best song of Led Zeppelin.\n\nThe song is one of the longest Zeppelin songs, at 10 minutes and 25 seconds. The song is famous for John Bonham's immensely powerful drumming, John Paul Jones's galloping bass line (played on a custom made eight string bass), Jimmy Page's overdubbed orchestral guitar arrangement (incredibly the dozen or so guitar tracks on this song were recorded in one session), and a dramatic, epic guitar solo which is considered by many to be among Page's best.\n\nPage has been quoted saying that it is his favorite Led Zeppelin song, so that should go a long way\n\ni guess my personal favorite is No Quarter or How Many More Times"

At first I thought so, but now I wonder.  Anyone who agrees to do a lie detector test would have to be innocent in my opinion.  I know a lot of lawyers tell you never take one, because they are so inconclusive and some people get so nervous, every question is screwed up and can make you look guilty.  \n\nWhen the camera is on him sometimes he looks guilty.

I agree! Hilary Duff is multitalented! She can sing, act, and even design her own line of clothing and accessories for girls. She even announced that she wants to stay a virgin until married--what a great role model for girls! Her music is light-hearted, fun, has good messages and morals, and she even portrays easy to relate to characters that match well with how young adults are feeling! She is definitelty a gal on the right path and hopefully she will remain so for years to come! Rock on Hilary!!!!

Good question. There's so many of them so it's hard to pinpoint, so I'll go at random at the top of my head.\n\n1. Boyz in the Hood- probably the most amazing film from the 90's I've had the pleasure to see at a special screening.\n2. Pulp Fiction for obvious reasons.\n3. Dead Again- great noir with Andy Garcia.\n4. Good Will Hunting\n5. La Femme Nikita

There are only two things that make anything manufactured of high quality or low quality.\n      First is the material used. Top quality material will make a better product than low quality. Next is the workmanship that goes into its manufacture.\n      Price, which usually has little to do with quality is determined by the pricing policy of the manufacturer and the amount of advertising that goes into its selling.\n      A well known brand name is no guarantee of quality. It is a guarantee that the company has poured gobs of money into making itself known.\n      Learn to judge material. Know what is best , and why it is best. Examine the workmanship, and learn the best from pretty good, from passable, or poor.\n      If you buy by label, you're not necessarily getting your money's worth.

"You two have to find your 'own' song.  Just listen to music together and when you hear the right one, something will 'click'. My husband and I have ""Wonderful Tonight"" by Eric Clapton. I know it's an old song and might not be considered rock, but the lyrics just hit home with us both.  It ended up being our 'wedding' song.   Good Luck in your search. There are so many great rock songs out there, new and old."

Off the top of my head, I can name the following shows that were on Cartoon Network between 1996 (when I started watching) and now:\n\nSpeed Racer, Dragonball Z, Sailor Moon, Robotech (a.k.a. Macross), Gigantor, Pokemon, Digimon, Zatch Bell, Naruto, One Piece, Cowboy BeBop, Outlaw Star, Voltron, Transformers, Trinity Blood, Bleach, InuYasha, FullMetal Alchemist, Dragonball, Dragonball GT, Crayon Shin-Chan, Super Milk Chan, Case Closed (better known as Detective Conan), Gundam (several different series), Candidate for Goddess, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, several Studio Ghibli movies (Princess Mononoke, Porco Rosso [I think], Spirited Away), Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo, Thundercats (which may not count because it was made in Japan for the American market), Big O, FLCL, Lupin III, Paranoia Agent, S-Cry-Ed, Eureka Seven, possibly Escaflowne, .hack//, Read or Die, Zoids, Samurai Champloo, Yu Yu Hakusho.  The list goes on and on (trust me).\n\nThere have been other shows (I can't remember them all), but I do know that Toonami started out as mostly (if not all) anime and led off with (believe it or not) Sailor Moon for awhile.  There are lists on Wikipedia (see the first two links), but I don't think anyone separated out the anime from the rest of the cartoon shows.

I can think of two ways. Burn the podcast to cd then rip it as an mp3. Then use an audio editor to see the mp3 as a waveform and then find the relevant part and cut around it. Finally, extract the clip as an mp3 using the program you've used to edit it.\n\nAnother method is to record it direct from radio onto a pc as an mp3 then follow the same process.\n\nI've not heard their podcast but I loved their show from years back.

Seriously you want to get there between the hours of 12am to 2am.  Then when you get there you want to take an extra person with you to push a cart, cause there's gonna be a lot of people there.  This way someone can watch your cart, you can run in grab the t.v. that you want and you have a cart to put it in.  That and carts clutter up areas.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Or have an other person who may be a little bit more aggressive go in and grab the t.v.

Sorry for having copied/pasted twice ( by mistake) but I sure think it needs to be reminded LOL :-))!\n\n\nThanksgiving, or Thanksgiving Day, is an annual one-day holiday to give thanks (traditionally to God), for the things one has at the close of the harvest season. In the United States, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, and in Canada it is celebrated on the second Monday in October. In the United Kingdom, Thanksgiving is another name for the Harvest festival, held in churches across the country on a relevant Sunday to mark the end of the local harvest, though it is not thought of as a major event (compared to Christmas or Easter) as it is in North America, where this tradition taken by early settlers became much more important. Other European countries, such as Germany, also have harvest-thanks (Erntedank) celebrations which are perceived to be rather minor and mostly rural holidays.\n\nThanksgiving in the United States\nThe first official Thanksgiving was held in the Virginia Colony on December 4, 1619 near the current site of Berkeley Plantation, where celebrations are still held each year in November.[2]\n\n\nPilgrims\nThe Pilgrims were particularly thankful to Squanto, the Indian who taught them how to catch eel, grow corn and who served as an interpreter for them (Squanto had learned English on a previous trip to Europe). Without Squanto's help the Pilgrims might not have survived in the new world. The Pilgrims set apart a day to celebrate at Plymouth immediately after their first harvest, in 1621. At the time, this was not regarded as a Thanksgiving observance; harvest festivals were existing parts of English and Wampanoag tradition alike. Several American colonists have personal accounts of the 1621 feast in Massachusetts:\n\nThanksgiving in the United States\nThe first official Thanksgiving was held in the Virginia Colony on December 4, 1619 near the current site of Berkeley Plantation, where celebrations are still held each year in November.[2]\n\n\nPilgrims\nThe Pilgrims were particularly thankful to Squanto, the Indian who taught them how to catch eel, grow corn and who served as an interpreter for them (Squanto had learned English on a previous trip to Europe).

it sounds like it is from someone that is in love with the person they are writing it too yet that person really does not care for the writer and the writer is becoming a bit like a stalker yet they do not wish to be this. they have hopes the person will change there mind and care for them yet there hopes are always shattered again and again the simple stories are like there pleas to understand why they should be together but they were unnecessary because the person did not even read them and it had on effect on them.

"Semperfi....it's a marine thang.....The United States Marine Corps\n \nUnited States Marine Corps EmblemThe United States Marine Corps motto, since 1883, is ""Semper Fidelis"". There were three mottos prior to Semper Fidelis, including ""Fortitudine"" (meaning ""with courage"") antedating the War of 1812, which was a nod to the British Royal Marines' ""Per Mare, Per Terram"", and up until 1843 there was also the motto ""To the Shores of Tripoli."" The motto signifies the dedication that individual Marines are expected to have loyalty to ""Corps and Country"" and to their fellow fighting men and women, for the rest of their days and beyond. Marines often reduce the phrase to ""Semper Fi.""\n\n""Semper Fidelis"" is also the title of the official march of the United States Marine Corps, composed by John Philip Sousa in 1889. Sousa was director of the United States Marine Band (""The President's Own"") when a replacement for Hail to the Chief was requested, but later rejected. Sousa considered it to be his ""most musical"" march. It was prominently featured in the movie A Few Good Men. Lyrics to the march were written by Charles Burr and can be found on Wikisource. \nOn every eagle, globe and anchor in the Marine Corps, the eagle holds a ribbon emblazoned ""Semper Fidelis"

Oh, and the second time, he wasn't allowed to bail, because he had violated his bail conditions from the previous OUI. Eeeeeboy.

"OVERVIEW for 2007: \nPisces is having a once in a lifetime opportunity for great changes this year. You will be having the time of your life, expressing your loving and compassion to the world and fulfilling your boldest dreams. There won't be a dull moment and you will intuitively know exactly what path to follow and what feels right in your heart. You will feel compelled to grasp new opportunities that manifest self-transformation in your career. You're stepping into your power easily, especially around April when you are urged to express your visionary mentality. You might rediscover your musical abilities and express yourself in creative ways. You have the power and inspiration to bring mystical sensitivity to what's around you. It's time to bring out the dreamy, loving and compassionate side of yourself and let it shine. You may want to get involved in writing, be it lyrics, poetry or just self reflection. Your idealistic nature is inspired from a strong connection to your surroundings, and you easily express yourself from a place of inner awareness. Your natural ability to communicate ideas to others is keenly perceptive now. Focus on trusting your intuition and you will get through nearly any circumstance. You need to lighten up about difficulties in life. Don't be so critical and overly concerned about details. Because you're so sensitive to others' moods, you may feel like you're not coming across in a very positive way. Take time out and have fun this year. Embrace that intimate love relationship you have!\n\nSample Numerology reading \nMarch 10, 1980\n\nThis Year: 3\nSelf-expression and optimism fill your moments now. The waiting period is over and it's time to jump up and get on with things. Luck is on your side, and you seem to shine with sunny warmth and enthusiasm which draws well-wishers, (and potential benefactors), to you from near and far. Creative pursuits, travel, and communication of every kind is emphasized now. This time can bring an actual ""birth"", or a figurative one in the form of a new business or career, a work of art or even a new self-image. The important thing is that you use this time of opportunity to the best of your advantage and find new ways to express who you are.\n\nPersonal Day: 3\nSing, dance, make people laugh! Wear yellow or orange. Today you radiate and warm like the sun. Smile and bless us all!\n\nLife Path or Destiny: 22\nThe Destiny number describes the life lessons that we have come here to learn. It reveals to us the path we must take, and the role we must play to fulfill our mission. Often our choice of career is based on this vibration, and if not, then it will manifest through avocational pursuits. We may attract people and experiences into our lives that mirror the traits of this number for us, so that we may develop into our highest potential. We don't always welcome our life lessons, so it is a possibility that we may even feel an aversion to the characteristics of our Destiny number in other people, and we may ourselves act the opposite. In spite of the many ways we may choose to react to this force within us, we have been gifted with all of the talents and energy needed to fulfill our Destiny. This ""master number"" requires the bearer to dedicate their life to philanthropic aims and service on a world-wide scale. Your destiny gives you the potential to accrue vast wealth, power and greatness through inspired and constructive reformation of social standards. No matter what form your fortune takes, it will be important that it benefits large groups of people in some way. Number 22 is a higher octave of the number 4 and may be experienced as such, or fluctuate during your lifetime.\n\nCycles\nThe destiny is divided into 3 great cycles, each governing us for specific durations throughout our life. The Seed cycle begins at birth and colors our experiences through childhood and adolescence. During the year nearest our"

The best movie I have seen in a long time.  What an amazing writer.

I actually camped out with them last night. I met them at golden sands camp site in wales. They were sharing a volkswagon camper van and a 4 lion tent.

Shared some good anecdotes and more than a few tiger beers though.
1. Yes, but it takes more than a couple people to piss me off. It just sort of builds up until I explode. What bothers me the most is people pulling out in front of me ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE BEHIND ME AND THEY COULD HAVE WAITED THE EXTRA TWO SECONDS and what makes that worse is getting in front of me and then going SLOWER. And rubberneckers. This past week I went TWO miles in a matter of an hour, only to find out it was because EVERYONE slowed down to look at a fender bender of Interstate 95. Ridiculous....\n\n2. I live in Florida now so snow is a thing of the past, but it does rain everyday here and ... you would think that people in Florida would be used to driving in the rain, but nope. They're ridiculous. Half of them going half the speed limit and the other half going double trying to get out of the rain. \n\n3. Yelling. Flicking people off. Which I have to pick and choose where I do the second one because there have been quite a few fights and murders due to road rage in Miami.

Well, it's all about this kid and his family, and I guess the main story is how Ralphie (that's the kid) wants a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas, but it looks like he's not going to get one because even Santa said he'd shoot his eye out. All kinds of fun various things happen during the story, just to add life to the thing, and then come Christmas he gets the gun. But then he accidently shoots his head, breaks his glasses. And he beats up a bully.\nSorry I'm not very coherent. Go to imdb.com, you might get a better synopsis.

Good question. Yes they probally want to attempt to make their own anime by just pure inspiration. But why stop them? Let them at least try. And maybe at one point, it'll be just a phase and they just want to give up on it. Maybe theres a chance that they wont be good enough no matter the teachings that have been given to them. And maybe they might succeed. But either way, they are doing it. Even though i find it abit dumb myself. I cant find them dumb for being an anime fan.

This is your luck day, I studied mostly medieval history in college. Well, the movie is a great one, one of my favorites, but alas no. The battle of Sterling Bridge in 1297 had a bridge. The English were bottlenecked and the Scots were able to exploit this and kill many crossing the bridge but many English just drowned as they had on a decent amount of equipment and most people then didn't swim. I don't know the whole story in detail, but Robert the Bruce got a bad wrap in the movie, he is a national hero in Scotland. Also, Wallace was not some landed peasant, he was a Knight and was reasonable educated.

There's no real reason for it, but as an Aquarius I've never found a Sagittariius man who I'd want to spend much time with. They seem to adapt some of the characteristics of the centaur that represents them. Macho to an extreme. If they're really smart, they can be interesting, but tend toward infidelity. \n\nEccentric, open-minded Aquarius may find a Sag too traditional in philosophy as well. Let me also say, I don't recall any Sag falling for me either. I don't think they like independent women.\n\nHowever, there may other things in your horoscopes which soften and undo many of negatives I've mentioned. And since they are 60 degrees apart in zodiac, that is supposed to bode for a good relationship.

I think in moderation it is ok. If a couple wants to watch it together once in a while just to be kinky, that's ok. However excessive viewing of porn distorts a persons way of thinking about sexuality.Everything and anything becomes about sex.Porn can be addictive, like a drug. It can also fuel urges in people who are already predisposed to sex-offender ways of thinking. I think porn should be off limits to sexual predators.

"Heckling is expected in stand up.  This is motivation for comedians to improve their act and get some laughs with a snappy comeback.  Richards was acting like a baby who can't take any criticism and he threw a tantrum and his true colors came out.  He clearly looks like someone who'd never done this before.  Whatever his issues were, he should have reacted to the expected heckling like a normal person; rather than personally attack someone based on race.  There are many racists in Hollywood (don't be fooled by the ""liberal"" branding).  A black woman working behind the scenes on ""Friends"" made a claim that the writers would constantly make racist, anti-black comments and sexist comments regarding the actresses on the show.  This is the REAL Hollywood you don't hear much about until incidences like this."

You won't like my answer...I think it is a ploy to get paid.  If he gets custody, she'll have to pay celebrity child support.  He probably thinks the publicity will help his failing Rap career.
"jesus was obviously an inspiration.. ""get off your f'in cross, we need the f'in space to put the next fool up.""  i guess it's kind of a hate song towards martyrs."
I'm willing to bet that you're overjoyed because you've had a personal revelation....I had one of those this past weekend. If I'm mistaken....well, you asked me to guess! :)

But here's what I have:\n\nI Want My Mommy (Time for Bed)\n\nTick, tock goes the clock but I am all right (X4)\n\nIt’s 8:30 and it’s time for bed\nI’ve got my PJs on and I’m hanging on to teddy bear\nI’m in my sheets now and I’m tucked up tight\nNo there’s not much I can see at night (X2)\n\nI want my mommy\nI need my daddy\nBut I’m stuck here in my bed at night\nCause I’ve got my pillow\nAnd I’ve got my blanket\nAnd I know that everything is gonna be all right?\n\nIt’s 2:30 and I’m wide awake\nI heard some thunder clap and it made my windows shake\nI hear some howling and I’m not quite right\nScary noises giving me a fright (X2)\n\nI want my mommy\nI need my daddy\nBut I’m stuck here in my bed at night\nCause I’ve got my pillow\nAnd I’ve got my blanket\nAnd I know that everything’s gonna be all right?\n\nTick tock goes the clock but I’m all right\nMom and dad put me in my bed tonight\nGot my teddy bear at my side\nI pat his head and I check my night light\n\nIt’s 7:30 and I just woke up\nI slept all night like a real grown up\nI made it through the night and now I feel good\nJust like my Mom and Dad said I would (X2)\n\nI love my mommy\nI love my daddy\nBut I’m happy in my bed at night\nCause I’ve got my pillow\nAnd I’ve got my blanket\nAnd I know that everything’s gonna be all right!

Shriekback songs never make sense. ;)\n\nHaha, I love the track, but I think the lyrics are not meant to have any meaning outside of its simplistic folk story feel.
John Michael Montgomery - Till Nothin' Comes Between Us\n\nClose your eyes, can you see me?\nRollin' down the Rocky mountains,\nmoving like the wind that sweeps the Kansas plains.\nI know you're with me\nas I make my way thru Oklahoma,\npast the barns and weathervanes.\nThere are motels, cafes, fields and billboard signs,\na thousand miles of highway between your heart and mine.\n\nThere will finally come a moment\nwhen one man and one woman\nget everything they've be waiting for.\nI'll take you in my arms again,\nfeel your skin against my skin,\nlet the sheet fall slowly to the floor\ntil nothing comes between us anymore.\n\nIn my soul,\nI can feel you\nas I cross the Mississippi\nyou're the river flowing in me.\nComing home,\nI count each heartbeat\ntil the moment we're together\nand the distance can be measured.\nThat's all that keeps me going when I'm gone.\n\nThere will finally come a moment\nwhen one man and one woman\nget everything they've been waiting for.\nI'll take you in my arms again,\nfeel your skin against my skin,\nlet the sheet fall slowly to the floor,\ntil nothing comes between us anymore.

Definately not with Mrs Margaret Thatcher. She probably grill me to death.
well thats a confusing question you got there, if daniel radcliffe loves emma watson are you asking if he did before or if he currently loves emma watson...oh and i think i know what you are saying but i am going to have to go with a no just because i think that they are god what 16 17? I doubt they know what love is number 1 and number 2 they would not jeopardize the movie like that, sure if it lasts its all good, but if they break up or something the production is screwed they are going to have to find a new bloody harry potter and/or a new frkcn hermione now how pissed off would harry potter fans be then huh huh?

If you are referrinjg to the Mel Gibson film about the revolutionary war and not the Steven Segal film, the patriots swere the Americans who fought for the colonies and the loyalists were american citizens who remained on the side of the king.  It has been awhile since I saw the film, but I do not recall anyone swtiching sides after their minds were made up, unlike the real war when you had such as Benedict Arnold.  This is basic history.

World's greatest karaoke singer.  All hype.  Didn't write his own songs.  Not even as good as other guys from his time and place.  Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis,  and what about Chuck Berry so much more talent, they just didn't have Elvis's looks or hype machine.

The Times Of Your Life - Paul Anka
The reason Fallon couldn't adopt her is he hadn't the means financially to take care of her as he was just a squire (of sorts) for Borden. Cadlow was a Lord, with obvious means to raise the child to be something other than a pauper, which Fallon clearly was. Had Fallon come forward as the twin, the secret of the trick would have been revealed and the ultimate revenge that Borden wanted to exact wouldn't have been attainable. The impact of the ending would then have been lost.
there's always been rumors about them being broke up. i think they are still together.

"You DO know that Sears is owned by KMart, right?  Of course!  They're exploiting a natural market niche-- the down-home, blue-collar, lower middle class.  You know, the same folks who buy their kids' clothes at Wal-Mart, like to visit Disneyland (if they can afford it), and take their kids to McDonalds for a sundae as a treat.  Nothing unethical about it, just doesn't sit right with ""thinking folk"" who can't stand the show to begin with... Welcome to the post-modern era..."
Good luck in cleaning it up!!!  I have a dirty mind.  hahaha....  Enjoy at will.
Yeah,I really don't care all that much.

"""A New Hope."" Obi Wan (old Ben) says it."
It freakin SUCKS! I would rather eat my own vomit.
Because he's human and its seperate issues. If he does something that needs ridicule doesn't make him any less 'honourable'. Like I said he's human.
Locke by far. He has an awesome personality and outlook. Paolo and Nikki suck hard....
I was listening to Hardattack on Sirius the other day and they played some early Lamb of God (they were called Burn The Priest back then). That stuff was the heaviest stuff I have ever heard. I can't remember any of the titles but I am sure it had something to do with ripping heads off and spitting down the stump. Gwar are also pretty insane.
"I always say that to my friend! By the women saying that they are 150% sure that he is the father instead of saying 100% sure should tell you right away that they don't have it all upstairs! I really can't stand when they go up to the picture and say "" look at the eyes, look at the lips he/she looks just like him! I watch it because I love after they say all that and when  Maury says ""you are not the father"" just to see them look stupid and run to the back! I am a woman and think the whole thing is hilarious! Remember Andrew?"

"It hasn't happened yet. The anime at this point is still continuing on fillers.. Once KG and Part II start, you can safely assume that Gaara is presently the Kazekage. There isn't an episode/chapter where he ""becomes"" Kazekage. Naruto is told that while he was away, Gaara became a Kage."
No! Don't say its dead!\nbecause as soon as we say its dead it becomes retro.\nretro and cool.\nand it will come back to haunt us with delightful dance moves and high pitched voices.  \nlet it live, small and pathetic in the gutter of pop culture. \ndo not call it dead, though.

Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  Funniest show ever!
Well it depends on the circumstance.I have a 14 year old,10 nearly 11 year old,and a 3 year old.When my daughters were younger,I would give them time out,or take away their favourite toy for a day or 2,and explain to them why I have done this. this is what I do with my son now too.Now that the girls are getting older,again depending on what they have done,I either,take away their phone privileges,computer privileges, t.v privileges,take their stereo out of their rooms,or if my eldest is late without a good explanation,I don't allow her to go to whatever her next outing is,whether it's a party,if if she had planned to stay at a friends house on the weekend.Thank god I haven't had to do these  very often,because I think from a very early age they have learn that there are always going to be consequences for their actions,whether the consequences are bad or good.I have never raised a hand to my children,not because I don't believe in it,I have never had a need to.I hope I was of some help.take care.

Ralph McTell -  Streets of London\n\nHave you seen the old man \nIn the closed-down market \nKicking up the paper, \nwith his worn out shoes? \nIn his eyes you see no pride \nAnd held loosely at his side \nYesterday's paper telling yesterday's news \n\nSo how can you tell me you're lonely, \nAnd say for you that the sun don't shine? \nLet me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London \nI'll show you something to make you change your mind \n\nHave you seen the old girl \nWho walks the streets of London \nDirt in her hair and her clothes in rags? \nShe's no time for talking, \nShe just keeps right on walking \nCarrying her home in two carrier bags. \n\nChorus\n\nIn the all night cafe\nAt a quarter past eleven, \nSame old man is sitting there on his own \nLooking at the world \nOver the rim of his tea-cup, \nEach tea last an hour \nThen he wanders home alone \n\nChorus\n\nAnd have you seen the old man \nOutside the seaman's mission \nMemory fading with \nThe medal ribbons that he wears. \nIn our winter city, \nThe rain cries a little pity \nFor one more forgotten hero \nAnd a world that doesn't care \n\nChorus

"I found this on the IMDB message board about this movie.\n\n""The character of the killer was inspired by the true story of the serial killer with possibly the record amount of killings, Pedro Alonso Lopez, ""El Monstruo de los Andes"" (monster of the Andes), who raped and murdered between 310 - 500 girls between Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. \n\nLopez, a Colombian, was once captured in Peru by the cops. The natives of a town approached him when he was suspiciously talking to a young girl. He was captured and tortured by the natives for several hours, and he was about to be burned alive when a protestant missionary saved him. The cops intervened at that point and arrested him, but they did not believe the reports of the natives, and deported him to Ecuador. \n\nThe discovery of a mass grave after a flood in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1980 quickly led to his arrest. A confession was extracted out of him by making a priest pretend that he was a fellow inmate and join him in his cell. In one day of talking Lopez calmly confessed to all his murders. He later led investigators to the gravesites of several of his victims (53 just in the first gravesite). He currently serves a life sentence in Ecuador. """

Hrithik Roshan as Aryan\n\nSupercop Jai Dixit (abhishekh )describes him as 'the perfect thief' who has left the entire police force baffled. He lurks in the shadows, he comes when least expected and leaves without a trace. No one has seen him. On paper, he does not exist. But he is the man behind the most daring and impossible heists. He is Aryan (Hrithik), or Mr. 'A'.\n\nAryan has a unique style of working. He trusts none. He seeks challenges. He loves stretching his own limitations. Impossible is nothing for him.\n\nHe is like a thief with the personality of a gentleman. He uses his brain more than his tongue. He is a quiet, thinking thief with very refined tastes in arts, wine and women.
I like both of them, they both CHARMING, but Hugh Grant is getting too wrenkly, so I would go for Clive Owen...he's sooooo sexy and handsome!

Landslide by the Dixie Chicks.\nMy partner and I had been together for five months and everything felt so great. I was at University in a town far away from my home town and he lived in the town my University was in, working in a warehouse. My mother wasn't in favour of our relationship even though I was nineteen at the time, and told me I had to come home for the Summer. At the time, I didn't want to make her mad- and my father was really abusive and would have hurt either me or one of my sisters who still lived at home.\nI announced I had to go home for the Summer. I wrote it in a letter because I couldn't bear to tell him. We were and are really inseperable. \nI went into the bathroom and burst into tears, as he read the letter. When I came back into the bedroom, he was sobbing on the bed and had put on a song he said reminded him of me. It was landslide by the Dixie Chicks. The lines 'I'm afarid of change because I've built my life around you', really moved me and he was inconsolable. \nI managed five days back in my home town before I realised I could have a new life away from the abuse and emotional blackmail. I think that song tripped a switch in my brain that told me to go back to the man I love.\nI can't listen to that song now, it reminds me of our struggle to be together and how we had to build everything from scratch- how when I returned to him I did not bring anything because if I took a suitcase my parents would surely have realised what I was doing and made it so I couldn't go anywhere. My partner bought me clothes, he worked extra hours, and later I found a job so we could have a life together.\nWe are getting married in Feb and that song will play at our wedding.\nSorry this was so long, I just felt like telling someone...

"This wasn't my fault, but it was I who got embarrassed....\nLast night my boyfriend's daughter locked the keys in the car by accident and it was the only set of keys. So we had to wait there until someone brought a metal hanger, and I had to crawl on top of the car and ""fish"" with the hanger through the sunroof (that wasn't completely open; it was open like 2-3 inches). Everyone in the gas station was laughing their butts off because of me crawling all over the top of the car and then once I got the keys, I almost fell off the car. So at least I gave everyone a good laugh!♥"

Yes, he keeps chickens. I believe he has a large c0ck..
"Computer Diagnosis   \n \n  One day Bill complained to his friend that his elbow really hurt. His friend suggested that he go to a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. \n''Simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs $10."" Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks."" \n \nLater that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message: \n\n""Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better."""

America's youth have been falling victim to what they see on TV, as well as other negative media images (advertisements, video games) for the past 10-15 years.  But it's not just MTV and BET.  MTV stopped playing music back around 1990, and kids stopped watching it around 1995.  BET lost any quality programming when they were bought out by Viacom (who owns MTV) around 1996 or 1997, and black kids don't really watch BET.  The real problem is that PARENTS RELY ON THE TELEVISION TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEM!  Parents aren't spending any quality time teaching their kids any proper values, such as respect or manners.  Parents also aren't encouraging their childeren to either get up from the TV and go out and do things, or to pick up a book and read.  It's not the fault of television, or the schools, or the government.  If you are a parent, then these are YOUR damn kids, so the only person responsible for how they turn out is YOU.
"I think the media will use anything that sells. Unfortunately violence is one of those things that attracts a specific target audience. I can't say that there is a direct encouragement through the media, but over time, when someone indulges in something, consequently, their behavior models that which they have ""lost"" themselves in."

What kind of music do you like and what are the some of the other 12 songs you have on there? It would help to know some of the stuff you listen to so that we can give you suggestions. \n\nHere's some of the songs I like (It's a big mix of different styles except I don't listen to rap nor country so you'll have to figure that out on your own):\nNew Year's Day - U2\nBittersweet Symphony - Verve\nBoston - Augustana\nHurt - Christina Aguilera\nSexyback/ My Love - Justin Timberlake\nManeater - Nelly Furtado\nLondon Bridge - Fergie\nWhen You Were Young - Killers\nSOS - Rihanna\nMove Along - All American Rejects\nCrazy - Gnarls Barkley\nCollide - Howie Day\nHow to Save a Life/ Over My Head - The Fray\nChasing Cars/ Chocolate/ Run - Snow Patrol\nI Write Sins Not Tragedies - Panic!

You could probably try listening to the clips first before you buy the songs or download them and figure out which ones you like. I don't know where you can go to click and listen to the a whole song that you selected. You could also watch the music videos on youtube.com which will give you the whole song.

When I was younger at my Grandma and PaPa's house. They lived about 7 hours away from us. My Grandma would spend all day cooking and baking everything from scratch. My Aunt and Uncle would be there. We would sneak in the kitchen and we would try to get some of the crispy skin off the turkey and my Grandma would come rushing over hitting us in the rear end with her wooden spoon trying to get us out of the kitchen. It was always like a game we would play. She would fill up that small wooden table full of food. When they finally got too old to stay by themselves they finally came to live with us. It was never the same after that. I lost my Grandma 4 1/2 yrs ago and lost my Mom 1 year ago. Now Thankgiving has been a bit hard on me. I am trying to start traditions on my own. I will always have fond memories of my Grandma in her little red checkered apron, cooking over her old fashioned stove, and the air filling up with the most delicious smells in the world. My Grandma put the Spice of Love in everything she cooked and no one will ever cook as well as she did.

I'm not a kiddy.... but I am partial to a man in a black polo neck jumper.... which is why I'm not letting rip at you...as in your Avatar you are wearing one... although the red background is shite, so change that....

i personally think hulk and superman would be pretty even if hulk was very very mad other then superman would be faster and have some extra abilities.  But with a symbiote any of them not nessaraly the venom one althought.  The symbiote would increase hulks strenght and also make him not just mad but crazy and mad.  He would be unstopable.  I don't think anything short of galactus or some other super omnipitant being would be able to stop him.

Well the best way to find this answer is to watch the movie Selena.Yolanda Saldivar was the name of the lady who killed her and she was her fan club president and manager of Selena's boutique. She got shot walking to her motel room. She took allot of money form Selena and after Selena and her family found out she felt really guilty and therefore killed her. For mor info the links below will help.
You have mentioned some great artists... but in terms of a singer, songwriter, and producer, I think that Buddy Holly's death robbed music of such an incredible talent. I believe that the impact of his death changed rock and roll and the direction that it went in. From a social stand point I believe that the drug related deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin, were the end of the sixties... what ever peace, love, and hope there was in the 1960's died with them... and the government could point to these deaths to weaken the beliefs of the counter-culture. I do have to totally disagree with you though about Kurt Cobain... he had not even scratched the surface of his talent... He was surrounded by people who gave his art nothing... Nirvana would have broken up soon enough if he had stayed alive... Kurt had all of the talent... I think he would have evolved beyond the sonic noise of Nirvana and been some kind of a cross between Bob Dylan and Michael Stipe... we will never know. I have to think of John Bonham too... Led Zeppelin is still the God of Rock and the only reason they disbanded was because of his death... Zep would have weathered the storm of punk rock and who knows how much great rock they had in them... Robert Plant truly blossomed as a solo artist but as a group Zep is unrivaled.

"It's very simple. She cares more about partying than she does about her children. She can say whatever she likes--that they mean the world to her. That they are the most important thing in her life. That she would do anything for them. Anything that doesn't interfere with her partying, obviously. That's where she has drawn the line. Behaviour is more indicative of what one feels and believes  than what comes out of their mouths.\n\nLeaving kids with a trusted babysitter is sometimes necessary, but each instance carries some risk. And the more frequently you leave them in somebody else's hands, the greater the chance for something untoward to happen to them. \n\nOn second thought, in some people's cases, their kids may be safer in other people's care. This may be true for Spears. Either way, She's probably not on the short list for ""Mother of the Year""."

oh my god I was watching that with some friends a few months back. it was SO weird! we just turned if off after about 30 minutes! so disappointed cus they had a pretty good cast and it could have been so much better
You are missing the fact that Joely Richardson had family difficulties during taping so they had to come up with away to send her off with what was going on in the story at the time. So a storm comes into Florida and destroys much of the area. Shawn is dreaming most of what is going on in the episode because he has just told Julia that he cheated on her. He has just told her that he had a cleff palate as a boy. He has just operated on Connor's hand and is ready to move on to hand number two. He has alot on his mind. Connor, Marlo, Christian, Matt, Julia, Anne and his father. He is afraid that many of their choices will backfire.\nOne thing to notice is they wrote in nothing about Kimber or the baby. What they wrote about is Anne having issues with her Princess party, Matt following in his fathers' footsteps, Connor thinking like Shawn that he ruined his parents' marriage, and Julia still having a relationship with Marlo even after they broke up in the last episode. In short this one long nightmare in the midst of the storm. When the storm is over, however, they are talking about having to rebuild things and that takes times. They are talking allegoically about their relationship and about the city damage.  Julia flies off to New York with the children and Shawn stays behind to clean things up in Miami. Colin Redgrave, Joely's uncle was near death with cancer and her daughter had a serious leg injury. That meant she needed time off to take care of thing.

This is a holiday so probably tomorrow.  Love her!
very funny and at least he was honest.
I never seen this movies but I want my 2 points.
"It's called Christmas Wrapping! Spice Girls covered it  but original was by the Waitresses...\n\n""Bah, humbug!"" No, that's too strong \n'Cause it is my favorite holiday \nBut all this year's been a busy blur \nDon't think I have the energy \n\nTo add to my already mad rush \nJust 'cause it's 'tis the season. \nThe perfect gift for me would be \nCompletions and connections left from \n\nLast year, ski shop, \nEncounter, most interesting. \nHad his number but never the time \nMost of '81 passed along those lines. \n\nSo deck those halls, trim those trees \nRaise up cups of Christmas cheer, \nI just need to catch my breath, \nChristmas by myself this year. \n\nCalendar picture, frozen landscape, \nChilled this room for twenty-four days, \nEvergreens, sparkling snow \nGet this winter over with! \n\nFlashback to springtime, saw him again, \nWould've been good to go for lunch, \nCouldn't agree when we were both free, \nWe tried, we said we'd keep in touch. \n\nDidn't, of course, 'til summertime, \nOut to the beach to his boat could I join him? \nNo, this time it was me, \nSunburn in the third degree. \n\nNow the calendar's just one page \nAnd, of course, I am excited \nTonight's the night, but I've set my mind \nNot to do too much about it. \n\nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nBut I think I'll miss this one this year. \nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nBut I think I'll miss this one this year.\nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nBut I think I'll miss this one this year. \nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nBut I think I'll miss this one this year. \n\nHardly dashing through the snow\nCause I bundled up too tight\nLast minute have-to-do's\nA few cards a few calls\n'Cause it's r-s-v-p\nNo thanks, no party lights\nIt's Christmas Eve, gonna relax\nTurned down all of my invites.\n\nLast fall I had a night to myself, \nSame guy called, halloween party, \nWaited all night for him to show, \nThis time his car wouldn't go, \n\nForget it, it's cold, it's getting late, \nTrudge on home to celebrate \nIn a quiet way, unwind \nDoing Christmas right this time. \n\nA&P has its pride in me \nWith the world's smallest turkey \nAlready in the oven, nice and hot \nOh damn! Guess what I forgot? \n\nSo on with the boots, back out in the snow \nTo the only all-night grocery, \nWhen what to my wondering eyes should appear \nIn the line is that guy I've been chasing all year! \n\n""I'm spending this one alone,"" he said. \n""Need a break; this year's been crazy."" \nI said, ""Me too, but why are you? \nYou mean you forgot cranberries too?"" \n\nThen suddenly we laughed and laughed \nCaught on to what was happening \nThat Christmas magic's brought this tale \nTo a very happy ending! "" \n\nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nCouldn't miss this one this year! \nMerry Christmas! Merry Christmas! \nCouldn't miss this one this year!"

It was once pointed out to me in a marketing book that People magazine was an excellent place to spot emerging trends in consumers.  Celeb's tend to latch on first to what's new & fresh and other people soon follow.  I thought it was an interesting idea.

Yeah.\n\nAmerica is just jack hammering away, not noticing that bored expression on her face while they make the area all sore and inflamed.\n\nThe best remedy would be to just admit that it ain't happening and pull out.
I enjoy the program but do not believe I am watching real footage of a dinosaur.  It is very entertaining for children to learn about the prehistoric or jurassic age.

"Mrs. McCluskey has spread the word about Art, so when he shows up dressed as Santa Claus at the holiday block party the mothers won't let their children near him. \n\nLynette is on her cell phone, arranging a meeting with all the concerned mothers when Art's wheelchair-bound sister, Rebecca wheels herself over to tell Lynette that everyone's treating Art like a pariah because of her. She says she doesn't need this stress in her condition. Lynette is sorry but says she has her kids to think about. \n\nBut when Lynette goes to the meeting, she's alarmed to see they're making anti-pedophile signs for a protest outside Art's house. She tries to tell the women that they don't know anything for sure, but they won't listen to her. She and Tom watch the protest from their yard and Lynette says she knows it's all her fault. An ambulance arrives and they find out Rebecca has had a heart attack. As Art is leaving the house, a protester throws a rock that hits him in the head. Lynette tries to get the protesters to leave, but to no avail. \n\nLater that night, she finds Art packing and offers to help. She heard on the news that Rebecca died and she's feeling incredibly guilty. To her surprise, he thanks her. He says that because he had to look after Rebecca he always had to keep himself in check because he didn't want her to know the truth about him. But now that she's dead, he's free to do whatever he wants in a new town where no one knows him. Lynette backs away, horrified by what her actions set in motion. \n\nGabrielle and Vern want to dump a girl named Amy from their roster of beauty pageant contestants since she has no talent. But when Gabrielle lays eyes on her handsome father Bill, whose wife died a year ago, she offers to give Amy private tutoring instead. Amy sees Gabrielle flirting with her father and says she doesn't want her dating him. She already has a plan for Bill to marry her best friend Sheri's mother. Gabrielle seems to have met her match, but she turns Sheri, the most talented of their contestants, against Amy by saying she's planning on making them dance together in the show. With the girls' friendship over, she's free to move in on Bill. \n\nIan wants his parents to meet Susan and for her to make dinner for them. She confesses she's a horrible cook but he isn't satisfied until she promises to try to make them a nice roast. She asks Bree to help her out and she agrees, saying she's glad for the distraction since she just threw Orson out after finding out about his affair with the murdered Monique. She still believes Orson is innocent, but Susan is telling her that you have to face the facts, even if it's someone you love, when they see Mike being arrested. \n\nEdie visits Mike in jail to let him know she's dumping him. Susan is his next visitor. She tells him she knows he's innocent, even if he doesn't know that for sure himself. \n\nSusan arrives late for their weekly poker game and asks if Bree has told the police her suspicions about Orson yet. Bree cheerily informs here that her suspicions are gone now that Mike, who was previously convicted of a murder, has been arrested. The two women argue over who's more guilty, Mike or Orson, and an infuriated Susan heads for the door. She loudly slams the front door and only pretends to leave. She tiptoes back in and steals the key labeled ""Orson's office."" \n\nShe goes to the office and finds Orson there, watching a game and eating pizza. She's just starting her search when Bree arrives and she has to hide. Bree tells Orson she's there to take him back because Mike has been arrested for Monique's murder. But she says she still needs to know the whole truth from him. With Susan listening in, he confesses that he never loved Alma, but that his mother pushed them together and then Alma got pregnant, so he did the honorable thing and married her"

Obviouly Rose's.....since it was she who was telling the happening in the car.\n3. Yes.....Remember it was Rose only who was still survived and those who were there in the final scene, were her real admirer. Many critics (including those in the inner circle of director James Cameron) think it was not a dream....but 100+ years old Rose dies in that very night when she drops the diamond in sea. Try to visualize that shot before hers ascending the steps....she is shown on cot....in deep sleep....actually dead....then her soul goes towards Jack's where it rests eternally."

"You must understand that the Star Wars universe is set ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"". ""A long time ago"" has been estimated to be thousands of years ago, so it could not range between 2006-2897 ABY. If I could make an estimate, I think it would be 10,000-15,000 years After the Battle of Yavin."
"The term ""heavy metal"" can be a bit confusing because the meaning has changed over time and means different things to different people.\n\nOriginally, all metal up until about the mid 1980's was just called heavy metal. This included Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and some of the hard rock bands that influenced them like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nTo metalheads, heavy metal is a term that differentiates that certain type of metal from thrash metal, death metal, etc. Main characteristics of the heavy metal sub-genre are two-guitar harmonies, aggressive riffs, and powerful clean vocals with a lot of emphasis on the upper ranges. \n\nIt's really hard to classify the metal sub-genres because there is a lot of similarities and crossovers between the genres. You'd really have to listen to a lot of metal to truly understand all of the distinct characteristics of each one."
"It's called ""In Your Hands"" by Reuben Morgan"
marshall stacks are very overrated. they haven't done anything to make marshalls better in 40 years. the clean channel sounds dirty and the amps own distortion is muddy. \nthe SG standard is fun guitar to play. depending on your sound..........any fender tube amp will make it sound great. twin reverb is one of the best amps ever built. if you can afford one, get a mesa boogie. a one twelve combo is as loud as any four twelve stack. plus you'd be micking it up anyway on stage. mesa's are so versatile, you can achieve any sounds from them, whether you play country twang or black metal. they are perfect. but you can get that two twelve fender combo for under 800 used. whatever you do, don't buy a solid state amp. even those peavey trans tubes are garbage. i made the mistake of buying one years ago. stick with tubes. especially with those warm hums on the sg. the SG is so thin, you really don't get any resonation from the guitar's wood body. the sound you get is very dependent on your amp with that guitar. it's just strings to pickups to amp. alot of thicker body guitars get a thicker tone because they share some acoustic characteristics. SGs don't get that at all. but what you lose there, you win with the light body, great natural trem, (just shake the guitar around a little bit when you play). and kick butt sound.
i hope everything is alright...my shoulder are always open for business...though they do smell like balloons

The Bob commercials are not for Viagra, are they? I thought they were for some other form of medication. Did you know, if all the money, time & energy spent on trying to keep mens' d*%$s hard was to be spent on cancer or diabetes research & medicines, they probably could eliminate them?? All of the pills, potions, pumps, implants, etc - all of that stuff. Is any of it necessary? If an old fart can't get wood & finish the job, is that such a big loss? Men should just accept that it's a part of aging & let it go. But NO! we have to spend billions of dollars on penises & pleasure, while little children die from cancer & diabetes runs rampant. What's wrong with this picture? Sorry, didn't mean to rant & rave - it's just how I feel . . .

"Going into ""Saw 3"" I expected a drop off from ""Saw 2"" which was a solid followup to ""Saw"". Generally, two solid sequels is a rareity in the horror genre. Well in the case of ""Saw 3"", Whannell, Bousman, and Wan get together to create a rareity. While ""Saw 3"" doesn't hold the same excitement as ""Saw 2"" did (mostly due to a smaller cast), it has much better traps and a much more clever overall storyline. The best thing is this second sequel picks up right where ""Saw 2"" left off, as the police are scowering the city for Jigsaw's latest victims to try and hopefully save them and catch Jigsaw at the same time. But Jigsaw being as clever as he usually is, is hidden away in a secret location with Amanda watching over him as his condition worsens, and I mean worsens. Jigsaw is not in good shape in this film people. He's bedridden and can't even move and can barely speak. However, despite his near death situation...that hasn't stopped him from playing games with those who he believes have taken life for granted. But this time around, the games are much more devious and nastier, and the victims trapped within the games are in a lose lose situation. Unlike when Jigsaw games his victims, they are given a chance to win their freedom. But as the films first 2 victims find out, these new games are rigged specifically for the victim to die regardless of whether they get free or not. So the question early on becomes...has Jigsaw changed inside and revealed his true self as a murderer, or is something else going on? That's one of the films big reveals which I won't give away here. ""Saw 3"" has alot of great twists and like the first two films in the series, it juggles many different substories wrapped within the films main story which this time has a man named Jeff (Angus Macfayden) playing a game where he has to choose whether or not to save those involved in his son's accidental death. As Jeff is going through his game, A doctor named Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) has been brought to Jigsaw by Amanda as specifically requested by him, to keep him from dying. Dr. Denlon is apprehensive at first, especially because she doesn't have the necessary tools or medicines to perform the intricate procedure necessary to keep Jigsaw alive. But of course with Jigsaw being Jigsaw, he makes her an ""explosive"" offer she can't refuse. One of the other things to like about ""Saw 3"" is that while Bell as Jigsaw does play a major role in the pic, most of the film is carried along by Shawnee Smith as Amanda who becomes a much more interesting and intriguing character in the film. You've gotta love the way her character has been expanded in the series from a victim in the first ""Saw"" movie, to a trojan horse in the second film, and to a major player in the third film. Soomekh's character of Dr. Denlon being tossed into the mix also makes the chemistry and relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda change at many points in the film, as Amanda goes through alot of different emotions in the movie which ultimately dictate the fate of alot of the movies characters. Along the way we also find out the fates of two characters from past ""Saw"" movies and how Amanda fits into all of that as well. Macfayden also does an excellent job as Jeff who only has half of his story told in the beginning before he's kidnapped and tossed into Jigsaw's ultimate game. Jeff lost his son to a hit and run driver which is told to us early on, but there's much more to his story which we learn at the very end and believe me it's a shocker. Jigsaw through a series of games, gives Jeff the opportunity to take revenge upon the three people involved in his son's demise. A woman who refused to testify to witnessing the accident, the judge who sentenced the driver leniently to just 6 months in prison, and the driver himself. J"

Steve Perry was not the original lead singer\n\nDuring its initial 14 years of existence (1973-1987), Journey altered its musical approach and its personnel extensively while becoming a top touring and recording band. The only constant factor was guitarist Neal Schon (b. Feb. 27, 1954), a music prodigy who had been a member of Santana in 1971-1972. The original unit, which was named in a contest on KSAN-FM in San Francisco, featured Schon, bassist Ross Valory, drummer Prairie Prince (replaced by Aynsley Dunbar), and guitarist George Tickner (who left after the first album). Another former Santana member, keyboard player and singer Gregg Rolie, joined shortly afterwards. \n\nhttp://www.steve-perry.com/\nwww.steveperryfanclub.homestead.com

I don't know why? I always let it drag me down, but can I leave it all behind?\n\nShe only likes me when I'm high\nShe's always trying to get me stoned\nShe wants to see me in her sky\nShe has to have me there alone\nShe's got me on my knees, begging baby, baby please! \nDon't hurt me, no, don't hurt me so\n\n\nShe's tracking, she tracks me down, she's bound to drag me down.

"I think that the original music video shows a 10 year old kid at ""Stacey's"" house, and every time Stacey isn't looking, he stares at her mom. Then she starts dancing provocatively or something, and then it ends. It was sooooo funny. I fell out of my chair laughing!"

WHOA!  Back up there slugger!  You're putting the cart before the horse.  So, you want to start a band?  And it's to be showcased at a talent show?\nFirst, decide what kind of sound you're looking for.  Who's going to be in charge and make all of the decisions?  And everyone's going to agree to follow?  Assuming you're in charge.  Pick out the music you're going to perform.  Have sheet music.  What kind of instruments are going to be needed to achieve that sound?  Advertise and hold auditions.  Remember, not all studio musicians make good stage performers and Visa Versa.  Hold the auditions, get names, phone numbers and demo tapes of everyone.  Listen to what each has to offer, write down your ideas.  Take the tapes and listen to them again.  Pare it down and begin making your call backs.  Get everyone together and see if there's a chemistry -- you'll know it if there is.  Begin rehearsing.  Practice individually and then together.  Record yourselves and play it back so everyone can hear what you sound like as a group.  Keep practicing.  Give it about a year to really get the act down, practicing in front of small audiences -- not your family and friends, you'll never get them to tell the truth.  And when at last you are ready, take it to the stage.  Be prepared for squabbles within the band and always have an ace in the hole.  Someone doesn't like the way things are going and wants to do it their way, have a back up.  Do you have all of the equipment?  Is each individual going to be expected to buy and supply their own or are you planning on renting?  Starting a band isn't really so easy, but if you are determined and everyone is willing to commit, it can be done.  Be realistic.  Eventually, it will be fun.
is that the song that goes my heart goes boom boom boom?  if it is, it is called solsbury hill by peter gabriel
funny
Emotional is far worse. Only someone who knows you very well can manage to do this, for they know the buttons to push. For example, if you'e a nice person who doesn't want to hurt other people's feelings, they can appeal to that side to get your compliance, i.e. by begging please, saying it won't take long, who else can help them, etc.  It's worse if your heart is involved because you will want to please them even though they make you unhappy. I equate emotional blackmail with manipulation, conniving, deceit by insecure control freaks. They will not be honest with themselves or others, and they can make life a literal h*ll. They will wear you out completely. I avoid these types of personalities at all costs, no matter how sweet or charming they may seem, because it's all a facade. They try to take advantage of your goodness for their own emotional needs without caring for you truly as a person and certainly they don't respect you.

I'm not a coffee drinker, so when I get really tired at work I usually drink some ice water, or get up and walk around. My office building is huge, so there's lots of places to wander around. That helps me wake up a little and I get some exercise in the process.
What exactly are you interested in knowing? \n\nI work for a magazine publishing company. We have about fourteen magazines and growing!!! \n\nIn a nutshell, you have the editorial dept who write the stories, the ad sales dept who sell ads which go in the magazines, and the art dept who lay out the whole issue in Quark or Indesign computer program.There are many people involved in producing the final product (magazine) which you see in the bookstores and newsstands.

They are such a kickbutt band.
I'm a huge fan too, and i do believe that what they get on tape is real, it interesting to point out that even Yevette who has been working on this show for years is not a fully converted believer. Derek's episodes of being possessed became more frequent and more OTT, his part was never what interested me i enjoy the orbs, noises and moving objects (like the drum on a table turning and sliding to the side at the same time .. That made me jump) The new mediums seem OK and not as 'show off' as Derek was. I still love the show no matter anyone else says.. it's a huge hit .

"OK, best as I can figure it out, there's this doctor working on trying to find a cure for his wife's tumor. She writes a book (except for the ending) about the Queen of Spain, a Conquistador and the Tree of Life. The doctor's unconscious (or ""higher self"") becomes obsessed with the idea of renewal, rebirth, etc. so he's fantasizing (dreaming) about being in a bubble and heading towards the nebula that's supposed to bring renewal and rebirth, thinking if he can save the tree of life (which has hairs on it like his wife Izzie has on her neck) then he can save Izzie.\n\nHe fails in saving Izzie and regrets not having gone with her to walk in the snow when she invited him so he imagines that he did walk with her and that he visits her grve and plants an acorn which will grow out of her just as the tree of life grew out of 1st father.\n\nI don't think we were actually supposed to understand it but just sit back and enjoy the cinematography!"
"In my opinion, we don't take is seriously enough!  I mean, why have the critics never noticed it is merely a scenery change - the stories are still the same genres they always are in fiction:\n\nComedy\nSoap\nHorror\nAction/Adventure\nThriller\nRomance\n\nHistorical and Sci-Fi are just two flip sides of the same coin.  Do you want to set your story in the past, present or future, or alternate reality (fantasy)?  Simple!\n\nBy that argument, there is absolutely no reason why comedy should not work within a Sci-Fi setting - it works in the Fantasy, I mean, some episodes of Buffy had me laughing out loud!  The strength is in the writing, and the writing behind Red Dwarf was spot on.\n\nIf you want a comedy with the same epic strength as the films you mention though, you have a problem - look at normal comedy films.  There is not the visual impact in a comedy that you have in an action/adventure - the emphasis is on the script.  Therefore, comedies will never ""appear"" epic in nature, it's a problem with the comedy genre, and not with sci-fi in particular."

I'm not really a fan of U2. Personally I think they aren't as good as their fans seem to think they are. The only reason why they are so popular is because Bono does a lot of things to better the world. Good gesture but I agree, bad singer!

Concerts. Music is the best thing life gives us. When I listen to music i can laugh, cry, reflect, forget my problems...there are just so many emotions that go through people when they listen to music. its incredible to be in a room full of people all feeling different emotions, listening to the same exact music and all being able to connect on a deeper, unspoken level.
"The song ""You"" is not an Evanescence song; it's a private Amy Lee song that was never meant to be released.  I'm not going to give you the lyrics but you can find them pretty much anywhere.  I have heard the song because I accidentally downloaded it not knowing what it was, but truly loyal fans will delete the file when they come across it as the band has requested, which I have done.\n\nWhat I am going to tell you is that it's a pretty well-known fact that Ben and Amy were, at one point, engaged to be married.  They are no longer really even friends.  In my opinion, ""You"" is probably about this relationship - but it's equally none of anybody's business except Ben and Amy.\n\nI do not understand why ""You"" is such a fascination with fans (perhaps it's because it's ""forbidden""), but these are the facts and nobody has really disputed them or bothered to hide them."
"I thought this was kinda interesting-someone posted it on songfacts:\n""Mr. Brightside is an old English story about Tim Brightside, who goes to America for a while. He meets a prostitute. They fall in love. The prostitute promises him she will quit her prostitution for her love to him. But one night, She doesn't come home. She is waiting outside a hotel for a carriage to arrive... with a client. She gets in and the man starts to remove her clothes on the way to where he lives. Word got around to our Brightside friend, and he becomes depressed. One day, he climbs to the top of the Brooklyn Bride and commits suicide. And that is the story of Mr. Brightside""\nNow! that kinda makes sense...anyway I'm going to see the killers on thursday! I CANT WAIT!!! :D"

Full marks to Channel 4! \n\nNoel is perfectly correct to boycott the show if celebs are brought into it, after all aren't they payed enough for their own shows and the money they ""win"", they could afford to give to charity without boring us all with how brilliant they are at opening boxes?!\n\nThese are just my views.

I guess some Americans know him, he has released albums and singles in America.  Some people say they find him to camp, to english, not American enough, some people say they find him to rubbish.  One way to gauge his sucesses and failures in yankie land is to take a look at his chart sucess. The American Chart Postions of Robbie Williams aren't great.  An international release only album 'The Ego Has Landed' which was supposed to be an introduction album to our American friends, which charted in the American Top 100 at 63 which was followed by the Album Sing When Your Winning, which didn't even make it into the top 100, managing to make it in at 110.  Whilst Escapology was his highest charting album at 43.  His singles have fared a little better with the god awful rudebox making the top twenty.  Angels made in in to 41 in the hot 100 whilst Feel made number 40.  Its not impressive but it could be worse, Many artists and bands from Britain struggle, unless they have some years behind them, or come from the 60s 70s & early 80s, such as the Rolling Stones,  Pink Floyd, and Duran Duran..... notable sucesses in recent time have been Radiohead, Dido, Spice Girls and Oasis.  Though the latter have found it hard to consildate their past sucess, though they still at least made the top 30 album charts with their last 3 album releases.  Though robbie isn't big in America the Northern part, he is huge in the Latin part he is one of the biggest International Acts in Latin America.

André-Philippe Gagnon;  (born 1962 in Quebec City, Quebec) is a Quebecois comedian and impressionist.\n\nHis impressionist act is unique for his specialized talent in impersonating the singing voices of celebrities as opposed to his contemporaries who typically can do only the speaking voices. He is best known for duplicating We Are the World.

In all probability it would be a B flat Clarinet, the most widely used instrument. If you have access to a piano or keyboard you can check by blowing a note on it without putting any fingers over the holes. If this note corresponds to an F on the keyboard then you have yourself a B flat clarinet.
"Most of the times we laugh at ""that"" funny thing,by thinking,\n""Thank God! That didn't happend with me....""\n\nWHY DO WE LAUGH?\nLaughter is part of the universal human vocabulary. All members of the human species understand it. Unlike English or French or Swahili, we don’t have to learn to speak it. We’re born with the capacity to laugh.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about laughter is that it occurs unconsciously. You don’t decide to do it. While we can consciously inhibit it, we don’t consciously produce laughter. That’s why it’s very hard to laugh on command or to fake laughter. (Don’t take my word for it: Ask a friend to laugh on the spot.)\n\nLaughter provides powerful, uncensored insights into our unconscious. It simply bubbles up from within us in certain situations.\n\nVery little is known about the specific brain mechanisms responsible for laughter. But we do know that laughter is triggered by many sensations and thoughts, and that it activates many parts of the body. \n\nWhen we laugh, we alter our facial expressions and make sounds. During exuberant laughter, the muscles of the arms, legs and trunk are involved. Laughter also requires modification in our pattern of breathing.\n\nWe also know that laughter is a message that we send to other people. We know this because we rarely laugh when we are alone (we laugh to ourselves even less than we talk to ourselves).\n\nLaughter is social and contagious. We laugh at the sound of laughter itself. That’s why the Tickle Me Elmo doll is such a success — it makes us laugh and smile.\n\nThe first laughter appears at about 3.5 to 4 months of age, long before we’re able to speak. Laughter, like crying, is a way for a preverbal infant to interact with the mother and other caregivers.\n\nContrary to folk wisdom, most laughter is not about humor; it is about relationships between people. To find out when and why people laugh, I and several undergraduate research assistants went to local malls and city sidewalks and recorded what happened just before people laughed. Over a 10-year period, we studied over 2,000 cases of naturally occurring laughter.\n\nWe found that most laughter does not follow jokes. People laugh after a variety of statements such as “Hey John, where ya been?” “Here comes Mary,” “How did you do on the test?” and “Do you have a rubber band?”. These certainly aren’t jokes.\n\nWe don’t decide to laugh at these moments. Our brain makes the decision for us. These curious “ha ha ha’s” are bits of social glue that bond relationships.\n\nCuriously, laughter seldom interrupts the sentence structure of speech. It punctuates speech. We only laugh during pauses when we would cough or breathe."
Acoustic guitars cannot be plugged in. They have no electronics. Acoustic /Electric guitars look the same as Acoustic[they are both hollow-bodied]. The only difference is that Acoustic/Electrics can be plugged in. They have a jack and a small pickup which is not highly visible yet allows the instrument to be plugged into an amplifier which increases the volume of the instrument[also allows electronic effects to be added to enhance sound quality during performance].

The Gift\nby:Aselin Debison \n\nA poor orphan girl named Maria\nwas walking to market one day\nshe stopped for to rest by the road side\nwhere a bird with a broken wing lay\na few moments passed till she saw it\nfor its feathers were covered with sand\nand soon clean and wrapped it was traveling\nin the warmth of Maria's small hand\n\nshe happily gave her last peso\non a cage made of rushes and twine\nshe fed it loose corn from the market\nand watched it grow stronger with time\n\nnow the gift-giving service was coming\nand the chruch shone with tinsel and light\nand all of the town folk brought presents\nto lay by the manger that night\n\nthere were diamonds, incense and perfumes\nand packages fit for a king\nbut for one ragged bird in a small cage\nMaria had nothing to bring\n\nshe waited till just before midnight\nso no one would see her go in\nand crying she knelt by the manger\nfor her gift was unworthy of him\n\nthen a voice spoke to her through the darkness\nMaria what brings you to me\nif the bird in the cage is your offering\nopen the door let me see\n\nso she trembled she did as he asked her\nand out of  the cage the bird flew\nsoaring up into the rafters\non a wing that had healed good as new\n\njust then the midnight bells rang out\nand the little bird started to sing\na song that no words could recapture\nfor its beauty was fit for a king\n\nnow Maria felt blessed just to listen\nto that cascade of notes sweet and long\nas her offering was lifted to heaven\nby the very first nightingale's song

He kind of improved but only because the story is so good. The film has been re-made twice before the original is the best with Burt Reynolds. But if you like Adam Sandler you will like his version. For me lock stock is Vinnie's best film.

Well, they're not best friends, but they're not enemies either.  They just don't visit each other like the way she does with Brooke Shields, or the way she hangs out with Posh Beckham.  I think there is definitely tension between them because Nicole is Tom's ex-wife after all.  I remember that in the beginning of Katie & Tom's relationship, it was reported that there was some sort of argument/disagreement/unpleasant talk between the 2 of them when Nicole called Tom's house once to talk to her 2 kids, Isabella & Connor, but Katie answered the phone.  But regardless, it has been said that Nicole wishes the newlyweds the best and a lifetime of happiness.  After all, Nicole is the children's mother and Katie is their step-mother, so they do have to get along.  At least, they are not having an ugly, nasty public feud like some people.

What do you want to know about it?\n\nTransposition is the interval that notes have to be moved up or down for certain instruments to be able to play in concert with a piano or other non-transposing instrument.\n\nFor instance, the soprano clarinet and the trumpet are B-flat pitched instruments (because of the way they are built). In order for them to play the same note middle-C as the piano, you must write (or play) the note 1 step higher on their part ( in this case the D just under the treble clef).\n\nPlease elaborate on your question if you need more. I'll check back.

I was dumfounded at their kindness and generosity. I will never forget that.

no, i dont think they're bisexual. i mean, i didn't see that incident, but often times drunk straight girls will make out wiht each other..or just will make out in the heat of the moment even if they're not drunk. doesn't mean they're bisexual or lesbians - it just happens.
Sometimes name dropping works and other times it works against you. Sorry to say, it did the latter.

"Hi I worked in the forwarding department and my best advice is for you to contact the magazine. We would send a form 3579 change of address to the periodical publishers & many times they took forever to change your address if at all. We forward the magazine for 60 days, hoping you will notify the sender. Then after that we notify the sender of your new address for up to 60 days. If you notify your publisher you did not recieve an issue due to a move they will more than likely send you out another. Good luck with your new move!\nPS Their address is listed in the first 5 pages, the editorial section, or the last 5 pages of the magazine. For the USPS it always starts with ""Postmaster send address change to"", but if you find another addresses sometimes listed for customers, use that instead.. . .I think ours come in bulk to them & get put in their ""to do"" pile."

"SCORPIO goes with Taurus, Cancer, Virgo and Capricorn. \n\nBest Match For Scorpio Is Capricorn\nThese two can not only understand one another extremely well, but can actually match sensitivities and emotions, almost (if not actually) on a psychic level. A very long lasting relationship, these two seldom ever break up.\n\nWorst Match For Scorpio is Aries\nThe somewhat possessive Scorpio will never go for the love them and leave them attitude that Aries sometimes seems to exhibit. It's not that Aries are immoral, it is just that they give this impression too often to get along for great periods with the Scorpio. Also, the ""depth"" of Scorpio is somewhat foreign to Aries. \n\nLove & Blessings \nMilly"

There are several ways.  The best is most likely the traditional path of college/university in a film program.  \n\nIn many larger cities you can also use equipment provided by the local cable companies.  This is usually for free and they often provide instruction as well.\n\nLastly you can just buy a digital camcorder and a good PC or Mac and dive in.
"To be very honest I don't think this movie I really a ""War"" film. I think the main focus is on people of America at the time.

That was great.  He tried to retaliate by locking my bag in a cabinet.  Even took lunch early so he'd be back in time to be there when I left.  I noticed the padlock, so I got a screwdriver, took off the handle, retrieved my bag and put the handle back on.  If only you could have seen his face when I said goodbye - with my bag!  Then I found this really sticky stuff, kinda like putty but doesn't come off.  Stuck the handset of his phone to the base but good!  He couldn't get all the sticky off, so he switched handsets with my phone.  Well, another coworker answered my phone first and it got stuck to her head!!  LOL  The gift that keeps on giving....There's so many more....

I worked in the Adult Film Industry (Wherehouse Distribution) in the San Fernando Valley a few years back, & there was a company by the name of Elegant Angel that put out their films on red VHS tapes. It was pretty high quality work. Top of the line.

OMG! I love that show....but no.  I don't think House will do any time.  I think shortly he and the cop will come to an understanding with each other and the cop will no longer pursue the charges.\n\nI think it will come to a head soon though as house is starting to feel the pressure and I'm sure some sense of guilt especially after last nights episode where wilson has given up his practice.

How can it be that most people answering this question don't understand that it is a joke?  Have people lost their sense of humor?  Do we take everything we hear at face value, unless someone holds up a big sign that says, I am joking?  Or are most people just plain stupid?

Prices range from $27.25-$47.25 at Ticketmaster.  I was lucky enough to get 3rd row seats during the presale for $47.25 each.  You can't beat that!  If you want good seats now, you might have to go through a ticket broker and pay anywhere from $90.00 to $250.00+ per ticket (like on http://www.tickets.org ) .  I hope you find the seats you want, for a cool price.  Have fun if you go!!!

Check him out on the Sci-Fi channel to see some amazing and innovative tricks. If you have TiVo, you'll definitely be rewinding and using the slow-motion buttons on your remote just to see if you can figure out how he did what he did. There is this one episode a season or two ago where he stuck his hand right through a man's chest that was so outrageous you had to rewind it just to make sure you saw what you thought you saw. It's entertainment and it will definitely suspend reality as you know it for the time that you watch his show."

There is no month that would describe my personality adequately
A 17-year old boy holds a hospital hostage because he wants them to save his sister who is dying from lung cancer. He only wants a certain doctor, who is not there, and they can't find. Matt talks with the boy on the phone as Emily goes on a mission to find the missing doctor who appears to have dropped over the face of planet. They show flashbacks of Matt when he was a little boy, running through a hospital. It turns out when he was younger, his mother, who was a cop, was shot and later died in the hospital. Matt tells MJ (the boy) that he hates hospitals and he knows what he's going through. Emily finally tracks down the doctor who tells her he doesn't work for terrorists and won't come with her. She later convinces him to come and they arrive just in time before the SWAT team attempts to take MJ out. After MJ gives himself up and the doctor takes a look at his sister, he tells MJ there is no chance she'll survive, only lasting maybe 1 or 2 months. They cuff MJ and go to take him away but Matt uncuffs him and tells him to spend his last moments with his sister before she dies. \n\nIt was a pretty good episode in my opinion. I loved how Matt related with MJ. Matt was getting emotional when talking to him (not crying or anything, just angry) and he could really relate to MJ.

Jay-Z by far. Diddy may be the better promoter in terms of hyping things up and relating to the people, but Jay is the better businessman. He basically owns the nets, has the Rocawear clothing line which is booming in the clothing industry, he has multi million advertising deals with Budweisier and Dell, and he is now President and CEO of Def Jam records, the biggest of all recording industrys. He has much more money and is well on his way to being the first rap billionaire, and will become this in our lifetime.

Of course it's true. She's not fighting so hard to say it's not true because she's trying to protect her reputation! She's sold sex since she asked the world to hit her one more time. If there wasn't a tape, she'd let the story play out since it gives her publicity...and not any publicity she isn't already familiar with, right?!! Because there's a tape, she's fighting like crazy... That would be the absolute end for her and she knows it. Her star can't hold up against any more scandal...she's no longer bullet proof in entertainment like some people are...Robert Downey, Jr., Tom Cruise (though he's hanging on by threads too), etc... Some people can withstand whatever is thrown at them - no matter how damaging, and still come out on top. Britney married K-Fed (PUHLEEEEEZ!), had two kids (she's what now - 23? 25?), and completely dissed Justin (just about the hottest male vocalist today) who is loved by millions. And then her interview with Matt Lauer - eeewwww. She might as well have shown up in overalls with a piece of straw in her mouth and a little gravy dripping down her chin. She made hillbillies look good and that's hard to do. She won't survive any more scandalous publicity. She's just not THAT innocent...

I've used Limewire for awhile now, and I'm pretty happy with it.  Ares is kinda slow and it's hard to find rare songs, videos, etc.  I tried Bearshare for a little bit and got the same results.  I'd say stick with Limewire, but make sure you scan every file before you open it.\n\n.

The Others are holding Jack, Kate and Sawyer prisoner, and basically using them for slave labor. The Others spy on Jack, Kate and Sawyer.

The Survivors, on the other hand, did nothing but try to survive until the Others got involved.\nAny questions?

"I was watching ""Grey's Anatomy"" last week when I saw a commerical saying that ""Desparate Housewives"" were up next. I was like ""WHAAAT?!?!?!?!"" Seriously, I did that! Then I checked tv.yahoo.com and there it was, ""6 Degrees"" was supposed to be on, so I said ""WHAAAT?!??!"" again and then checked tvguide.com too and yep, it said ""Desparate Housewives"" was on. UGH...unfortunately it looks like the show may actually end up being canceled. The next episode is set to air January 2007, but TBD. Yeah, I know that sounds kinda weird, but that's what it says on the website http://abc.go.com/primetime/sixdegrees/index.html\n\nJanuary, 2007\nTBD\n""Slings and Arrows""\nLaura gets her first date since her husband died. It begins well, but when she and Andrew visit a gallery opening, Laura is shocked to discover a photo that Caseman took of her weeping on her front stoop as part of the exhibit. Meantime, Whitney is horrified to learn that her ex-fianci, Roy, has acquired one of her clients, which forces her to work with the man who broke her heart, and Carlos learns Damian's secret about the shooting."

I played a Hamer 8 and 12 string bass and the sound that comes out of them is just incredible. They were really made well and have great electronics on them. You can find a whole website on this by clicking below:
I was really upset that they took Benson away, I liked her a lot more than Beck, who just really pissed me off. I'm glad she's back and I think last nights episode showed she's a true detective who can handle anything. I think Elliot and Olivia should end up together anyway, and he shouldn't go around kissing other girls.
Just stay away from him outside of class.  bring this behavior to the attention of another school staff member and ask them to try to watch and catch him at it.  He could be dangerous.
interesting
lol yes it was funny
no i dont know of them  but try itunes, limewire, amazon or try a google search. good luck!!!!!

I rarely cry, As a man, I don't feel the need too very often. I am not saying that women shouldn't or that they are weak because they do. I just don't get very emotional. If I do get to the point to where I am crying then I really don't care who is around. I am a grown up and if I think I should cry then hopefully people won't see me as a child or to emotional but if they do then they don't have very many brains and are very ill educated. Crying is a very important part of life and I think it is a healthy thing to do some times.

"I was watching the first episode of the new season yesterday. It seems like it is going to pretty good. But Taylor is pissing me off. I just don't like her character.

I just don't get how she and Seth broke up again. Weren't they together in ""The Graduates""?"

2pac will always be timeless. Look at how many cds he sold since he has died. Biggie was great. Shakur is greater. He is the Biggest selling hip hop artist of all time, 38 million or better, and six albums alive while only nine after he passed on. Imagine how much new stuff he would have wrote had he lived. Put east coast west coast or democrat or republican aside and pick the best candidate. Tupac in 2006
Alone, I would say I would let my son go MAYBE if he proved to be responsible, by the age of 17.  If another parent that I had met before and trusted was taking him, I would probably let him go at 13.  No, I wouldn't feel it would be necessary for me to go with him if the adult taking him was responsible enough, which if he wasn't, he wouldn't be going without me anyway, and I wouldn't need the other adult to go with us!  :-)

I think a lot of Hollywood relationships are based on physical attraction. You can't base a marriage just on a pretty face! I also think some couplings produce good PR for both stars, which boosts audiences at their movies. Again, good PR is a poor excuse to get married.\nP.S.  I'd LOVE to see Britany Spears when she's 70; I wonder if she'll still try to expose everything she's got? LOL :)

There is a class of people who are influenced by the review of the critics. If the critics opine that the movie is not good then that group start spreading these information to the masses and hence the wrong massages passes.\nI am a movie goer and I had seen the old as well as new Don and u will be shocked to note that i liked the new Don better than the old Don. It is like a Hindi version of a Hollywood movie. It moves so fast that u hardly have time to talk to your friend. Only the plot is same but the whole movie is quite different with stars like sharukh, kareena and priyanka. This movie is going to click. just mark my words. Congrats to F.Akhtar who incorporated very good locations, posh cars, scenic locations and a very surprising end. the New Don is packed with full 'masala' and nothing is going to stop its success.

Galactus hands down. His hearlds have only a minute amount of his power and they have beaten the best Marvel has. Also he is one of the three universal constructs of the Marvel universe along with Eternity and Death. To sum it up, he would beat the s*** out of Gah Lak Tus, who is just a big insect.

Merton, Thomas \n \n \n1915—68, American religious writer and poet, b. France. He grew up in France, England, and the United States and studied at Cambridge Univ. and at Columbia (B.A., 1938; M.A., 1939). Converted to the Roman Catholic Church during his college career, he became in 1941 a Trappist monk. He was later ordained a priest and is known in religion as Father M. Louis. Merton died as a result of an accident in Thailand while attending an ecumenical council of Catholic and Buddhist monks. Among his volumes of poems are Figures for an Apocalypse (1947), The Tears of the Blind Lions (1949), and The Strange Islands (1957). Best known of his books are his autobiography, The Seven Storey Mountain (1948, repr. 1970), two volumes on Trappist life, The Waters of Siloe (1949) and The Sign of Jonas (1953, repr. 1973), and Mystics and Zen Masters (1967). His Seeds of Contemplation (1949), The Silent Life (1957), and New Seeds of Contemplation (1962, rev. ed. 1972) are volumes of meditations. Also of interest are his Disputed Questions (1960), Conjectures of a Guilty Bystander (1966), Faith and Violence (1968), Contemplation in a World of Action (1971), The Journals of Thomas Merton (Vol. I, 1995), and his Asian journal, ed. by Naomi Burton et al.

Yeah,she is dead.\nJean assumed the position of acting headmistress of the Xavier Institute and was revisited by the Phoenix Force. Following an attack on the X-Men by a mutant impersonating Magneto named Xorn (who had previously been a teacher at the institute), Jean and Wolverine were trapped on a space station that was hurtling into the sun. Seeing no hope for survival, and wanting to spare his teammate further suffering, Wolverine seemingly killed Jean, unleashing the Phoenix Consciousness within her and resurrecting her. Returning to Earth, Jean, with the power of the Phoenix, opposed the faux Magneto and was killed by a massive stroke induced by a lethal electromagnetic pulse.
Musical: Scarlet Pimpernel\nSong: The Riddle\n\n  \nSee the moon slink down in the sky, darling\nLet your fantasies fly, darling\nLife is cold, and the game is old\nJust see how virtue repays you\nYou turn and someone betrays you\nBetray him first\nAnd the game's reversed!\nFor we all are caught in the middle\nOf one long treacherous riddle\nCan I trust you? Should you trust me too?\nWe shamble on through this hell\nTaking on more secrets to sell\nTill there comes a day when we sell our souls away!\nThrough the mist your lover is beckoning\nComes that moment of reckoning\nFaces change, even smiles grow strange\nAnd we all have so many faces\nThe real self often erases\nEnticing lies flicker through our eyes\nFeel the terror draw ever nearer\nThe more you stare in the mirror\nBut hold your own\nFace the wind alone\nReel on, love! Toughen your scars\nYear by year we're falling like stars\nTill there comes a day when we well our souls away!\nCan I run to you? Are you true to me?\nI'll do unto you as you do to me!\nAnd we slowly learn someone has to burn\nBetter you than me!\nOh, every Judas once loved a Jesus\nBut finally treason will seize us\nAnd only fools follow golden rules\nWe all are caught in the middle\nOf one long treacherous riddle\nOf who trusts who, maybe I'll trust you\nBut can you trust me?\nWait and see!

"Aquarius\nJanuary 21-February 19 \n""I Know""\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nPlanet: Uranus\n\nKey phrase: ""I Know""\nSymbol: The Water Bearer\n\nQuality: Fixed\nElement: Air\n\nDuality: Masculine\nColor:  Electric Blue\nGem: Amethyst\n\nBody Part: Shins and Ankles\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nMany people get confused that Aquarius is a water sign, as it's symbol is the water bearer and the 'aqua' in the name. However, these people are most definitely air signs. They have a way with other people, they really do. If they're a bad Aquarius, they're good at manipulating. If they're a good Aquarius, they can really change the world and get things into motion. Another reason they are obviously not water signs is that they find extreme emotional displays as kind of a put-off. They say what they feel and that's it. There's usually nothing else behind it. If they're mad, they're mad and that's that. But if a cancer's mad, they're sad, too, they just won't say it. They're the people who want to say the right thing, and when you're done crying they'll go with you to kick the other guy's ass. They also have a tendency to make weird noises, be humming or fidget. They can't help it, however. And don't be offended if they just start talking in the middle of a sentence of yours, because it really isn't their fault they haven't been listening, as their minds WANDER. There is no doubt about that. I think every Aquarius could be diagnosed with ADD at one point or another. That's not to say that they can't be good listeners when interested, or when they know it's important. They're actually quite good at listening, when they focus on it.\nAnd maybe it's just me, but I've noticed that they all have some tacky sentimental thing that they lugg around with them. My boyfriend Zak wears these shoes that are basically extra socks they're in such bad shape. But he loves them. And my mother had the same hat for 15 years. Christ.\nIt was no mistake when someone called Aquarius the 'banner carrier', as they are well known to start revolutions and reform. It even gets down to someone being picked on or a rather nasty over-the-shoulder comment being completely blown away by the Aquarius righteousness. They can't STAND to see the underdog picked on. They feel sorry for wounded puppies to whole nations of people. They're the one politely telling you that you're an asshole for making fun of the fat kid across the room. First they'll come in with the ""Hey, you wouldn't like it if they did that to you"" attitude, and if that doesn't work they'll come back with a ""Fuck you"" attitude.\nThey don't analyze as much as they reflect. And people naturally flock to them for advice. It isn't always advice the Aquarius will take themselves, however. They usually let people fuck them over or oppress them once or twice, but once they swear it off, it never happens again. The will these people have is incredible, and I think all of them are artistic in some way.\nThey LOVE to try new things, unless this aspect is outweighed by other signs in their chart, they'll also be the first person next to Pisces to say ""Oh my god"" after hearing some particularly heart wrenching tale from some victim. \nThey've all got a style all their own, and the house of a wealthy Aquarian would be a sight to behold. The other day I went to a restaurant in Baltimore, and let me tell you, my inner Capricorn fucking DIED. There were beat up mannequins on the ceiling, the walls, and they were painted weird, tacky colors and little army men were melted on as hair...and guh. The place looked like shit. And of course my friends loved it. Bastards. Anyway, I said that the owner HAD to be an aquarius, a"

I like the Black Eyed Peas the most, but I really can't choose because I like both.
Very cool idea!  I too would play the drums because there is more energy expended there then anywhere in a band.  I am sooo full of energy that there is rarely enough people or things to expend it.  Still love your idea about an air band with air manager! lol
I'm still trying to figure out what qualifies him to be an Extra host.  I'm not sure about the singing, but I'm guessing his career is sinking there.  As far as I know the tattoos are still there, especially the one on his neck , but I think he covers them with makeup/clothing.

Yes, without a doubt.  Disney is got to be one of the safest parks.  People die on the rides, but the law of averages says that it is going to happen.

"The song is ""Oh, Well"" and performed originally by the ""early"" version of Fleetwood Mac, when they were primarily a British blues outfit. It was written by their guitarist at the time, Peter Greene, who was one of those incredible talents who had some incredible problems. Sometime after Greene left the band, Fleetwood Mac spent some time in America where they picked up Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\n\nThe first studio version of the song goes on for about an hour it seems, and is only good for dropping acid (according to an old hippie I know.) The live version, recorded ""Live at the BBC,"" is the version we most often hear on classic rock radio. \n\nI've heard many covers of this song, and performed it many times on stage, but a version I heard recorded by Kenny Wayne Shepherd a few years ago knocked me outta my seat. Please check it out, if you have the means."

I liked the ending. I know of a few people who didn't but I thought it was a good way for SK to let his readers use their imaginations to decide how they wanted the story to turn out. I doubt this will be the last we hear about these characters since many of SK books intertwine with one another.

"A cotillion is presented kinda like a party, but it has the benefits of a class. It teaches social graces to both boys and girls. We put our son in it when he was 12 and he really enjoyed it. He had to dress up to go once a week, and they had ""theme"" weeks. He learned how to dance, how to do all the social nice-ities. And he learned that manners isn't just something ""Mom says"" should be used."

I support anyone standing up for what they believe, but I think that Jay-Z may be picking on something small when he could be tackling more important offenders.  Attacking Cristal for being racist won't really affect the Cristal people.  Kanye West starting a movement against the president inspires a bit more conversation.
I don't know about that, but I know he couldn't catch a break.

"Try Monty Python movies such as ""The Life of Brian"", ""And Now For Something Completely Differnt"", or the infamous: ""And the Quest for the Holy Grail.""  You might first want to look up Monty Python or Monty Python Flying Circus on Yahoo! videos to see if you like their humor.  It's British, but extremely eccentric.  Next, their is any movie by Mel Brooks (e.g. The History of the World Part I, Young Frankenstein, Robin Hood, Men in Tights, etc. etc.), or you could try Airplane! (that one is hilarious!)\nIf you can, and are a fan of zombie movies, try and watch Shaun of the Dead.  Great!!  It makes fun of the old zombie movies, and even includes such classic lines as ""They're coming to get you Barbara!"" (from the original black and white Night of the Living Dead).  Great Stuff."

GET FUZZY, GARFIELD
"Early versions include the line ""I dig no Pakistani's."" The song began as a commentary about immigration, telling people to ""Get Back"" to their own countries. It was meant to mock Britain's anti-immigrant proponents. Paul McCartney thought better of it and made the lyrics more obscure.  \n\n""Get Back"" was going to be the title of the Let It Be album. The concept was The Beatles ""getting back"" to their roots and playing new songs for a live audience without any studio tricks. This song came closest to capturing that spirit, but the album became something completely different when they decided to scrap the idea of a live album. Glyn Johns, who engineered the sessions was asked to put the album together from what were really rehearsal tapes. After he put the album together, it sat around while the Let It Be Movie was being edited from the film footage of The Beatles rehearsing in the studio and playing on the rooftop. During this time, The Beatles made the Abbey Road album, released it, and broke up. John Lennon had Phil Spector produce his solo song ""Instant Karma,"" which Harrison played on. They liked Spector's work and asked him to produce the Get Back album, which was re-titled Let It Be. Spector took the tapes and added orchestrations using his ""Wall Of Sound"" technique, and the album that was supposed to be the raw sound of The Beatles returning to their roots was released as a highly-produced final album after they had broken up. \nIn their early days, The Beatles played in clubs for hours most nights, but by 1967, they stopped touring. This single was advertised as ""The Beatles as nature intended."" \nAt the beginning of the album version, Lennon sang, ""Sweet Loretta fat she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan."" He was making fun of the first line in the song. \nAt the end of the album version, Paul says ""thanks Mo"" in response to Ringo's wife, Maureen, who was clapping. \nThe press release to promote the single contained this quote from McCartney: ""We were sitting in the studio and we made it up out of thin air... we started to write words there and then... when we finished it, we recorded it at Apple Studios and made it into a song to roller coast by."" \nLennon claimed this was basically a rewrite of their 1968 song ""Lady Madonna."" \nThe single version is longer than the album version. Usually it is the other way around. \nPaul looked at Yoko in the studio when he sang the line ""get back to where you once belong."" John thought he was disrespecting her. \nMcCartney got the idea for this from the line, ""Get back to where you should be,"" which came from a song Harrison wrote called ""Sour Milk Sea,"" which was eventually recorded by Jackie Lomax. McCartney changed the line to, ""Get back to where you once belonged."" \nThe character ""JoJo"" was probably based on Joseph Melville See Jr., Linda McCartney's first husband. He was from Tucson, Arizona, and killed himself there in 2000. \nBilly Preston played piano and became the only guest artist to get a credit on a Beatles single when this was credited to ""The Beatles with Billy Preston."" After George Harrison left the sessions, he saw Preston in concert with Ray Charles. The Beatles met Preston in 1962 when they were both playing in Germany, but they hadn't seen each other since. Harrison asked Preston to come by the studio the next day, where he played on this and ""Don't Let Me Down."" Having him in the studio eased the tension and made it easier for The Beatles to put personal conflicts aside and record the album."
Go in with an open mind and ask your angels and guardian spirits to guide their advice.
Some professional actors rub a small amount of vicks just under the eye. This will prduce real tears but too much will cause you eyes too run uncontrably. I suggest wiping a ting amount on the checkbone as this will make your eyes water. Of course its all in your acting ability to make the audience really feel it. Good luck! x
go to court and have a judge decide
I change all the time because i love so many bands but as of right now i would have to pick The Used. I absolutely love their songs because each one somehow can relate to a situation in my life and i love Bert's voice. i like how he sings and screams in all of their songs.

Considering that the studio were attempting to cash in on the recent upsurge in Comic book adaptations then it is quite possible that they were looking to attract a certain audience. The first is easy, i.e. people like yourself who are readers of the comic and would go and see the movie just to see what they did with it. Second audience would be anyone who was remotely interested in Keanu Reeves, the biggest percentage being women aged between 15 and 45 therefore by not alluding to the bisexuality that is present in the comic they would not alienate this second and possibly bigger audience thus ensuring their profit margins. I know a little cynical but hey! and anyway throughout the movie Constantine doesn't seem really turned on by either male or female instead we are lead by the reactions of Rachel Weiz's character who seems more attracted to him than he is to her hence no kiss. But what do I know  - in scenes cut he might have been running around snogging everything that moved and wearing a pink feather boa interesting concept for the next movie no?

"Kirk Douglas (born December 9, 1916) in Amsterdam, NY. is an American actor and film producer known for voice and his recurring roles as the kinds of characters Douglas himself once described as ""sons of bitches"". He is also father to Hollywood actor and producer Michael Douglas.\n\nEarly life:\nDouglas was born Issur Danielovitch Demsky in Amsterdam, New York to Herschel Danielovitch and Bryna Sanglel, poor Belarusian Jewish parents (who came from Homel, also known as Gomel). He was on the wrestling team at St. Lawrence University. To help make his way through college, he thought getting an acting scholarship might work. His talents got him noticed at the acclaimed American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, where he soon received a scholarship, alongside classmate Betty Joan Perske (better, and soon to be, known as Lauren Bacall). He then served in the U.S. Navy from entry of the US intoWorld War II in 1941 until it ended in 1945. After the war he returned to New York City and started doing radio theater and commercials, while trying to break in on Broadway.\n\nDouglas was helped by actress Lauren Bacall in obtaining his first screen role in the Hal B. Wallis movie, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers 1946, starring Barbara Stanwyck. Hal B. Wallis was on his way to New York to look for new talent when Bacall suggested he look up her old drama school classmate, who was working in an off-Broadway play at the time.\n\nCareer:\nKirk Douglas received three Academy Award nominations for his work in Champion, The Bad and the Beautiful and Lust for Life (as Vincent Van Gogh). Douglas did not win any competitive Oscars, but received a special Oscar in 1996 for ""50 years as a moral and creative force in the motion picture community.""\n\nHe also played an important role in breaking the Hollywood blacklist by publicly opposing Stanley Kubrick's intention to take credit for the screenplay of Spartacus, which had been adapted from Howard Fast's novel by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo. Douglas had collaborated closely with Kubrick in Paths of Glory, where Douglas played one of his most memorable roles, as Colonel Dax, the commander of a French regiment during World War I ordered to make a suicidal attack.\n\nFor his contributions to the motion picture industry, Kirk Douglas has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Blvd. In 1984, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.\n\nIn October 2004, the avenue ""Kirk Douglas Way"" in Palm Springs, California was named in his honor by the Palm Springs International Film Society and International Film Festival.\n\nDouglas has been married twice, first to Diana Dill (born January 22, 1923; married November 2, 1943 - divorced in 1951), with whom he had two sons, actor Michael Douglas and producer Joel Douglas. And then to his second wife, Anne Buydens (married May 29, 1954 to the present) with whom he has two sons, producer Peter Vincent Douglas born November 23, 1955 and actor Eric Douglas (born June 1958; died July 6, 2004 of an accidental drug overdose).\n\nPopular at home and around the world, Kirk Douglas received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981, the French Legion of Honor in 1985, and the National Medal of the Arts in 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Kirk Douglas suffered a stroke, partly impairing his ability to speak."

good 4 u.. hahaha
My advice for you would be to check-out some older movies that you haven't seen. If you liked movies such as Saw, than I would recommend Cube. If you like action movies, than The Italian Job would be great. \n\nIt may not be a movie, but I'm hooked on the oldMission Impossible t.v. series. I just check them out from the library.
I think it is on CBS. The reason I say this is because I am from Arkansas and the local news station throws the dart on a map of Arkansas and they travel to that place in the state. They call it Everyone has a Story. I think they can use it as long as they are affiliated with CBS. Hope this helps....

It a must to see how people's passion about something can lead to change for the better.\nLes Choriste is touching, like a Mister Chips but in French, same actor is in Monsignor Batignole.

"To a certain degree, yes. \nBut things run in cycles. There was a lull in progressive music in the '80's after the ""art-rock"" explosion of the '70's. Then, during the latter part of the decade, ""Prog"" started to make a come-back. \nNow, it seems as though it's hit another lull in the amount of true prog-rock bands that are out there. However, there are several excellent ""Prog-Art-Rock"" bands around.(The Mars Volta, Univers Zero, Cryptic Vision, Kino, The Flower Kings, etc.) The real trick is finding any of their material - especially, in the U.S. (Try these websites: www.prog4you.com - or - progarchives.com)\nProg music will always be around - it just will never gain any sort of mainstream acceptance. Which is good, because look what happened to ""Metal"" in the '80's when it became popular. I'm glad something finally came along to slay that monster. But why did it have to be ""Grunge""?"
"""Orchésographie"" by Thoinot Arbeau is probably the best CD of galliard dance music and has 40 tracks on the CD."
As you suggest, it was used in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.  It is used to refer to a time where people were younger and far more carefree.  It always reminded me of the deliciousness of the early spring crop of vegetables in Italy, especially.  Each vegetable is so sweet and delicious that any melange seemed like a banquet and they practically required no seasoning, perhaps just a bit of steam and some cold pressed olive oil.  Hence I see salad days as that which is youthful, fresh, filled with flavor and the innocence by which youth will always be oblivious of the hardships and heavy responsibilities yet to come.

I used to sing professionally in a Top 40 band in the 80's. I wonder if you are speaking about in a performance setting. In that case, you always start with a fast, driving song to get the energy in the room up. As far as band sets go, this is the usual fare: 6 - 8 songs per 40 minute set (20 minute breaks in between) and a distribution of something like 2 slow, 4 -5 fast OR 1 slow, 4 - 6 fast depending on the songs used per set.  If you are doing a one number performance go for something very driving and energetic and meaty ........if you are doing 2 numbers start with the fast and end with a slow song. If doing 3 songs, do fast, slow, fast.  And save the very best for last. Whatever you do, make each song one that brings the house down and has the audience 'over the moon' with your performance.
it could be the confidence she gives off or her looks maybe even the personality. but people might just like her for how she is portrayed and comes off with other people, no one is perfect but if your happy with yourself and have confidence it will show and people will be attracted.

two points--one u asked for--one u didnt\n\n1. keep the homefires burning means the people back at home (not on the warfront) have to keep going, keep a lamp in the window, keep their country okay for when the soldier comes home\n\n2. Johnny Got His Gun is a book (by Dalton Trumbo) and then a movie of the same name. It's about a badly wounded soldier who  is in a coma but is trying to discover how badly wounded he is. Both the book and movie are great, and I think Metallica uses part of the movie in their video(I havent seen it in a long time)

You thought you left at 10:55 am, 65 minutes before noon. The clock actually read 1:05 pm, so 20 minutes later you reached work at 1:25 pm, seemingly 2 and a half hours later.\n\nEdit:\nOK, I made a mistake, it could be 65 mins either side of 12 o'clock or 6 o'clock. But as you arrived in the morning it could only be 7:05 am reflected to 4:55 am so you arrive at 7:25 am making the answer 295 mins.\n\nOr 1:05 am reflected to 10:55 pm so you arrive at 1:25 am (less likely working hours) would make the answer 655 mins before noon.

I match in most of the description but as I put elsewhere, it depends on many factors not just the sun sign on how the scorp will handle itself.\nI am very secretive about certain areas whereas others I am open, I am very friendly and out going but at times will hide off to be alone to regroup... I can be very seductive (attracting woman who are sometimes out of my normal MO for dating), highly emotional to the point of almost getting fired about once a year for not keeping my emotions in check  and am not vindictive unless someone so totally messes with me that the emotional side usually surfaces first.

Hey, SCORPIONS are never suited for VIRGO. wanna know why ? You see, VIRGO is ruled by MERCURY and SCORPIO is ruled by MARS. and mercury and mars dont get along with each other. according to indian astrology both are neutral to each other but generally dont give good results, making the person hot tempered. Mercury is friends with SUN and VENUS. so you can tate LEO, TAURUS and LIBRA. \nAvoid CANCER because MERCURY is enemies with MOON and CANCER is ruled by MOON.

Because they mostly hire people who either don't care (high school kids and etc) or people who are really down and out and need the money. Those that really need the money usually have kids and whatever hassles that go with taking care of them. Those with children probably don't have the time and/or energy to organize such a group.
Do you mean Hudson Beach maybe? That's the only thing I can think of that sounds like what you've described. The two main restaurants are Sam's and Inn on the Gulf. Sam's has live music, but the Inn has better food and is a little less casual than Sam's. While you can show up barefoot and in a bathing suit at Sam's, you must be fully clothed to dine at the Inn. Nothing dressy, even shorts and a tank top will do. They also have a full bar with a large TV (usually ESPN). Hope this helps.
Yes.  My bf is a dj.  Everytime we go out of town, he looks for old record shops.  He spends hours going through the collections and always finds classic stuff for couple of bucks or less.  We also stop in while passing through small towns, time permitting.  He has hip-hop and r&b stuff mostly.
don't know, sorry.

"Names of bands should come naturally by something meaningful to the members. Also consider your particular style of music and something you all have in common. \n\nHere's a short little story about a band name. For awhile this band was called The Project, then later Reloaded as a sort of joke since 2 of the members were in a band called loaded. One day, while the band was watching a movie the word ""Revoultion"" came onto the screen. Naturally this jogged the memory of one of the members to a Beatles album, so he said another one ""Revolver."" Then the singer put ""Black Vevlet"" in front of it. They later Xed out the ""black"" and became a very excellent band with a fitting name ""Velvet Revolver."" Beautiful and Dangerous, just like the band."

"Summary of the eRumor\nThis piece of alleged history explains that in the olden days of sailing ships, cannon balls were stacked on the decks on brass plates called ""monkeys.""  The plates had indentions in them that held the balls on the bottoms of the stacks.  Brass, however, expands and contracts with the temperature and if it got cold enough, the cannon balls could fall...giving real foundation to the phrase ""cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!""  \n \n \n The Truth\nAccording to the United States Navy Historical Center, this is a legend of the sea without historical justification.  The center has researched this because of the questions it gets and says the term ""brass monkey"" and a vulgar reference to the effect of cold on the monkey's extremities, appears to have originated in the book ""Before the Mast"" by C.A. Abbey.  It was said that it was so cold that it would ""freeze the tail off a brass monkey.""   The Navy says there is no evidence that the phrase had anything to do with ships or ships with cannon balls."

I am even going to celebrate their 16 year celebration cause on August 1(it's the 41 day of summer) 16 years ago...they started the band but Cone didn't enter it till a couple months after that...I have ALL of their CD's and DVD's...I am still adding to my T-Shirt Collection from them...But the only thing that makes me a bad fan is I have never met or seen a concert of them because they have never came close to where I live...The only chance I had to seeing them is when they announced that they were going to the Vans Warped Tour and I was going to get the ticked but then they announced that they weren't going to be in it on the account of Dave leaving the band...Well,,,at least I am and will always be a true fan of Sum 41 and I don't care what anyone else thinks...

wrong question to ask although i agree sex is a great way to spend free time however if your not into sex twiddle your thumbs
As much as the show is lame and stupid I would have to admit its flippin unmissable at the moment!!!! I've never seen so much bitching and back stabbing.....its fab!!!\n\nI for one will be watching it and I hope two faced Grace gets booted!\n\n\nLONG LIVE PETE!!!! LOL (I really need to get a life).....
You bunch of sissies, Friday the 13th is far more scarier than Nightmare on Elm Street!  Look at the facts, dreams are over-rated; I have nightmares every night and wake up in the morning and my pants are still dry.  But if you watch Friday the 13th at 12:00am and go for a walk in my neck of the woods, I promise you, by the time you come out of the woods, you will have peed all over yourself.  There is some freaky stuff out there in the woods, let me tell ya, especially halfway out in the woods when your flashlight goes dead and all you can hear are weird sounds like footsteps coming to you or someone chopping something with a machete.  Then what would happen if you came face to face with a hockey-masked maniac holding that machete??!!!
are you serious? of course i would rather watch the simpsons and family guy
"I think there is basically no way Eric will be back for BBAS.  He has very little public support, and the premise of all stars is half of the players are voted in by the public, half put in by the producers.  On the male side for the public vote, it will likely be Evil Dr. Will, Kaysar, and Howie... mainly because the latter two are fresh on the public mind.  Cappy has a lot of competition to be put in by the producers, and there's been a lot more blown up personalities from other seasons that tend to be more of a star on their own series.  But hey, it would be cool if Cappy is on.  Could be a good addition to the ""Good vs. Evil"" theme they have this year.  Cheers!"

No he is not gay. He has had girlfriends in the past just that he keeps his life more private than other Hollywood stars.
i think Pete has a strong chance , also Nikki, although my favourite housemate at the moment is ashleen, but i don't think she'll win.
"All things considered, he was a  ""newer"" X-Man than most of the other characters in the movie.  Gambit has only been around since the early-1990s whereas all the other characters portrayed in the movie have been around since either the beginning or middle of the series.  Plus, Gambit's kinetically charged powers might have appeared to be too much like Pyro's or Cyclops', thus not adding any additional eye candy for the average movie viewer.  It sucks that he never made it in there, especially with Brett Ratner being so hellbent on including as many mutants as possible in the third movie.  They could have made a little room for Gambit, non?"

They had two other skits.  The first one was Two A-Holes Buying a Christmas Tree, when Jack Black hosted the show in December.  The second one was in March, I think and I believe it was called Two A-Holes Go To A Travel Agency or something like that.  This skit cracks me up!  The travel agency one is the best, I wanna go to Hogwarts!

From what I've read, it wasn't just ONE girl, it was a whole lot of girls that he cheated on Christina with (none of them have been famous, or at least that he has admitted and I'm pretty sure he would have..he's not exactly bashful)... and over the whole span of their relationship. Nice, huh?

Photography is an awesome hobby and can be started (especially these days with digital cameras and inexpensive computers) for very little money.  There is something about capturing a moment and being able to hold onto it forever.\n\nCollecting is a great hobby and you can easily collect something that appeals to you.  I used to collect comic books, but others collect stamps, or postcards, or bugs (ewww), or a wide variety of things.\n\nDecorating, now that's a hobby.  You can always find something in your house to decorate, or even elsewhere such as outside (landscaping) and it can be done in a house, an apartment, or just about anywhere.\n\nBeads are fun and you can make a lot of fun things such as necklaces or bracelets.\n\nReading is fun.  You can go on a bender and just start reading like mad.  Fiction, non fiction, fun and contemporary or even serious drama and the like.  The classics are great and by reading them you can be involved in a lot of conversations.  It also gives you some insight into the creation of many modern words and sayings.\n\nTake photography to another level and make your own films.  An inexpensive video camera and an apple (yes I'm biased) and you can make some fun awesome movies.\n\nAnd, I know this is way out there, but volunteering is truly an amazing thing to do.  Not only will you be keeping yourself busy and learning various skills, but you will be helping your brothers and sisters of the world.\n\nYou can volunteer in so many ways, from the simple act of helping feed the homeless or organizing the food bins at a local food shelter, to helping in the building of houses, helping at fund raisers, manning phones (why not womaning phones?), or just about anything else.\n\nI hope that you find a hobby that suits you and brings you joy.\n\nLove as always,\n\nSebastian

The WB is showing the past seasons episodes on Wednesdays @ 9pm EDT. The fourth season starts sometime in September.
Nope. The only way to ease hangovers is drink a glass or two of water before you go bed after a night of drinking, and take two Tylenol. Alcohol pulls the water out of your system (basically dehydrates you), and it's the lack of water that gives you a hangover. If you put water back into your body before you go to bed you won't get a hangover. Since I found this out, I haven't had a hangover in four years.
"well, im dont know wether ur a guy@gal..so,i just give u overall description bout both aquarius guy n gal!!\n\n\nAQUARIUS MAN \n\nHot-hearted man who likes to do thing  his way. He can suddenly decide to do something without thinking of it's  outcome. He is the type of guy with an inside energizer, so if you fall in  love with this type of guy be ""patient"", even if you have to follow him a  bit. His creative mind could create fantastic idea any time. If you do not  understand or can not follow him, you won't be with him for long. \n\nA  man in this Zodiac will less likely to have a pale skin, and if he has a scar, it would be on his face or on his head. He moves very fast and very energetic, and he has a very self confident in himself. He is not the type to sit down and feel sorry or regret anything for long, especially with ""Love"". He loves justice. He dares to show his opinion or even argue about certain subject even he knows it might bring him problems. A straight forward type of guy. He hardly lies except if he think it is  necessary and he is not a good liar anyway. He will not lie to you about  serious matter, but if he lie he will lie only a small little thing. He is  gifted with the ability to be a very social person. He could talk even about  subject that he has no knowledge of. He interests only at the present time  and look at the world positively. Many times he feels hurt because of  reality, but he will not run away and he will overcome that  difficulty. \n\nEven he is a high and self confident type and center his own   thought as a main focus, but at the same time he is a kind, cute and polite guy. He certainly is not a mean person. He likes to help people who are in troubles even he is not asked to. He is the type who feels sorry if you remember bad things he said to you that he had already forgotten,but you did not. Belief him that he is very sorry and give him another chance. Once he decides to do something, he will put all his mind and energy in it either in his ""Work"", or ""Love"". He is the type who gamble anything in the casino, so do not even take him there. He does not like pessimistic, low energy, and depress person, especially no brain. Strangely he like to overpowered this type of people to assure that he is more superior. \n\nHe like to be the first person to do something. You can see   sparkling in his eyes, once he meet a new target or new lover. Once he is in love, he will act as if he never has love like this before. This minute he could be real sugar sweet, and later he could also be an icy cold, but do not blame him for that will only chase him away. He could fall in love again with another girl and act again like he never has this kind of love before.He could really love someone, but not a heart broken type for he  thinks love is ""excitement"" and ""Love goes on"". If you date this kind of guy, do not or avoid showing your face to him with face pack, face mask, always be presentable, nice and cute. If he is quiet not because he is shy, but he is only quietly thinking. If you have a chance to ask his  X-girlfriend, she will tell you that he is not a shy or quiet type. If he is  really and truly in love with you, he will never lie to you at all. How do  you know if he loves you, bet on your faith! Love him and treat him steadily and do not try to find anything to argue with him, he will be with you for sure. \n\nIf you are his lover or girlfriend and need to tell him something,  go and say it out loud and straight forward because he hate long boring  story. He hate to play games, chasing for love or being chased, so let him  call you first. He likes a confident woman who also a good follower. If he gets mad at you, let him be for only a short time he will be normal again. You have to like and be able to get along with his friends, but he does not  have to do so with all your friends. \n\nDon't ever think you could make  him jealo"

"At first I had the ""Jesus theory"" about the song too. I thought he meant that Jesus left the glory of heaven ""The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind"" so he could come to lay down his life. And he's going to come back but they're asking why he left us all behind. But then I realized they probably werent talking about that. I think they meant that this man wants to die so his beauty can be preserved. But then again.....I don't know, I have my own personal meaning of the song."

People smoking during dinner is worse. When they talk during a movie, they will usually stop if you turn and give them a look. Smokers don't care if you give them a look. (I should say most smokers.) They just puff away and ruin the air.

Actually, You better go to the official site of J.K.Rowling! She's got a list of rumours! In that there are many things given about Harry Potter's seventh book. But just keep in mind that they are rumours!
Use stuff like first very weak monsters up to lvl3. Then get gravity bind (which prevents monsters from lvl4 and up to attack) and then get reinforcements, mallovent nuzzler and attach them to one monster and start Koing all of their monsters.  Also, You can summon some very high monsters like Black Luster Soldier so thatIf they have Jinzo, Remove trap or any thing that removes traps, you can still beat them.  Also try getting Swords of Revealing light so that if they kill your High Lvl Monsters, You still have a chance. After that try getting red medicine, Tremendous Fire, And Dian Keto The cure Master to heal and attack.\n\nWell thats about all I can give you and while your at it try finding your own play style.

In fact every female in there with the exception of Ash, and possibly Suzy can go, they're the most hateful spiteful jealous bunch of women ever to be in a BB house, and they don't do us proud.

Well , I don't think we know all of her powers yet.  Some that we have seen are her apparent invulnerablility (immortality?), she can heat up or cool down water, she can change the color of her eyes and hair (maybe other people's too?), she can levitate objects and people, she can hurt people (she did somthing to Matthew while she was levitating him), she can learn at an amazing rate and retain the knowledge.  Those are the ones I can think of right now.  I'm sure next week we'll see a new one.  Maybe she has the powers of all the 4400 in one person?
it is about a haunting in St. Francisville, La. I think it's called The Ghost of St. Francisville, or Haunting. It's about a haunted house on a plantation in St. Francisville Louisiana. I am from Louisiana and I have seen this movie. \n\n Mark

The Sign of Aquarius is symbolized by the Water Bearer. In much the same way that the Water Bearer brings that precious liquid as a gift, Aquarians shower the world with their thoughts and new ideas. Luckily for Aquarians (and the rest of us), they are at a near-genius level, so their minds churn out some amazing things. Their thought process is also inventive and original. While Aquarians are happy to bestow these ideas as a gift with no strings attached, they are much happier when the rest of the world agrees with them. Naysayers will quickly find out that Aquarians can be impatient, even temperamental, with those who disagree. Yes, these folks can be quite fixed in their opinions, in keeping with the Fixed Quality assigned to this Sign. Even though Aquarians are happy to give, and they do, it's often on their terms and within their comfort level. Generally, that means ample space, since these folks are freedom-loving and individualistic and need to roam (and yes, they do enjoy travel). While Aquarians are generally sympathetic and compassionate, they like it when things go their own quirky way. Some might call their behavior eccentric (and they would be right), but when you consider that the Aquarian's heart is truly in the right place, a few oddities should be overlooked. In their own way, Aquarians treasure their many friends and acquaintances and want to give back as much as they can.
i am a HUGE fan of nelly f. \nno she isnt married but was going out with a DJ named DJ lil jazz. she has a daughter though at the age of 2 or . her name is Nevis.
first of all i just wanna say for all you haters out derre that kiss wit da beautiful fantasia and da sexy jamie foxx wuz not disgusting and if you watched the bet awards you'll kno that it looked like neither one of them wanted to stop and before fantaisa walked away she smiled at jamie. oh yeah and if you watched the after show jamie said that they had planned a peck. so if he didn't like her why didn't he just stop kissing her? then when they walked off stage they were holding hands, so if they ain't dating  they are getting pretty close to. and yall kno damn well jamie foxx ain't married
none of them they just fell in love with each other(hello they are gay)
Sesshoumaru's mother is/was never mentioned. She's not a part of the main plot(or any of the main characters' lives).

I have the thrid movie and though you met(see) a younger Sesshoumaru, and his father(they're identical!), his mother is never mentioned or seen.\n\nMost likely, she won't ever be brought up.

Towels are the most useful thing it is possible to have handy in a crisis. One of the first things that Ford Prefect did for Arthur Dent after the demolition of the Earth was to equip him with a towel.\n\nThey can be used for snaring birds whilst falling from a three-mile high marble statue.\n\nThey can be used to signal temporally unstable spaceships by fossilizing them in planetary strata.\n\nThey can be soaked in nutrients to provide sustenance in awkward situations (Although, as Zaphod Beeblebrox found, this is not a terribly tasty solution to hunger).\n\nThey can also do a really good job of drying between your toes.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide is full of suggestions for successful towel deployment.

Yeah Michael Jackson is a sure fire reason for anyone to reconsider plastic surgery . But here's my philosophy on why people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies....\n\nThey say that your body is your temple so treat it with the utmost regard....well with plastic surgery you just renovating the walls , with tattoos your just getting them painted and for piercings your just getting some kick a** looking door knobs.

I haven't seen Hoobastank, so I'm not sure what to expect there, but I have friends in Germany to have been to a few 'Stank concerts and they loved them! I have, however, seen Chevelle and Nickelback. Chevelle wasn't my favourite out of the openers (we also had Trapt), but they didn't put on too bad a show. My father loves them. \n\nNickelback, well...expect nothing less than amazing from them. I've seen them four times in concert and they have gotten better and better each time. And I got front row the last time I saw them in March...absolutely brilliant!

The best way to finance a college comedy movie is to steal the answers to the big history final and sell them for 100 bucks a pop. However, a more sensible (and legal) idea would be to ask local businesses to pitch in (for some creatively place advertising, of course). Maybe, if you are talented, put on a show or concert and sell tickets.

"Dragnet-1954 it was ,Sgt. Joe Friday played by  Jack Webb.\n\nIn the 1952-59 series, viewers never saw the crime being committed. ""Dragnet"" was a mystery program; Sgt. Friday and Officer Smith would be called in to solve a crime, then locate and arrest the guilty party/parties. (As Webb put it, ""This makes YOU a cop, and you unwind the story."") ""Dragnet"" (1954) begins with the actual crime, so that we KNOW who's guilty even before the titles appear."

"Vladimir Semeonovich Visotskiy  ( 1938-1980 )\n\nVladimir Visotsk Without doubt, the most famous Russian bard was born in Moscow in 1938.\n\n   Visotsky graduated from the school of acting at the Moscow Arts Theatre in 1960. From 1964 he worked at the Moscow Theater of Drama and Comedy on Taganka. He wrote his first song in 1960 and would ultimately have a significant influence on an entire genre of music.\n\n   His gruff voice and starkly, sometimes slyly, poetic lyrics have inspired two generations of Russians and are working their way into the young hearts of a third. The end of his life was also occupied by his second wife, Marina Vladi, a popular French actress of Russian descent. He died in 1980 from a heart attack, the death knell of a creative life lived too fast. The Soviet government, always aiming to please, erected a monument to him in Moscow, apparently contrary to his wishes. Whether the government did it well or clumsily, the point was made by an entire society as it mourned the death of their Shakespeare-with-a-guitar.\n \nDuring his study in the Nemerovich-Danchenko acting school-studio at MHAT Visotsky wrote just a few songs. His main passion were short stories featuring Seryozha - employee of the Central Boiler House, Vasyochek (Visotsky's nickname) and others. However as many other students Vladimir sang quite often, mainly ""street songs"" and thief's cant that he learned in the Lev Kocharyan company on Big Karetny."

Bj and the bear- B.J. McCay was a good-looking young trucker who traveled around the country in his big red & white rig, with a single companion - his pet chimp, Bear. B.J. was based in rural Georgia and was confronted by a succession of corrupt local sheriffs - Elroy P. Lobo (who was later given his own series, Lobo); Sgt. Wiley of Winslow County and his two fellow lawmen, Sheriffs Cain and Masters. The only honest cop B.J. seemed to encounter was the Fox, who spent much of her time trying to trap the crooked local cops. Tommy was a lady trucker friend and Bullets ran the local hangout, the Country Comfort Truck Stop.In 1981, B.J. settled down to run a trucking business in Los Angeles called Bear Enterprises. His new adversary was Rutherford T. Grant, a corrupt politician who headed the state Special Crimes Action Team. Grant was a silent partner in   TransCal, the largest trucking firm in California and stopped at nothing to stomp out potential competition. Because of Grant's intervention, B.J. found it impossible to get regular truck drivers to work for him and had to settle for a crew of 7 young, beautiful lady truckers, including a pair of identical twins and Grant's daughter, Cindy.\n   Hello Larry-Following the breakup of his marriage, radio talk-show host Larry Alder moved from Los Angeles to Portland, to get a fresh start. He got a job at a radio station KLOW, where Morgan Winslow became the producer for his phone talk show. Earl was Larry's obese engineer. Lary had been given custody of his two daughters, 13-year old Ruthie and 16-year old Diane. Glib and in total control of the air, he was much less sure of himself at home as the single parent of two maturing girls. Leona, a school teacher and neighbor, tried to bring a little of woman's touch to this chaotic household. Larry's ex-wife Marion ( Shelley Fabares) also turned up occasionally. Added to the regular cast in the fall of were former Harlem Globetrotters basketball star Meadowlark Lemon, playing himself as a owner of a sporting goods store, and Tommy, a 14-year old neighbor. In February 1980 Larry's retired father, Henry, also moved in.\n Yes, you can by them

It says the connection failed on where its supposed to let the song play, get limewire, www.limewire.com, it's free and you can search for music on there, and get it all for free, and save it, and then put it on your ipod(if you have one), but since you dont know the name of the song, try typing some of the lyrics in the search engine on limewire, and if you know the artist, then type his name in the search engine on limewire, and download a bunch of his songs, and keep listening to them and see if its his song that you liked, you can just preview the song because it has to load, if its on 8% you can preview it and if its not the start of the song then delete it and look for more, and if you find another link to where the song is and can get it to play either somewhere else or myspace, edit your post above and put it on additional details(link to the song), and ill see if i know, and i'll edit this post on the bottom and tell you if i know or not if you make it work the link work. And if you chose this as best answer, I'd appreciate it, thanks, and remember try to get the link working and I'll see if I know. :)\n\n\n\nEDIT: Ok, im going on limewire on my computer right now, and typing in crowded and ill tell you some of the lyrics in a second, i have to let the song load a little.\n\n\nEDIT NUMBER 2: Awesome, I'm glad you got it, saw your message, but just to see if i was right, is it Jeannie Ortega Featuring Papoose???

"I suggest that you get hold of a guitar tutor book like ""Teach yourself the guitar"" and work through the book fairly slowly. You will probably find that the fingers of your left hand will develop blisters from pressing on the frets, but with time these should disappear. \n\nAlthough you might want to learn fast it is better to try to build up your technique slowly and make sure that you are comfortable with one lesson before you move on to the next one. Lots of people learn to strum a few chords on the guitar, but it takes time and effort to learn to play it really well."

Well she just did a whole segment on the news-Dateline where she was crying out for the public to consider that they are only human.

I think Jessica should not be in another relationship until she grows up.  She is still young and figuring out who she is which is why she has her Daddy to tell her.  Once she is brave enough to be on her own and think for herself and not be selfish and spoiled, then and only then should she start dating.\n\nAs for Nick, he should move on.  He's to smart for Jessica and much to practical.  I hope he uses his brain next time to find someone and not his ...

"I don't know what it names means. But I have that movie somewhere.  It was basically your typical softcore 80's hentai.\nWell, softcore in the sense that it didn't actually show penetration.\nBut it did show a girl getting ripped in half by a huge monsters um...thingie. That was freakish.  It's fun to make fun of, because it's so weird.  If you mean the remake though, I have no idear.  I've only seen the old one.  Oh also, one guy licks another guys sperm off this girls cheek.  It was gross.\n\nOh, it's basically about this kid (I forget his name) who is basically about to be transformed into some sort of demon god, or something. And a brother and sister team are sent to find him, only the sister thinks that it's someone else, and the brother is right and knows that it's the kid who the story revolves around and he has weird hair and whiskers like a cat and floats around and has a lot of internal monologing in his weird voice. And his sister has blue hair and is a big whore.\nAnd the main character has a crush on some chick. So basically throughout the movie he has little ""out bursts"" or whatever and kills people in horrible ways. And the whole time the girl is like ""I love you and I'll stay with you even though you're all freakish and whatnot"" And in the end she takes his demon seed and has a freak baby or something, that kills him and destroys the world I think or something like that. That's about all I got from the story, because it was poorly done and the 80's music was distracting.\nAlso I think the whole thing with dudes licking eachothers faces and sperm off of cheerleaders kind of creeped me out and made me not want to watch it.\nThe japanese are wacky."

I would love, love, LOVE to play Hermione in the Harry Potter movies.

If there's already a # in the key signature, it doesn't matter.  When the F is double sharped, you start from F natural and go up two to G natural.  \n\nIn measure 34, the first F double sharp means that all F's (on that line) will be double sharped.  But the third F is one octave above the first F, so it has to have a double sharp as well.  Double sharps carry through the measure, but only at their pitch.  So if you have a note that is the same tone but different pitch, then it has to be double-sharped again.\n\nSo if your F one octave middle C is double sharped, then all F's one octave above middle C in that measure are double sharped and don't need the sign in front of it.  But if you have an F two octaves above middle C, then that has to be sharped.\n\nHey, if worst comes to worst, just listen to the CD and play by ear.  If it sounds weird, then try something else...good luck!

Don't listen to them.  The movie is fantastic.  To tell you the truth, it's actually much funnier than Spanglish.  This movie has a combination of emotion, comedy, drama, and more comedy.  I wish I could tell you everything about the movie, but I'd take away all the details.  Ignore the rumors and just watch it.
a guy walks into the dentist office and says he wants to have a tooth pulled with no drugs for pain , he has a tee time at the nicest golf course in town and he's not going to miss it, the dentist looks at him and says ok,which tooth is it , the guy turns around and yells at his wife to get in here and tell him which tooth hurts.

Thanks for the heads up on it!  I used to giggle at this show when I was a child, but found a brand new appreciation for it as an adult.  Kudos to TV Land for bringing these old favorites back on the air :)

To find a good, basic violin, search eBay under antique or vintage violins......Look for the Strad copies from around 188--1910.....These are mass-produced German/Czech violins, the type that our grandmothers or great-grandmothers ordered from Sears Roebuck and Wards mail order catalog......They will run from $100 to $300, depending upon age and condition. When these types of violins are fitted with a low bridge, they usually have a very good bright tone, with good sustain, and because of the wear and age, are easy to play.  Find a bow with some age on it, eBay, fleamarket, etc., preferably a Glasser horsehair bow.  With these two items combined, you should have a violin set that sounds good, and is easy to play.......very, very important when you are beginning to learn......The best fiddle players I've heard are self-taught......I've found a lot of instructors just have too much ego going with an adult player, and sometimes it's better to grasp at a few basics own your own. I have played and built violins for over 20 years. Good luck to you.
What do you mean by shorts out?\n\ndo you mean that there is an actual electrical short, or that the sound cuts out every now and then?\n\nif the first, and there is a wiring problem, then it is because wire have come loose and are touching other exposed wires.  you can take off the cover (depending on the make and model of guitar, you may have to go in through the pick ups) and find the loose wire(s)  and solder them.  \n\nor, simply take the guitar to a guitar shop and have them look at it.\n\nit could be anywhere. in the guitar if this happens, but if it does, the guitar will most likely not work after the first time it does.\n\nIf it is the second, and the guitar cuts out every now and then while playing, it can be a few things.\n\none-the output jack that you plug the cable into is loose, and can be fixed with solder.\n\ntwo- the cable itself is shot, and should be replaced. you can troubleshoot this by pluging the guitar into the amp with another cord.\n\nthree-if you are using a pedal, try bypassing the pedal, just connect the guitar right into the amp.  and see if that changes anything, it may be a loose wire in the pedal.\n\nor, maybe the 9volt in the guitar is old, and can be replaced.

"""Lo Mucho Que Te Quiero"" by Rene & Rene, Dec. 1968"
Neither.  Never heard of them either.
I would say the Jose Gonzalez version. The original Knife version is fun, spiky pop, but Jose brings out a depth and emotional resonance in the song that I doubt even its authors thought it could contain. Which for me is the mark of a great cover version - when it throws a completely different perspective on a tune rather than slavishly copying it note for note. Good question.

The Suzuki method is a way of teaching, or educational philosophy, most often used in learning to play music. The Suzuki method was first developed for the study of the violin but has been adapted for flute, recorder, piano, guitar, cello, viola, bass, organ, harp and voice.\n\nRecently, however the Suzuki method has been challenged in the educational arena by the Hyundai method which is significantly cheaper to administer than the Suzuki method.

The Knock Knock joke , or gnoona gnoona joke as it was originally called , was devised by Henndrick Driedler , a successful first world war stand-up comedian . It is said that he invented the joke whilst trying to return to his deaf landlady's lodgings . Each time he knocked on the door , the landlady would ask who was there , he would say Herr Driedler , at one point after she thought he had said Hair Dryer he realized the potential humor in the situation and sat outside writing down other jokes until the end of the war .\n'why did the chicken cross the road' is credited to an Irishman - Seamus O'Reilly who actually carried out scientific experiments to find out why his chicken crossed the road - after three hard years he concluded that it was indeed to get to the other side . However, at his lecture on the subject ( Birmingham 1897 ) his peers fell about laughing and so , after much deep thought , he re-invented his paper as a joke , which has become the classic we all know and love . His descendants live a life of luxury , living off the royalties of this single joke .

"Jennifer was born on July 24, 1969 in the Castle Hill section of the Bronx. Her father, David, was a computer technician. Her mother, Guadalupe, taught kindergarten. Jennifer is the middle of three daughters. Her elder sister, Leslie, is a housewife who sings opera. Her younger sister, Lynda, is a DJ on New York's WKTU, a VH1 VJ., and a morning news show correspondent on New York's Channel 11. Jennifer's parents were born in Puerto Rico, but did not meet until both came to America. Her mother's parents were Europeans who settled in Puerto Rico. She says that it was her parents' work ethic that made a difference in her life. Jennifer took singing and dancing lessons from age 5. She attended 12 years of Catholic school, including an all-girl high school. She played softball and tennis in high school and was a gymnast.\n\nAfter high school, she briefly worked in a law office. During this time, she continued dance classes at night. At 18, she left home because her mother was scared by her decision to pursue show business. With casting on ""In Living Color"" (1990) in 1990, she moved to L.A., but initially hated it. Finally her boy friend, David Cruz, moved to be with her there and she learned to accept her new environment. Her career took off from her ""Living Color"" stint and reached new peaks with her portrayal of slain Latino singer Selena (1997) in 1997.\nRelationships\n\nLópez is notorious for her multiple relationships. She has been married three times, and dated numerous men during her career.\n\nHer first marriage, to waiter Ojani Noa, occurred on February 22, 1997. He was later named the manager of López' restaurant, Madre's. They divorced in January 1998. On April 10, 2006, López sued Noa, claiming he breached a confidentiality agreement he signed by shopping around a tell-all book about their relationship.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, she dated rapper and producer Sean ""Diddy"" Combs (then known as Sean ""Puff Daddy"" or simply ""Puffy"" Combs). Both were arrested in connection with a nightclub shooting in December 1999. Police found them in possession of a stolen gun. The charges against López were dropped. Combs was indicted but was eventually tried and acquitted. The adverse publicity caused a great deal of stress on the relationship, and their breakup was announced (ironically enough) on Valentine's Day, 2001.\n\nHer second marriage was to Chris Judd, her former backup dancer. She met Judd while filming the music video for her single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"". The two were married on September 29, 2001 at a home in a Los Angeles suburb officiated by attorney Barry Hirsch. The marriage ended in June 2002, during which time she reportedly had started dating actor Ben Affleck.\n\nLópez announced her engagement to Affleck in October 2002, after Affleck gave her a ring worth a reported $3.5 million. The marriage, planned for September 14, 2003 in Santa Barbara, California, was called off just a few days before the event. She and Affleck split for good in January 2004. Their relationship was parodied on the South Park episode, ""Fat Butt and Pancake Head"" that aired on April 16, 2003. By this time López was involved with singer Marc Anthony, who was married at that time.\n\nLópez married Anthony in a secret wedding on June 5, 2004, less than a week after his divorce was finalized from former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres. The guests were invited to an ""afternoon party"" without knowing that they were going to a wedding. Years before they married (or even became a couple), she and Marc Anthony sang a song together called ""No Me Ames"" which appeared on her album On The 6.\n\nAlmost immediately, rumors began that the ceremony was a ""shotgun"" and that López was pregnant. López had said in the past that, as a practicing Catholic, she would never have a baby without being married. Complicating the situ"
It was a Thanksgiving show of Mad About You and somehow they kept botching the turkey and Paul would head off to get another one. Part of the fun was watching how they tried to sneak the turkeys into the apartment without all their guests noticing.\n\nThe other one was when Woody got married on Cheers and the priest got drunk and Sam always ended up in that elevator thingy that some kitchens have to serve food to different floors.

"Magneto lost his powers. here is the story.\n\nWith an army of mutants at his disposal following the deadly Legacy Virus being cured, Magneto declared war on mankind. Yet again, Magneto was opposed by the X-Men, and in the ensuing clash he was severely injured by Wolverine. Recuperating, Magneto was powerless to prevent Sentinels controlled by Xavier’s genetic twin Cassandra Nova from decimating the island. Magneto was again believed dead, and after a recording purported to contain his last words was found, mutant supremicist ideals became widespread in the mutant community, with some adoring him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto seemingly returned with a vengeance, infiltrating the Xavier Institute as the mutant healer Xorn, co-opting the Special Class as his new Brotherhood, and launching an attack on Manhattan. Killing Jean Grey before being killed in turn by Wolverine, it was later revealed that this Magneto was an imposter. The true Magneto was still in Genosha, where he joined Xavier in rebuilding the shattered nation. Following the dissolution of the Avengers after the Scarlet Witch suffered an apparent breakdown, Magneto rushed to her aid. When the X-Men and a new Avengers team met to discuss her fate, it seemed as though Magneto coerced her into altering reality, creating a world where mutants were the dominant species and lived openly without fear with himself as ruler. It was later revealed that Magneto's son Quicksilver was the one who actually convinced the Scarlet Witch to alter reality, in an attempt to appease their father, as well as the X-Men and Avengers who threatened to put the Scarlet Witch down. \n\nFollowing the events of ""M-Day,"" Magneto has apparently lost his mutant powers. Rather than kill him, Wolverine decided to let him live the rest of his life as the thing he hates the most... a human."

Doc went further into the future to see Marty's son commit a crime, then went back a few days (with Marty) before the crime happened. You see, if the crime didn't happen yet, it can be changed. I don't know if that answered your question or not. Basically, as long as the event hasn't physically and chronologically happened yet, it can be changed.
Well, there is CIVILIZATION where you could make a WWI-style game. Aside from that, you'll have to ask the usual game companies. There's not much a demand on WWI games as there are WWII because the Second World War was more a 'romantic' war. The 'War To End All Wars' was more a quagmire where the armies and navies didn't move much until close to the end.
no not really but its a good movie and its a step and Indian movies changing their concepts so its something positive

"Here is an explanation from The Phrase Finder supporting the Saint Peter hypothesis:\n\n: : What is the origin/menaing For Pete's Sake?\n\n: Biblical origins. Think of St Peter. Think of the omnipresent medieval church and think of hitting your thumb with a hammer. You can't swear, else the local priests will have you up before the Bishop and the Lord alone knows what the outcome of that will be, so you exclaim, in appropriate tone of voice, ""For Saint Peter's sake"" and carry on erecting the shelves. This phrase was amended to ""For Pete's Sake"" in later, less religiously oppressive, times.\n\n: This is called a ""minced oath,"" a substitution of a less offensive word."

Simmons began using Rev Run as a stage name after he was ordained as a reverend priest in Zoe Ministries.\n\nThe reason he did it is because I think he's better known that way. After all, people in the hip-hop generation will not him by his birthname."

I don't think either person is better or worse. They both have good/bad traits. Of course, being married to Brad Pitt and then losing him to Angelina wasn't fun.  But you know I always believe if it was meant to be, it will be.  You cannot force people to stay in a marriage if they don't want to.  So life gives you some kinks, you have to learn to live with it.  Jennifer Anniston is living her life now with a better attitude.  So maybe Angelina helped her find herself.  But everything takes time. There's no right answer.  Everyone is human and everyone has their own faults. So don't throw insults when you actually don't know what is involved in their life.
I think a alarm clock, they are so annoying, but you just about cant live with out them.
The only way to ensure that is to go into distribution yourself, which thankfully is MUCH easier nowadays thanks to the internet.\n\nThough, if you absolutely need to, there are plenty of independent record labels you might want to give a shot. Just make sure they aren't a part of the RIAA. Because they will for certain screw you.\n\nif you're really serious about it, I suggsest you either get an agent or an lawyer.

I am moral too.   One time, I spent around 55 bux (56 songs, thereabouts) on iTunes for my iPod.  :-)   With my iTunes gift cards, I spent 39 bux just a few days ago for some new ones I really liked.\n\nI usually gravitate towards: electronica, world, some new-age (few nice ones among a lot of crap), Native American, polka, alternative, some Gregorian chants, instrumental (fave is flutes and drums).   I usually go for those that have no lyrics.

"They are ""smooth jazz"" stations, not really jazz. ""Smooth jazz"" is the latest trend in jazz programming. They include mellow jazz people like Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Fourplay, Kenny G, etc along with mellow adult contemporary singers like Steely Dan, Sting, Sade, Norah Jones, yes Celine Dion, and people like that. A lot of times these singers have jazz elements. Of these people listed, Steely Dan, Sade, and Norah Jones certainly have elements of jazz."

once again,nice to see a image fan but a bit depressing to see so many non-image readers.comparing the demons from marvel to demons from spawn is almost comical,no pun intended.\n\nthis fight wouldnt be all that fair at all,the five demons would wade right through these chumps,taking out fools left and right.\n\nadamantium,wolverine?what thoughts go through his head I wonder as his adamantium ribs are bent back and his heart devoured before his very eyes?\n\nice man woulde be gone after taking a blast of necroplasma or shattered with a blow from vandalizers mace.\n\nI dont know how many of the x-men can survive being covered in demon acid but I suspect its few.\n\nnightcrawler would be using his teleportation mostly for dodging attacks,same with with beast and his agility.both would dance and hop around,likely being amongst the last to be devoured.\n\narchangel has the potential to get some good hits in from above but not doing any real damge before finally getting swatted like a fly,by vertabreaker I suppose,hes the biggest.\n\nstorms elemental attacks are worthless,and anyway each phlebiac brother has an elemental breath blast anyway,ice,fire,electric, and then necroplasma and acid\n\ncyclops manages to put an eye out on vacillator,lets give him that,and then winds up punching the heck out of a demon kneecap or two and maybe kicking a shin before becoming goo on the football fields turf.\n\nis xavier with them?I hope so,ive been wanting to see that overrated gimp get taken down.telapathy? wont work on the phlebiac demons any more than a jedi mind trick works on a hutt.\ntelekinisis?all the demons have that as well,id like to see a telekinisis battle between them though,just out of good measure before they eat his mighty brains.

DBGT is the biggest let down in the history of Anime if you ask me. I thought that the next stage after DBZ was going to be this amazing saga of action and unique villains, but instead it turned out to be a really silly series that didn't anything but make loyal DB and DBZ fans hate the new path of the franchise. Its like the whole Matrix syndrome, because you know how bad the last one is, and how the series is going to end it takes the fun out of viewing the first parts. GT tried to one-up DBZ by being over the top, instead it was a piece of animated crap which just wasted artist and developers time, energy, end money.\nPeace.

marvel is better in my opinion. this is because their stories are more realistic, their characters easier to connect to, and they have more down to earth qualities.
she is an instant hottie. the reason is b/c she had a baby 3 yrs ago and feels more confident in her body. omg i met her and she is so pretty!! but i was so stupid i didnt say anything cuz i couldnt belive she was 3 in.away from my face.

the character's were all REALLY good... but I would have to say the penguins, and the Giraffe. (I love when he wakes up in the crate up-side down and starts freakin... hahaha) David Shwimmer does a good voice for that character.
When I was about 5 I begged and pleaded with my uncle to drive his go-cart around in this parking lot. I told him that I knew I could handle it..  He said this is the gas and this is the brake. Do not hit them at the same time.  First thing I do (with my cousin Brian hanging on the side) is jam them as hard and as far as I can go. Now the thing is JAMMING around the parking lot at full speed with no ability to stop.  My grandpa stood in front of me for a second with his hands out like he could magically make me stop. Totally hilarious.  My poor cousin Brian's knee was totally bouncing on the ground so he tore the heck out of his new courderoy pants and tore up his knee.  My sister described the sound of my voice as AAAAAAAAaaaa hhhhh..   As I got further away I sounded less loud.  I almost hit a telephone pole..  Finally I stalled it out in this field with melons in it..\nSheesh... what a goof.  I'm amazed that I didn't take my poor grandfather out.
"Film trailers are film advertisements. They are shown before the screening of another movie, at a cinema where the films will be exhibited, as well as in the lobby and on Internet. They are more formally known in theaters as previews of coming attractions. The term ""trailer"" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film programme. Although that practice did not last long, due to patrons tending to leave the theater after the films proper were finished, the name has stuck."
The P2P programs such as LimeWire, BearShare, Kazaa, etc. can be used to download music for free. \nHowever, i warn you that downloading music/movies using them, is illegal.\nDownload at personal risk.

"if you are talking about runway models --- no... kate moss is an exception at 5'7"" tall.  Designers make haute coutour clothes for tall women -- they fall better on tall lanky figures.  However - there are MANY other types of models other than just runway fashion models...  and I am pretty sure if you are not modeling on a runway, you don't have to be extraordinarily tall."

Death Cab For Cutie, A Lack of Color from their Transatlanticism album, that's a great song.
Exactly! I'm wondering the same thing you are. They've got some pretty awesome songs to their credit, my personal favourites being Staring At The Sun and Come Get Some. They'll gain a whole lot of popularity eventually, I'm just thinking why they are't as famous as they should ideally be already. One reason is they don't play it on radio stations as often as some of those garish James Blunt songs but yeah, I hope people sit up and take notice. These people have some great talent.
hahaha. ^_^ i agree with everything you said. i guess they're too just greedy for points so they answer everything although it make them look like a total idiot. ^_^ just ignore them. we know better. ^_^

Go to the search page and use keywords to search for people who might have the same interests.  You can also choose male or female, etc. on that page.  After you get a list, just start looking at other people's pages until you find some that may interest you.  Just keep in mind it's all trial and error so be patient and eventually you'll have made some new friends.
You could use the old school approach- use mono filament line, such as super-thin clear fishing line. Experiment with the film angles and lighting to get decent footage where the lines are not visible. That's how they did it for decades, not only in stop motion, but live action films (see just about any 1950s Grade-B sci-fi/horror/alien invasion film to see how NOT to do it, where the lines are completely visible) Digital editing is a nice idea, but it kind of does away with the whole idea of stop motion- if you can digitally manipulate the back ground, why stop there? why not just digitally manipulate all the action as well?

Nope! I'm watching videos (well really listening to them) right now! Just go through some of the artists in the lists and rate some music. Then when you click to watch one music video, it will play something else that you rated as 'I love it' or 'I like it'. or it will play something in the same genre, or popular music! i listen and watch music and videos on yahoo all the time! have a nice day! :)

I didn't really have a problem with him until he started mouthing off about Brooke Shields and her postpartum depression, telling her it wasn't real. I'm not a Brooke Shields fan, but has Tom Cruise ever given birth?
I think it was almost like someone who had never seen the show wrote the ending? Will and Grace would not have fought like that! For years? no way. Jack take care of Karen? Interesting but not with the story line. It was a let down defiantly!
I started playing a few games starting with the Age of Empire series, because I was fascinated by the ability to move those little guys to cut trees, collect berries and mining.  The fighting part was OK, but it seems that it required speed, hot keys and just overwhelming opponents with number.\nI am playing Total War Rome now.  It is still fun.  Even though I miss the little guys doing chores, I found the cinematic fighting scenes are much better.  It is like watching a movie.  The fighting technique is much different.\nGive it a try and you might even find more people to play with on line.
